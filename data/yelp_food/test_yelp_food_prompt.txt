mexican	i 've been here several times and always gotten high quality ( for the bell ) food and good , prompt service .
mexican	their salsa is to die for and i have not found another place that can compare ! yummy !
mexican	a very consistent chipotle with tasty menu options , fast service and pretty affordable / healthy mexican food .
mexican	the decor is really fun and the food was very good . even a basic sandwich tastes yummy with hatch chilies on it . they are having a big birthday bash for charity next saturday so check it out .
mexican	the highlight of this restaurant is the salsa bar . you can go and help yourself to a variety of salsas and fresh chips . i would absolutely recommend the blue corn santa fe enchilada . this is definitely a different twist on mexican style food . the blue corn gives the tortilla a different pleasant type texture . it is also served with a side of polzole and beans . the beans are served in a smoky sauce which is more southwestern style , reminiscent of baked beans . also don 't skip on getting a frozen margarita ! they have a variety of flavors to choose from and they are very tasty .
mexican	loved the patio seating , and a fun place to go for a quick date night , or meeting with some girlfriends . the tacos are very good , but small so if you 're a big eater you might want to get a little extra . it can get busy quick ( especially at night ) , so make sure to come a little ahead of time to grab some parking and put your name down on the list . have fun !
mexican	the ceviche is totally worth it . quite a few taco flavors and some specials . decent drink menu . the food was all good , especially the baja fish tacos . fresh tortillas and chips - guac was also pretty good . as the other reviews suggest this place is pretty small , not good for parties and also not great for dates ( as you will probably have to sit next to someone you don 't know ) ... server was nice and made good recommendations .
mexican	the service was great , had a great waitress . what we really loved was that i asked for her to charge our phone and she brought a portable charger to our table ( a - m - a - z - i - n - g ) . we really enjoyed the guac , which had pomegranate seeds on top .... so delicious . i had the chicken fajitas .... which had a good flavor but a bit burn : ( but the food was pretty good , my friend enjoyed his tacos .
mexican	the tableside guacamole is awesome though , if you have an appetite , you 'll need to order two . while the menu does not present much of a variety , it is incredibly delicious . you can 't really miss with anything you order here .
mexican	i had the beef fajitas . my husband had the tequila burrito . the serving size of fajitas was huge . the beef was flavorful and sides were plentiful . i loved their extra spicy salsa . you have to ask for the spicy salsa . we will be back . tequila was good too .
mexican	the service was attentive and polite throughout the meal . the plating of the food was one of the things that make this place a cut above - someone in the kitchen is an artist . flavor was excellent in the enchiladas verdes dish that i chose .
mexican	the four of us ordered 8 tapas and 2 desserts , all excellent , especially patatas bravas , meatballs , shrimp and salads . wine was reasonably priced and a bill at $ 200 incl tip seemed just right . we 'll be back .
mexican	they know how to make a first timer feel welcome with their samples . the wrestling to theme is cool good option for tacos or burritos .
mexican	another place close to the light rail and worth the stop off the train riding into town or leaving town .
mexican	the crust was light and flavorful . the filling was tasty and full of veggies , olives , beef , etc .. the setting is cute with indoor and outdoor seating . when i ordered my empanada , the lady put it in the mw first to warm the inside , then in the toaster oven to crisp the outside . even though her steps were appreciated , my empanada was still cold inside and the outside was not flaky nor crisp .... and i waited like 5 minutes .... ! ! still , the taste and the dough were very good . i 'd come back again , but ask for them to take their time with the reheating .
mexican	the bar is nice and cozy and the beer is always cold . good selection of beer too . food is excellent . i usually go for a burrito but sometimes the have very interesting specials that are always great . i had one that used cactus and it was a nice gamble for me . introduced something new for my palate . the chips and salsa as appetizers are amount the best in town . te hot sauce has a good bite and the chips themselves have some good spice . definitely a place to try if you are craving mexican .
mexican	we 've been a few times now & have not had any issues.the service has been great , even considering how busy this place is all the time . the food has been fantastic , and the prices are very respectable . the table side guac seems to be a fan favorite , but we have found the large guac was just as good ... and cheaper . a must try if your in the sw area . ( be prepared to wait , it seems to be very busy all the time )
mexican	went there with a group of 10 for a birthday party since they have big booths and nice ambiance . i had the chicken enchiladas and we ordered the $ 100 tequila drink for kicks , where a " tequila goddess " comes out to make a margarita right at your table . it takes a few minutes as she squeezes lime juice and talks about the liquor that is going into the drink - which is very expensive stuff . the food is excellent and the service is quick . you don 't have to get too dressed up , just don 't come in with flipflops or a tank top . esquire magazine rated it one of the america 's best new restaurants for 2003 .
mexican	the staff is very friendly and the place is well decorated . i love their fish tacos ! ! ! i eat there about 1-2 times a month with my friend over the last 3 years . i have not had a bad experience . i strongly recommend .
mexican	good hot sauce , good chips , excellent machaca tacos . very good red chili burros . cheese enchiladas are a little inconsistent , usually not cooked all the way but very good when they are . can be very busy at times . one note for this and other mexican restaurants . why are people charged more when you order something without rice and beans ? most of the time the amount of food minus the rice and beans is way more than enough . i can 't tell you how many times i see plates with rice and beans left on them . they just get thrown away .
mexican	we went to amanecer first . but thats another deal . come here instead very well priced and good food . will definately come back .
mexican	and their prices are very reasonable . i like that their salsa is on the spicy side . reminds me of tacos back home in california . i recommend the asada tacos and the torta . their meats are very flavorful and well seasoned .
mexican	located at biltmore fashion park . waited about 45 minutes to be sat inside at a booth near the noisy kitchen , the decor was trendy like the new taco joints have become . overall the food was prepared well that 's described in my several pictures . was impressed with the chicken fajitas , ceviche , chips , & guacamole . chicken mole was good . only memorable criticism is store bought salsa that was surprising to us with a prominent mexican restaurant ...
mexican	best eggs benedict i 've ever had . had to wait about 35mins to get a table but it was well worth the wait . i had the brie , avocado and bacon signature bennies . everything was cooked to perfection and the staff were very efficient and friendly . i would definitely come back ! .. even if i have to wait again .
mexican	accommodating staff and great music play list . we tried almost everything on the tapa menu and some stand outs are : beef tartare , anchovy potato salad , and chicken wings . this restaurant is a great addition to the neighbourhood and the vibe and food can attest to it . i think we found our new hangout ! ps . we liked the music so much and the owner came to talk to us about it !
mexican	easy to miss , it 's tucked away next to the ultrastar threater . far better than any of the other local alternatives ( rio mirage , macayos ) . food is great , salsa is incredible , and staff is very friendly . great environment too . a must try , you won 't be sorry .
mexican	) . love the localized theme for the unc charlotte crowd . they even offer a 20 percent discount for students . the food is great , and the prices are fairly reasonable . one element of this place i really like is their hot sauce bar . there 's a hot sauce for everyone 's palate , and they pair great with the tacos and burritos . i recommend their burritos ! get them wet if you order them , you 'll thank me later ....
mexican	its obviously under good management . a nice young lady at the cash register was very helpful to us , she had us do a survey ' tell the bell ' and gave us free cinnamon twists afterwards . the other ladies in the back also seemed cheery and over all had a great and friendly atmosphere !
mexican	the guacamole was delicious and steak tacos too . we were a group of 9 and everyone enjoyed their meal . would go back for sure .
mexican	i fed 6 people for $ 85 . that would never happen in the strip .
mexican	however , the service was so slow i docked them a star .
mexican	i had the el rey burrito with horchata with my boyfriend . pretty filling and my boyfriend bought me a churro afterwards ; super sweet and tasty ! perfect place to visit after marche jean talon .
mexican	first , attentive and fast service . the place was very clean and tastefully decorated . now - to the food ! it was great . i particularly liked my carnitas tacos with added cheese . mushrooms in cheese sauce were pretty good too , even though not plentiful . bacon-wrapped shrimp were very fried though . salsa was delicious and not too runny .
mexican	the food is very good at a very good price . we were visiting from chicago but if we ever come back to this area we will come here again .
mexican	my parents gave me a coupon from an entertainment book to try this place and was amazed at how good the food was . i probably would have never stop in if it wasnt for the coupon but glad i did . i had a chicken burrito and it was great . thanks rumba we will be back
mexican	we found the service and the food above average and better than you would expect from an airport restaurant . we enjoyed the drinks having to go only across the hall the gates . overall , a very nice place .
mexican	i tend to arrive early for lunch or dinner so i 'm not stuck in line - which can take an additional 10-15 minutes . homemade tortillas are excellent and they sell them to go . my favorite dish is chicken tacos on wheat tortillas . they come with cheese , shredded chicken , lettuce , and pico de gallo . beans and rice on the side which are very flavorful . they have an app that 's lets you pay and earn rewards . they seem to be more generous than most restaurants when it comes to points and rewards .
mexican	great for a date spot and intimate dining . this is a gem for pittsburgh locals who have never been to spain to experience spanish tapas and food .
mexican	i tried the carnitas and it was stellar . also , there are very few places that make homemade horchata- and this is one of them . the meal was excellent , the service kind and the prices reasonable . very glad to have them newly in the neighborhood .
mexican	this place is cash only , so make sure to get some before you come . everything is reasonably priced , i ordered pernil with arroz con gandules and that cost $ 6.50 . throw in a can of soda for a dollar and we 're talking about lunch w / tip for about $ 10 . my food was excellent , it reminded me of mi abuela 's cooking . and the portions were huge , so i 'll be having a trip down memory lane for lunch tomorrow too ! 5 stars .
mexican	hard to find a decent mexican restaurant in toronto that serves more than burritos . rarer still is one in the east end . ordered a tacos al pastor which actually had corn tortillas , the pork comes on a plate with fried beans and rice and you get a selection of sauces , onions and limes . with a beer , tax and tip came to under 25 dollars . for that price , you sure can 't beat that .
mexican	had the haddock burrito and fish was cooked nicely . pleasant staff . clean . good beverage selection . too bad not licensed for adult beverages .
mexican	it feels homey , which is a heck of a feat considering it is in the middle of the venetian . casanova blends nice italian red sauce cuisine with pan-mediterranean cuisine . my table got a caesar salad , chicken kebabs and fried halloumi cheese . and all were executed with the easy care of a place around the corner from your house . definitely worth a visit if the other venetian restaurants are full !
mexican	we were very impressed by a number of items , including the enchiladas verde and the chicken tinga tacos . very chill , comfortable ambience and nice staff . we will definitely come back !
mexican	there was a good assortment of meats and they were all cooked perfectly . the sides were very good with sevreral hot and cold options ( the feijoada tastes just like i remember from the places i ate in brasil ) . but let 's be honest , why eat potatoes when there is a spit of tri-tip leaning on the table ? our waitress was friendly and fast . kids under 5 eat free .
mexican	first comes with chips and three different salsas . we always get the fajita . and there 's always lots to choose from their menu . too bad that they took off the green peppers with steak wrapped outside ... : (
mexican	i 've always gotten the tvp with guacamole , brown rice , whole wheat wrap , home made " cheese . " very filling , to the point of being cold weather food . take out with a few bar style seats . hey , chef guy , smile : )
mexican	new favorite place to eat . my wife and i went here because we wanted to celebrate her graduation . corrine was our server and had great recommendations for what we would want . she was so fast to take care of all of our needs and had a lot of great bussers filling water and drinks . our drinks did not go even half full . i had the stacked shrimp enchiladas with red and green sauce and a fried egg on top . it was flavorful and smokey . my wife had the mini chimi and mushroom enchilada . she loved it and we we filled so we took some home . chips and salsa were very flavorful . new favorite .
mexican	in this case , those parts are : -casual and sunny patio -friendly service -strong margaritas -fresh chips , salsa , and guac -simple tacos and sides sure , individually those things are good , but when you have them all together -- it creates such a fun , delicious experience in dtlv . you won 't walk away saying , " those were the best tacos ever , " or " man , i could eat three more servings of beans and rice , " but you will have great time at la comida .
mexican	i crave them all the time . best ! i really wish they had a physical address instead of the farmers markets . i would be going there a lot more .
mexican	had both ; equally good . i guess for a tourist the idea of sitting in a jamppacked , really loud small restaurant that 's fun ( u can avoid the line by getting pick up / take out ; trust me , sitting inside ain 't that great ! ) . the main moves quickly , also been around a long time . i hesitate to tell all of this , mostly because selfishly i like that it 's quiet . maybe just stand in the schwartz line after all , less headache for me ! or unselfishly ; save yourself time and hassle ; try the main .
mexican	great happy hour specials on food and drinks , plus it goes from 3-7pm . the food here is the hidden secret , try the " award winning crunchy pork tacos " or the mexican street cart tacos , my two favorites . my friends and i always hit up loco patron for taco tuesday , sporting events , or any other special events on mill ave ! ! !
mexican	well , maybe not , but they are damn good ! get the breakfast burrito and add potatoes and you will be happy . they have amazing green salsa on the salsa bar . any place with a salsa bar deserves at least 4 stars in my humble opinion . you 'll probably want to go inside and get your order to go as opposed to going through the drive through so you can get as many little plastic cups of salsa as possible . that 's my strategy at least . they also have really delicious bean burritos . i 've tried just about every bean burrito in tempe and these are by far the best .
mexican	i love the menu and the empanada " glam shots " on the walls ! very well thought out and attractive ! we were served by one of the owners and everything he recommended was delightful--the soup , the beef , chicken and humita empanadas were beautifully wrapped and so comforting to eat : d the owner was so kind and attentive . they 've elevated the humble empanada to stand alone ! the beef and chicken are especially good with a drizzle of lemon . the wraps were nice and crusty . i also had the beet salad which was good and the tomato , cheese , basil empanada but since i 'm not vegetarian i preferred the meat ones more : d
mexican	we enjoyed the rabas , gambas ajillo , albondigas , patatas bravas , a tomato salad and 2 beers . it was such a beautiful night on the outdoor patio overlooking the canal , and server jorge was awesome to chat with--he took good care of us . we couldn 't have asked for a better birthday dinner for my husband ! next time we are in scottsdale , we 'll be back ! i hear happy hour is amazing .....
mexican	especially loved their guacamole which was made at the table and included cranberries ! never had that before.the rest of the meal was pretty good too .
mexican	but , it 's a wonderful setting . whether you 're inside or out . margaritas are good ... but not divine . gotta say barrio queen does a teeny better . is more competitively priced . i do love their guacamole . gosh it 's good . overall someplace i keep going because the service is great . the food is better than ... and the setting is charming
mexican	after many , many visits , i can say ... every single time i have eaten here , the food has been delicious and the wait staff is friendly . the restaurant is beautifully , newly decorated . what a find ! and thank you , victor , for all the fun ! !
mexican	absolutely wonderful , the staff is always consistent and so nice ... ps the green avocado sauce is to die for , i could bathe in it .. like everyone else says , don 't be scared by the outside appearance .
mexican	will carve out a nice niche , better than america 's but not quite as pricey and crowded as barrio queen . the salsa bar makes and highlights the best chips in the area , best experienced as part of the brussels sprout nachos .
mexican	same quality add other locations , great beer , great happy hour !
mexican	grillies has modern clean interior , very nice staff and very good food . price 's fair for better quality fast food .
mexican	they have just opened and one must be forgiving of a mixed up order . i was here during their training week and got a free meal . it was a great surprise and was tasty as expected .
mexican	ordered some taco plates , asada fries and a churro . portions were great and the food was even better . ordered delivery and there were no problems with the order , even added the requested salsa . seemed like the delivery driver really cared about our order and taking care of us . we will definitely be stopping by for some asada fries again .
mexican	the frantically fantastic owner and his staff aim to please with some very well executed fresh takes on the hot dog . do yourself a favor , imagine a caribbean breeze , and sample the colombian dog .
mexican	the aria hotel is simply beautiful and modern . julian serranos brings the customers in from the outside and it is well worth the price . the taste and presentation was exceptional . we especially enjoyed the creamy risotto and scallops . a couple speciality drinks later and we were ready to tackle the vegas nightlife . this is a great place to start off your evening . don 't expect a private quiet dinner , this place is open , fun and loud .
mexican	2 hour layover in phoenix . just wanted to sit down and eat something . this place was amazing , great service great food , forgot we were in an airport . made the layover enjoyable .
mexican	abel and danny -are the best- especially abel - great happy hour amazing food ! ! ! you have to try it . it 's the only restaurant in the azcenter worth going to .
mexican	make sure to try there ' pulled yam ' burrito .. also love there rancho chicken burrito , fried fish , , even there faux chicken and beef are awesome . not typical ground round but actual beef texture pieces .. better quality ingredients then other burrito shops . great value , good sizes and quick service . definitely one of . , if not the best place to eat in the neighbourhood .
mexican	found this place just after moving to madison & have gone back time & again . the staff is friendly ; the place is clean ; the food is great ; & prices are reasonable . my favorite are steak tacos on corn tortillas . do not skip the onions ! they make all the food on site & the pickled onions ( slightly hot ) at the end of the condiment bar are so flavorful that you 'll want a heaping helping .
mexican	affordable , wonderful food - definitely try the sausage and the meatballs ! sangria was fantastic . ambiance was wonderful - sat outside . tremendous value for las vegas ! well worth the trip off the strip . would most definitely go back again !
mexican	a great place to hang . had the tuna tacos love 'd em !
mexican	all the ingredients are very fresh . carne asada is very smoky and tasty . the spicy guacamole is out of this world . i 'll be chasing this guacamole recipe next time i make some .
mexican	must try ! ! ! the onion rings and fries are so good ! ! ! ! the clam chowder is packed full of seafood ! i get the tacos every time , which is 3 + days a week ! it 's that good ! they are healthy too ! you don 't feel guilty eating them , that 's the best part ! ! this place totally takes you to hawaii !
mexican	awesome amazing service starving and this place made me smile got the two enchilada one with green chile pork the other with short rib and their chicken with corn bread taco this place exceeded all expectation
mexican	great food . yummy margaritas . i make sure my dollars support latinos .
mexican	the tortillas are hand pressed fresh for each order and are amazing , light and have a perfect chew . i tried several meats , all were very good . very friendly service .
mexican	right on the water in the grand canal shops at venetian . we were here last night and got a seat right at the railing of the water , it was stunning . service was superb , attentive but not overly in your face . food was excellent but i thought overpriced for what it was , but it is the strip so to be expected .
mexican	always expect a line but the food is totally worth it . the jalapeño sauce is awesome .
mexican	great environment with an affordable price . family and traditional mexican party style restaurant ! greatly recommend it ! the ranchero molcajete is amazing ! with beef short ribs , chicken steaks , chorizo sausage , nopal and queso fresco in a molcajete sizzling straight out the oven !
mexican	mariachi band was on point . get the house special with diablo sauce .
mexican	no frills- just delicious . buy some homemade tortillas to take home !
mexican	awesome and authentic food - you won 't be disappointed - it 's a quality place - go and eat till your hearts content - go and a see précaz he 's the main man
mexican	awesome and authentic mexican food , great service too , will recommend to anyone !
mexican	medium sauce got kick . afraid of the xxx one .
mexican	blown away by the juiciness and flavors . try their beef tongue tostada and you will be in heaven ! ! ! it 's that good . they also have an all you can eat radish station : ) pretty cool to munch on them to clear your palette in between tacos or just for a good old crunch ... ps we paid more money for a cab to get there that for the actual food ... but so worth it . so happy we tried it . definitely coming there again .
mexican	a definite must if you 're in the area . only downside is that the portions are smaller and chips / salsa are extra . located in the hip & cool melrose district . dogs are welcome on the patio .
mexican	the decor on the inside is colorful and fun , great for families . my only concern is that after we were served our food , it was difficult to get the waitress 's attention . we had to ask for a drink refill and was not told until waiting for quite awhile that our check had been waiting for us at the counter . kind of a weird experience , but i guess now we know . we will be going back since the food was spot on . : )
mexican	lunch was outstanding , and seriously , the food was up quick . not a ton of seating , three 4 tops in the back , and two tables and a dinner style bar up front .
mexican	tacos are huge and come with guac ... abodaba and carne asada are perfect . chips and a variety of salsas while you wait !
mexican	awesome and large menu everything tastes very fresh , everyone i have brought here loves it .
mexican	fairly quick service - was pretty busy on a wednesday night . meat was seasoned perfectly and was so tender . will be back soon
mexican	and sometimes when it 's really busy , they take you to magical rooms of the building that you don 't even know exist for extra seating . but really everything is good here .
mexican	the usual fare but this place makes it spicier than the rest somehow . nice restaurant and beautiful decor . good eats and atmosphere .
mexican	and the service was excellent . i was so crushed when they closed the restaurant down , but when i heard that they were open for business again i was extremely excited ! the new location is fresh and modern with the same great tasting food ! the margarita was so good ! they used organic tequila !
mexican	a perfect mix of healthy options but not sacrificing flavor . i had the tallarin saltado with chicken and it was awesome . can 't wait to go back again .
mexican	a pitcher of margaritas . the guacamole is not what you might expect , but really good . carnitas , fajitas , enchiladas ... amazing sauces , unique appetizers .. indoor or outdoor dining . service good , could be better . take a walk along the waterfront after dinner .
mexican	pricey , however filling . definitely will visit again . it seems like really good drunk food .
mexican	been coming here since 2012 and everything has been consistent . great customer service , which is a breath of fresh air from most fast food establishment .
mexican	love this place ! super cheap pricing too . can 't go wrong : ) i ordered 10 asada tacos and the asada combo plate . i loved everything but the tacos were perfectly seasoned and marinated . i just want more and more ! !
mexican	bright me back to miami . stay constant . i went for lunch today with my wife and the place was packed and very much shorthanded however they performed beautifully and keeping up with all of their clients . the only thing i can say is if you 're from south florida and enjoy flying there is is very different than what you 're used to but they still have great food
mexican	i brought my parents and sister here , who are visiting from out of town , and they liked it a lot . we got the $ 3 dip special for happy hour and they got the margarita specials . at the recommendation if our server i had the mole chicken with vegetable arroz . a little spicy and very delicious .
mexican	good service , good food . what more do you want ? chips and salsa , awesome ! looking for a locals place not loaded with tourists . this is it .
mexican	met the best manager ever , carlos . he was super personable , friendly , and such a pleasure to converse with . definitely will be back ! !
mexican	fresh , chunky guacamole is a no-brainer . the mole chicken taco was a personal favorite with pickled onions and smoky sauce . don 't discount the hongos taco either - plenty of hearty mushrooms and cabbage to compete with a meatier taco .
mexican	rick was great and made us delicious margaritas ! ! ! will definitely be back my next time in phoenix ! love the tacos .
mexican	chipotle is done , this place is my mexican fast food staple now !
mexican	the alcohol didn 't hurt either . music was a bit loud , but it didn 't bug me much . food came out hot and perfect , not sloppy at all for how busy it was at 10pm on a weekend . would definitely come back next trip !
mexican	cute plates and silverware . nice bartenders and the food is great ! gvr doesn 't disappoint . they even have skeletons that hold up the limes and lemons xoxo bon appetit
mexican	garage doors are a welcomed change to this unit space . major upgrade from the previous restaurants here . great service ! guacamole and queso was truly on point . they play football games on saturdays . margaritas were fresh squeezed and great . i hope they get flour tortillas here soon ... corn tortillas are just not our thing . we 'll be back ! ! ! !
mexican	throw in the taco special , live music and the fact you can bring your pup and this place is as perfect as it gets in vegas . closed sundays btw ... but that 's ok cause they deserve a break !
mexican	they have a mariachi band , fresh ingredients for guacomole and salsa , great margaritas , and great food . i had the pollo chipotle and it was fabulous . definitely a great place for your go to mexican restaurant .
mexican	they greet you with a warm bowl of tortilla chips that are crispy and fresh and salsa that tastes like they made it just for you . the wait staff is friendly and the food comes out quick , hot and yummy . one of my favorite places to relax and enjoy the cheerful atmosphere
mexican	very hip setting . the food was good although they didn 't give me much salsa or offer any with the tacos , maybe i should 've asked , they also forgot my last order before we closed our tab but overall it was a very good experience i would definitely recommend this place for some tacos and beer
mexican	unique mexican-japanese fusion . make sure to try the korean beef tacos and don 't miss brunch on the weekends !
mexican	portions are quite large , we split a supreme burrito and it was more than enough for two . had the carnitas ( shredded pork ) and it was delicious . they also told us you can call in your order in advance so it 's ready to pick up when you get there ! great !
mexican	.. whole in the wall but delicious . i had the bandeja paisa and it was very flavorful . word of advice if you go there make sure you go there to wait . they take a little longer than a regular restaurant but it 's worth the wait . i will go back
mexican	great service too . came in 15 minutes before they were closing and they took care of us like kings and queens .
mexican	it 's about 7 mins away from the airport , so make sure you stop by . the fish tacos and burros are awesome , also the cheese breads are must haves . things are pretty cheap so feel free to split and share among friends so you can try it all .
mexican	great tortas . awesome staff . the tacos are good the table side guacamole was good . good atmosphere . the margarita section is great too
mexican	great service and $ 1 beers , what could be better .
mexican	boyfriend and i come here all the time . love the green chile pork . staff is super nice . it 's a little hole in the wall , but the food is amazing ! ! oh ... and the beer is cold ! : )
mexican	great experience ! fast service , fresh food ! love the drinks , and the salsa is addictive !
mexican	huge portions , fresh toppings and a great atmosphere .
mexican	not a high class resteraunt by any means and its in an semi industrial area , buit dont let the looks scare you off ! ! go once and you will go back every chance you get !
mexican	only downside is it 's so tiny . sometimes no seats and you have to wait . they really need to expand !
mexican	the best home made tortilla - so soft and thick . makes all the dishes stand out . the quesadilla is the bomb , totally different from the americanized ones we might associate with ( you know , made with store-bought thin dry tortillas ) . it 's lightly fried and folded , so good . less than $ 50 for 5 people 's dinner .
mexican	there are several locations around the arizona valley , but the original in phoenix is the best .
mexican	you will be very lucky to have brian as your server . i definitely reccomend the nacho appetizer . the taco salad with chicken is awesome . the house dressing is amazing . i wish they bottled it and offered it for sale . they now have an outdoor patio which is a lot of fun . the golden margarita pitcher is $ 50 but it is worth every penny . almost everything on the menu is delicious ! you will not regret visiting this place !
mexican	from tortas , to chilequiles to chorizo ! this is a must try !
mexican	jose is a true gentleman , the food is the best !
mexican	all kinds of meat that ... er ... i wouldn 't eat . did i mention it 's authentic ? i had the asada and pastor tacos . i assume by everyone 's smiles that the brain and internal organ tacos were yummy as well . lines for different meats are kinda confusing , but , they help you sort it out . if you are a gringo ( like me ) , bring a mexican . it helps . ; - )
mexican	everything tasted just right with right amount of spices .
mexican	my daughter and i both ordered the pollo guisado , tastes just like my grandma 's recipe ! now i have a place to go when i am craving " eat at home " !
mexican	can 't beat these tacos anywhere in phoenix ! come by and see for yourself !
mexican	omg . it wasn 't until i finished eating that i realized i should 've taken a photo . i savored every moment while eating . not only are they friendly but their tacos are packed with flavor . i 'll definitely make this my go to spot on carson . you can 't beat three dollars tacos .
mexican	another hole in the wall place run by passionate people serving amazing quality food . fish , shrimp , chicken , beef and stemmed fish tried it all . saved on warm fresh soft locally made corn tortillas . the condiments cart is a unique idea making itself serve to create your own flavors . great find while traveling . local gem , must try .
mexican	firefly 's is delicous ! ! ! great food , great enviroment , great drinks , friendly and great service ! what more can a girl ask for ? the food here can only be described as orgasmic ! ! ! im a vegetarian , so it 's great to go to a place that has delicous food for everyone ! trust me ... the food is orgasmic !
mexican	food is phenomenal and the guac is worth ordering . won 't be disappointed ! i have now been there twice and cant wait to go back again . torta : awesome . tacos : awesome . chicken dish thing that i cant remember the name ? : awesome. boxed up what we didnt eat , and forgot it on the table . the server ran out to the road as we were driving to give it to us ... are you kidding me ? how sweet is that ? go. now .
mexican	awesome ! ! awesome ! ! ! fresh food , great service ... ( with a smile ) , and such a variety . price is right with easy pay ! one person , in particular , is so patient , friendly , and helpful . asked him his name today . mario !
mexican	great great great food under $ 10 ! it 's not on the strip but it 's definitely worth going ! love it !
mexican	i have been coming here since day one and crave this place on a regular basis . bean , guacamole , rice , and the mexican combo are the best in toronto ! thanks sandra and family ; ) ps the sangria is wow .
mexican	loveeee this place ! the food is delicious , served quickly and the restaurant is clean . sometimes we want some plantains and some of their amazing arepas , late at night ! love that it 's open late , and the fact that you don 't have to wait long for a plate of delicious goodness ! !
mexican	awesome ! awesome ! my usual go-to is the steak burrito . i don 't know why , i don 't normally order beef but one day i had a craving and now i 'm hooked . it is by the most filling fast food , and if you consider one burrito at lunch might mean you don 't need dinner , $ 8 is a pretty good deal ! add in a boylan 's grape soda for the full experience . i 've had other burritos around town but nothing beats this place .
mexican	period . come here . all your mexican food needs and more . organic and non gmo .. my kind of place . kai and rafael were very welcoming and went above and beyond to give great service .
mexican	awesome . awesome . several of us work nearby and just love this place and their amazing fresh made enchiladas . it 's a really unique idea similar to how chipotle works , but much better food . you saddle up to the counter and choose your fresh tortillas . next choose your main ingredient - pork , short rib , amazing corn bread , etc. then choose your sauces , cheese , and toppings after they oven fire it right in front if you ! yummy ! ! ! !
mexican	great family atmosphere and had a very upscale scottsdale kind of feel without the feeling everyone is trying too hard and giving you dirty looks lol . the flavors were incredibly fresh and bold . absolutely impressed . new fav taco spot
mexican	awesome ! ! awesome ! ! ! the burgers are messy and fresh . which i love ! for the price , and taste of the food , you would be hard pressed to find better . it 's not a big place , and the drive-thru get a little crazy if there 's more then 2 cars , but that doesn 't affect how good the food is !
mexican	the food here was seriously legit . loved all the flavors , the salsas and the smells . i was seriously impressed with the food and cannot wait to go back again and try some different things ! the place was very clean , the staff very helpful and the salsa bar was on point . great atmosphere and great food !
mexican	the way they fill the beer was so cool and the employees were extremely welcoming . we got a huge baja blast freeze with bacardi and that was delicious . the shareables menu was unique as well . all the merchandise was cool too and i hope they sell them online because they didn 't have my size in the shorts . don 't miss out on this place !
mexican	this place is amazing ! the inside decor is beautiful with large wooden chairs , oversized tables , and a very unique style that fits the restaurant . the staff is professionally dressed and extremely welcoming ! and the food is delicious ! extremely generous portion sizes . i had the arroz con pollo which is one of their signature dishes and it was very very good . fish bowl size margaritas ! ! ! a + + + + +
mexican	this place is reason enough to travel to arizona . i went for lunch and was blown away by the guacamole and beef chimichanga . definitely not to be missed if you are staying in or around scottsdale or phoenix !
mexican	the atmosphere was light and fun . a nice break from the crazy strip outside
mexican	i recommend eating in the bar area . being seated in the bar area , at first i was very iffie , but you know the service was very good . i will be coming back to this restaurant when i return to vegas . don 't ask for the hottest salsa ! cuz man it burnt our tongues . you know what it is ? it 's those ghost peppers . it looked like the color of newborn baby poop . people will like it but even the waiter said he wouldn 't eat it because it was soooo hot . it made my sister cry because of how hot it was .
mexican	they use some seriously fresh ingredients to complete and perfect these amazing creations . the tortillas are handmade ( right ? ! ) enough said . not to mention the amazing employees manning the bar and the unusual selection of beers offered on tap .
mexican	awesome taco spot ! on a whim i searched for a taco place with carry out and this place popped up . it 's so good that i ate my food before i was able to upload a picture . the salsa was spicy , the guacamole was nice and fresh and the tortillas were just right . as a californian you 'll fine me constantly poo-poo 'ing las vegas mexican food as inferior but this shop hit a homerun with me !
mexican	bacon , goat cheese and mango guac ! ! get it ! the pastor taco is the best taco i have ever had . the lamb and chrorizo are also great . the one draw back about this place .... come to think of it it 's the only draw back that i can find is the un-appetizing amount of hipsters .... flannel and moustaches as far as the eye can see . i will be back soon !
mexican	tacos were amazing and delicious . we will definately go back and try more of the menu . staff was super friendly . overall great experience
mexican	it 's a great find especially because the apps are half price until closing and there 's a tv here to catch up on games while you enjoy your food ! the bartender shawn is friendly and very attentive as is his partner daniel ! the service is quick and the food is tasty !
mexican	very attentive & customer service orientated . we come back to see him and the rest of the staff ! !
mexican	bbq mahi tacos are a must try . crab dip is awesome too . have good specials daily . always busy so plan accordingly . good drink selection . staff is friendly . food comes out quick . chips and salsa leave something to be desired . chips are always stale .
mexican	dh had street tacos with all of his special instructions . ( they nailed it ) i had the chili rellano plate both were fantastic .
mexican	not in love with enchiladas ( too tomatoe ) . but also enjoy shrimp burrito ----best mexico food on area --wish they were open later
mexican	been to soul several times . grill greek cheese , bone marrow and lamb chops are a favorite .
mexican	i mean , they serve absinthe ! the atmosphere is great , very nicely lit inside , the bar its awesome , and they always have some crazy art on the walls . i also really love their tapas , it 's a great spot to go on a date . everything i 've had there was suuuuper delicious . i also love their specials and they seem to have new ones all the time .
mexican	this is my second visit and both trips have been great . excellent salsa and my favorite dish is the black bean quesadilla with pineapples in it . service has always been good as well . did i mention the beer selection ? : )
mexican	tons of rotating seasonals . the whole staff was great , especially our server , denise . ideal atmosphere to watch the fights .
mexican	asked the hotel consiair for the best local mexican restaurant and they recommend this hidden gem . don 't be fooled by the exterior because the staff and food are primo .
mexican	friendly atmosphere but not pushy . price is average .
mexican	best quality and amazing presentation . stays true to the brazilian style of serving and recipes .... their specialty drink is soooo good too , the infamous national cocktail is the real deal too .... caipirinha
mexican	anything there with pork is money . ordering was a bit tricky as a newbie , but the staff was super friendly and accommodating .
mexican	be sure to go with a group so more plate can be ordered & tried . my group thoroughly enjoyed all our dishes , especially the bacon wrapped dates !
mexican	loved the octopus tacos they were done right no rubbery elastic taste . it is nice casual and they all hustle ! may just have them next time !
mexican	had the palmito salad , churrasco de picanha , a caipirinha and finished with a pudim de leite . bravo !
mexican	perfect size for me--i can never finish a burrito from anywhere . the staff is super friendly as well . they bring you your food and check on you to make sure everything is good .
mexican	definitely my go to spot for burritos in the hood ! !
mexican	everyone here is super nice and very accommodating . the breakfast burritos are huge and well worth the price . we 've asked for them with no meat and added veggies , and always get an assortment of fresh veggies , which is delicious .
mexican	i recommend the crunchy breakfast chipotle burrito ! ! always helpful staff and great prices for what you get
mexican	they 're huge and have the perfect combination in each bite . we loved how you could pick from multiple hot sauce flavors . my burrito was the bacon , egg , cheese and potato . it 's usually my go to choice which gives me a standard in which i use to rate which is best . i ate half and saved the other half for dinner which was the perfect amount .
mexican	had a burrito and dh had the scramble with chorizo . both made to order . fresh ingredients and spicy red and green salsa . always friendly service .
mexican	can 't wait to go back to this place when i visit phoenix . drive through was friendly and prices and portions excellent ! don 't miss this one
mexican	i came with a friend for dinner and was definitely impressed . there was even a man playing guitar and singing spanish love songs . the margs have real fruit and are definitely worth trying . will be back .
mexican	the shrimp tacos are the bomb and the beer is ice cold .
mexican	will go back for dinner for sure ! came here with the whole fam and everyone was impressed . i 'm not a huge brunch guy ( we went for lunch ) but when i looked at the brunch menu i was intrigued ... and i 'm glad i tried it ... really cool twist on eggs benedict with arepas in place of the english muffins . can 't explain how good this was . kids had lunch quesadillas and wife had a chimichanga everything was awesome ... we 'll be back for sure .
mexican	definitely some great happy hour deals and a $ 2 taco of the day
mexican	my chocolate shake was also quite yummy ! love how it looks like a cute little 50 's diner . haven 't tried the mexican food yet , but , i will next time . definitely the place to go if you have a craving for a food burger ,
mexican	shakes are even better . this place is such an epic hole in the wall . the lucky charm milk shake is so good . i have tried numerous places around phornix , the stand , shake shack , and this place is better . very simple and no frills , the basic bacon cheeseburger is one of the best with how they prepare it with their own twists . they taste even better if , prior to visitation , you smoke some animal cookie og . : )
mexican	great customer service . unpretentiously hidden in a strip mall kind of location . don 't let that deter you and your tummy will be glad
mexican	i 've recently started ordering other things on menu and can 't decide what is my favorite menu item . it 's all so good ! ! ! ! the new chencho quesadilla is " da bomb " i drive from across the valley to come here when i crave it .
mexican	really awesome breakfast burritos good service and and fast delivery . wish the burritos were bigger especially for the price but the tortillas are authentic and the eggs are cracked not from a bag . go here after 3pm and get a burger for $ .50 they also have one of those coke machines that gives you a ton of flavor options .
mexican	unique and delicious . i had the brûlée and the husband had the beach house . can 't believe i haven 't heard about this place before . we will definitely be back !
mexican	small , only counter against the walls seating , but great food and atmosphere . i 've been here a few times and the food has always been great ! great for quick take out . the hot dog taco is a fat guys dream come true .
mexican	the green salsa is really yum as well . great addition to columbia . wish were open longer hours ! also , wish they offered corn tacos .
mexican	had a large steak and the thing actually had heft . tasty , fresh with just a hint of cilantro . needed more hot sauce but that was my fault . two jalapeños up !
mexican	huge portions , great ingredients ! ! friendly staff ! ! best burrito i 've ever had was the spicy chipotle chicken ! also loved the pineapple soda ! can 't wait to go back to try the steak !
mexican	got a small mixed chicken and beef burrito bowl , large spicy bbq beef burrito , large fries supreme , and 2 jarritos for $ 32 . good prices , fast service , and delicious food !
mexican	delicious food in burrito or burrito bowl form ( without the tortilla bread ) . generous portions for a great price . i had the spicy pulled pork which was amazing , and a friend had mango chicken which she said was a great combination of savoury and sweet .
mexican	good range of fresh toppings and relatively quick on the preparation . the grilling takes a while , and i see lots of complaints about that , but if they don 't grill it for long enough it will fall apart in your hands as you 're eating it . don 't judge the process , just love the food ! the jarritos are a great drink to wash it down with ... if you haven 't tried them yet , give them a shot !
mexican	i make sure i stop every time i am in vegas . the store is extremely clean and the customer service is great !
mexican	honestly , it doesn 't matter which one you get , they all taste fresh and amazing : ) i personally love the fish one . can 't comment on the service because one of my friends / family always gets them for me . whenever they do however i cannot wait until they get home !
mexican	but the best part is the salsa 's and sauces , the hot sauce is amazing ! love it
mexican	great service and great food . definitely bang for your buck . definitely coming back to this location !
mexican	just go get one ! we always choose this over the chain burrito shops .
mexican	three salsas to choose from and all very good ! bomb tortilla too ! !
mexican	makes me feel sad for chipotle fans that just don 't know .
mexican	the servers were very friendly and let us try like 8 meats before we ordered . i had a side of guacamole , and it was some of the best guacamole . multiple salsas to choose from . i has mild and it tasted like fresh delicious tomatoes with spices . i will def be back .
mexican	we got the shrimp burritos and they were amazing . the chicken empanadas are some of the best i 've tasted .... next time it won 't be just one . chips & salsa are great for sharing along with your food . and those churros are just wow , we ate them first before our dinner ! the service was outstanding as well . we love this place , glad we stopped by .
mexican	we had the white trash and the high roller . excellent ! tell me another place that you can get a burrito delivered to your house , none ! we ordered online which was easy and they were surprisingly fast delivering it . tired of pizza and the usual delivered stuff .... order some burritos !
mexican	primarily tacos and burritos served here and the wait wasn 't bad .
mexican	the josie you came thru at oasis hospital . we will see you at the next stop .
mexican	i 've been coming here for years . the staff and food are great . you must try the red enchilada sauce !
mexican	the red beef tamal was also delish ! next time we visit phoenix , we definitely will fill up at carolina 's ! ! ! muy bueno !
mexican	i have a pretty high tolerance for spicy food , and it was quite spicy . delicious , just very spicy : ) . their tacos are awesome . toppings are very fresh , and the staff is helpful and friendly ! love their salsa bar with the avocado / green salsa blend .
mexican	came here last night after participating in the kent potterfest 5k . i got the quesadilla with chicken and chips with salsa from their salsa bar . so good ! i was so happy that their quesadilla wasn 't greasy or overloaded with veggies or cilantro . it tasted like the quesadilla from my favorite tex mex restaurant chevy 's ( wish we had one in ohio ) ! the salsa bar had so many options and service was fast and friendly ! will be back for sure ! ! !
mexican	came here our first night in town . best hot sauce ever . great service . friendly and huge menu . ate here two years ago and had to go again . guess what i 'll be back for a third time .
mexican	had a coworker that introduced me to salazar 's back in 2005 when it was still in phoenix . found out recently that it was now located in tempe . still as good as i remember it . also , try out the carne asada fries ! ( super fries ) . they are outstanding !
mexican	the quac is fresh and super tasty . the barbacoa tacos are a must especially with a bit of the owners special homemade sauces . growing up eating this stuff , this place is definately as authentic and fresh as it gets . the owner was wonderful and very attentive . this is now my go to place for authentic quesadillas and tacos when visiting az . to compliment the great food and service , the price of it is great . we had a nacho supreme , guac and chips , carne asada quesadilla , carne asada quesadilla platter , carne asada burrito , 3 barbacoa tacos , and 3 horchatas for $ 53 and every single item blew our mind . : - )
mexican	this thing is huge ! the flavors of the meat and the pico de gallo , are so good . consistent and reliable . love it .
mexican	got to stop by and super nice too . simply done with some guac then u put on any fixings like pico de gallo or red onions or picante or salsa verde - it 's all good ! sip down some tamarindo ( no cervaza bummer ) and ur all set
mexican	great service too ! my whole family has liked everything we have gotten from here .
mexican	good prices . good birria . bomb salas . definitely one of our new spots .
mexican	great homemade refried beans . very good service . ok fish tacos . way , way out in sun lakes ...
mexican	i love my late night munchies , this one defeated me though . i just couldn 't finish the monster burrito . the red salsa was much more spicy than i thought it would be .
mexican	would come back to los tacos in a heart beat .
mexican	awesome carne asada tacos and corn on the cob with cheese some lime juice and good ole tapito hot sauce ... oh and margs. all day chillin out on the patio
mexican	we hit this place every time were in town and love it , so try it out for good food at a simple place .
mexican	even though its not the prettiest place or area of town its worth it ! they make everything there and they have fresh toppings for your food .
mexican	really tasty . nice charbroiled steak and fast and friendly service . can 't go wrong . can 't wait to try more .
mexican	some of the best i 've ever had . highly recommend the crazy potato as well . great fast service ! forgot to mention the salsa bar and avocado sauce . a must have .
mexican	awesome carnitas and fresh tortillas. great homemade salsa verde. oh , plus a small portion of the queso fresco gonna be perfect .
mexican	the flavors were delicious . i 'll be back for another round .
mexican	steak , braised beef , chorizo , yams and bread pudding to die ( and wait in line ) for . a real gem . been there twice in past two months and can 't wait to go back .
mexican	awesome ceviche that was fresh and full of good veggies and fish , she had tacos that were also good , great mariachi played requests all night payed by the restaurant and only accepted tips , reasonably priced all around ,
mexican	have tried most on the menu and the fish taco is my go-to with a side of guac and chips : ) great place for a quick bite , very limited seating .
mexican	i was amazed on how good the food was and i can 't wait to go back when i 'm actually drunk and / or hungover . the manager is really cool and their food was really fresh . the salsa was actually spicy and it definitely burned on the way out .
mexican	who knew ? we went a bit out of our way during a day trip ( between visiting red rock canyon and hoover dam ) to check out this place on the recommendation of a friend , and we were not disappointed . the food is nothing fancy , but it 's real , and it 's good . the guac is a highlight - made tableside , fresh and flavorful ( at about half of nyc prices for the same ) . the atmosphere is festive and the service attentive . a ton of locals / regulars is never a bad sign either .
mexican	i buy at least two to three chicken deals when i visit . it still never lasts very long . so good .
mexican	fresh nacho chips with guacamole . ordered small but was very filling . couldn 't finish the whole of quesadilla a lot of quantity . and loved the hot sauce . it 's super spicy . overall nice food !
mexican	try it also with hard shell ! ! taste amazing ! !
mexican	will definitely be back to try their enchiladas and other menu items .
mexican	i prefer them covered in their green sauce . great home made chips and salsa also- though be warned that they do charge for add 'l baskets of chips . great service ! never crowded unfortunately . very casual atmosphere but a step up from quick food as they do wait on you .
mexican	both amazing ! shredded beef taco and a bowl of caldo de res , super amazing . loved it ! ! pair it with your favorite jalisco and you can 't go wrong . first time here but everyone was nice , friendly and clean . what i normally order other places , love it love it love it !
mexican	received a free house margarita , too , for checking in with yelp ( and they don 't chince you on the tequila ) . big , high-def tvs for your sports viewing pleasure .
mexican	salad had delicious dressing and chicken tacos excellent . great value ! ! !
mexican	i ordered the carne asada steak and it was cooked perfectly ! their double cadillac margaritas are amazing !
mexican	i gave them 4 star 's because i havent tried thier chicken . the burrito was a good size , tortilla was thin and not gummy .
mexican	had the chicken chimi and it was great . service staff was excellent too . decor was modern and clean . highly recommend .
mexican	best enchilada suizas . mole yum ! if you love margaritas & sangria try sangrarita ; you won 't be disappointed . oh yeah , good service too !
mexican	gotta love a place that serves breakfast all day . stopped in because of the yelp reviews . if i lived closer i would come back because burritos are my favorite food . too bad : (
mexican	clean as a pin , the decor is wonderful and the food , oh the food ! everything was excellent but the red chile beef was out of this world ! the chips and salsa are warm and fresh but i preferred the ' hot ' salsa . the portions are huge and the price is very reasonable , its a keeper !
mexican	there are too few good sit-down cocktail places in madison . this place really fills that niche for me . food is good too . definitely not for dinner time - the portions are too small , you will spend a fortune trying to get full . but it is a good accompaniment to drinks . mussels with chorizo are good ( very rich sauce , just fyi ) . white anchovies are also very good - my favorite .
mexican	this place serves traditional mexican with an upscale twist . very crowded on most nights . delicious food .
mexican	check out the adorable new location on guadalupe and gilbert . some of.the staff is still.in training but they are so pleasant you won 't mind a bit . very fun and fresh !
mexican	and the yucca mash is to die for , if you love yucca with garlic . like mundungo yummy .
mexican	had breakfast at el cafetal , everything was delicious . i had perico with rice and my husband huevos , chicharron , chorizo , and arepas . the service was fast , friendly and everything clean and welcoming . can 't wait to go back and try the bandeja paisa ! ! !
mexican	ate some delicious steak asado. the empanadas were delicious and the service excellent . the people here are so kind and i am never disappointed . the fried plantains are also amazing . you won 't regret eating here ( if you have an open mind ) .
mexican	staff very pleasant . eaten boyger 's , fries , boyrritos and each time i was happy , full and the bonus is i didn 't have to pay an arm , leg and neck for lunch !
mexican	we travel from northern az for this gem ! ! ! delicious .
mexican	great decor and feeling . its a mim and pop place .. definately going back .. its a must ..
mexican	get the roasted garlic appetizer , and any of the pork dishes . they are excellent . lots of flavor and spices and a great local joint . another favorite place of mine in scottsdale .
mexican	im a out of towner and i was looking for the authentic tamale feel . as a chicagoan its hard to find authentic south western food that is worthy of praise . the chicken green chile and the chipotle chicken are the bomb ! ! they make it in the store and freeze them for you to take home enjoy with the family . the helpings are huge and the customer service is bigger . im definitely a fan of the store if your in the phoenix area its a must eat !
mexican	awesome customer service , easy parking ... manny was super helpful and patient with suggestions and recommendations .... came for the fish tacos .. i 'll be back for the octopus and shrimp .
mexican	everyone is so friendly ! ! bonus points for the girl at the register who noticed my government lanyard in my hand asked me if i was military and was able to save so much $ $ with military discount a + + + ! ! !
mexican	great food authentic and the staff was amazingly nice would highly recommend .
mexican	yes they deserve more than 5 stars . can 't wait to go again !
mexican	awesome customer service , i go to this location specifically for the great employees
mexican	im currently not getting around well do to an injury however when i entered the resteraunt the staff was quick to help . winded from leaving my crutches in the car , i sat down . what usually is a walk up to order establishment quickly accommodated me so i wouldn 't have to get up . i knew they had great food , but i was just completely blown away how much the staff went above and beyond to make my experience yet another great one .
mexican	i will be coming back - not too often but definitely returning ! !
mexican	the cubano sandwich was good . not the best i 've ha but very good . ambience is very desirable and they even had musical numbers .
mexican	.. the employees behind the counter were very attentive and all had smiles on their faces . great location ! !
mexican	the guys working at the bar / kitchen work so hard and fast ! i was amazed at their hustle and food came out delicious . and the margarita drink was just perfect ! would definitely come again
mexican	they are very friendly and help you pick the best foods from the menu haha they keep the lobby very clean . my order was complicated but she was very patient and they got my order correct ! planning to come again very soon ! !
mexican	we got here right after the kitchen closed and we 're super bummed about it . about five minutes later the manger came out and said he would open the kitchen for us . even though they were closing down they didn 't rush us at all . the drinks and food were delicious ! we will definitely be coming here again . and who doesn 't like free chips and salsa ? ! : )
mexican	lucky for us it was not ! we walked down the block looking for something to fill our bellies and this place called me in ! the ladies behind the counter are amazingly friendly , helpful , and wonderful at their craft ! the burrito options are wide open ! pick what you want in there , and they do it ! i got carnitas , beans , cheese , and bacon and included the potatoes inside ! so super yummy ! and the red spicy sauce was great ! ask for 2 ! wish i lived closer so i could try more of the options for lunch ! !
mexican	i highly recommend it ! the place is a hole in the wall but they have a really good happy hour !
mexican	come at least to pick a cool chair to sit in and then enjoy the yummy food . fast , plenty and reasonably priced . i had the chicken tacos ( hard shell tortillas ) . really liked the rice , too .
mexican	the food was very good , not amazing but definitely among the better culinary experiences available in the urbana-champaign area . one caveat is that the portions are rather small .
mexican	food is delicious and a little different than traditional mexican restaurants , more like from mexico city . waiter was super friendly and attentive . get the sangria !
mexican	the pink tacos were delicious . wait staff was so so . it seems like the larger your group , the slower the staff is . a con is that i 'm always cold when i 'm in there .
mexican	very hip and cool little place . walls are covered with cool art and interesting pieces . tacos are amazing . shrimp is probably my fave ! the michelada is super authentic . has the perfect balance of flavors . cool little spot .
mexican	definitely worth your time and money . i have been here two days in a row now . food is great and the drive thru is 24 hours . the service is very nice and courteous .
mexican	delicious , cheap , easy food when you 're having a late night on the strip .
mexican	delicious fresh mexican food . ice cold beer nachos , tacos , fajitas everything was great . service was fast and friendly . they kept the chips and salsa coming which was very nice . classic mexican food and delicious .
mexican	quite a dive in terms of decor , so don 't expect anything fancy . there are folding tables and chairs , if i remember correctly . anyway , i had jade red chicken and emperor 's chicken quesadilla and both were so good . the idea of chinese - latino food sounds odd , but i 'd heard of it before and just never had the chance to try it . they have all sorts of combos , mostly with beans or rice as a side ( get it ? chinese and latin food both usually come with rice .... ! ) . so before you knock it , if you 're in phoenix and looking for a place to eat , this is it !
mexican	would highly recommend the vegetable quesadilla and guacamole along with the pineapple vanilla margarita .
mexican	liked it better than burboun or la hacienda . waiter is very attentive and food was excellent . cooked to perfection and right temperature .
mexican	love the way the girls and guys dress . the food is great especially the carne asada taco 's with their beans yummy ! they have the tall beer that you can only order if there 's 3 of you awesome if there is a group .
mexican	i always use the app and the order is perfect every time . delivered quickly by friendly staff . this is always my go-to for pizza .
mexican	i used to frequent mexico often , so i know good mexican food . trust me , this is the place ! have not had anything i didn 't like here , and i have tasted most of the menu . small place , but well worth it . enjoy !
mexican	food is fresh and delivered on time , drinks are on par . will be back to visit .
mexican	fun place to meet up with good friends and grab some sangria and share tapas or pizza . i have celiac and still found things i could eat .
mexican	awesome drinks great food relaxing and a fun place to be and oh yeah did i mention a good happy hour
mexican	awesome empanadas and the owner is a great guy , they just cooked and catered the city 's restaurant event downtown and they were a hit !
mexican	i wish i would have seen the review about the tamales before i 'd been , else i would have ordered some .
mexican	stellar food . amazing playlist . i enjoyed the baja taco and grilled fish taco ... very tasty and great service .
mexican	tacos are made fresh to order . you get your base , corn tortilla and protein and then you dress them up how you want . i tried one shrimp and one fish to get a baseline . both were awesome ... but i think the shrimp was the victor . make sure you get an order of fries so you can enjoy all the sauces . you absolutely must try mixing the cilantro cream with the chipotle sauce .
mexican	this is worth the mile detour from the interstate . the pastor is the most flavorful i 've ever found in the us . especially excellent for az mexican . enjoy
mexican	everything is delicious and at 99 cents for a taco you can 't go wrong . i need to make it a habit to eat here more often .
mexican	everything is excellent . the burros are burros ..... not burritos . burritos belong to those poor folks that believe taco bell is mexican food . the tacos are mucho bueno and i live for them . not the pathetic street tacos . of course , i was raised in the globe / miami area and may be a little biased .... not ! i know good mexican food and this is it . period .
mexican	exclpt it 's way too small . we need like 20 more of these statewide . la crosse first please
mexican	eric and his wife always willing to serve . had tequeños , empanadas de pabellon , cachapas and cafe con leche .
mexican	i met this amazing guy behind the counter named jorge gave me exceptional service , beyond his kindness and genuine charisma he gave me amazing life advice that led me to later to go a bank of america and open an account . what a stellar guy . great food , great service and jorge . never can get better then el me tate
mexican	juan was our waiter & was excellent . great food , great margaritas , great time !
mexican	love the little window that the host peeks out of , and the secret door . we absolutely loved the food . the waiters and bussers were super friendly . the ambiance was perfect , right down to the little flashlights for the menus . beautiful chandeliers . they had a live ' lounge singer ' that made the experience complete . we will most definitely be going back !
mexican	sat outside , lots of drinks to choose from , delicious fish tacos ! also , we had one of the dips for an appetizer and it was served with warm chips .
mexican	the people are so very nice , and the food is amazing . it is literally the best chicken in charlotte .
mexican	my wife and i got to sit right down and had a very attentive server cameron who was on top of getting us everything we needed . the deep fried ice cream was amazing too ! we will definitely be back to enjoy some more delicious mexican food .
mexican	took my mom here for her 60th- she has a blast ! ! the manager- jen- made damn well sure she 's never forget her 60th or maybe she would ! my aunt won a flipping trip to cancun ! ! awesome place to celebrate . i had the chicken tacos for taco tuesday and they were amazing ! mango margarita yards were 2 for 1 . music was loud but it 's a bar ! what do you expect ! ? our waitress , angie , was a crazy lady ! ! ! but super fun .
mexican	made sure we were fine the whole time . wanna come back .
mexican	their happy hour is really worth it , excellent specials . do not underestimate their fajita quesadilla-delicious ! we would go more often if it wasn 't all the way across town from us .
mexican	i have come here a few times now and am never disappointed with the quality of the food . the restaurant itself is small but very aesthetically pleasing . the paintings and art really bring a vibrant tone to the the dining experience . as for the food the guacamole is amazing . they make it fresh everyday and you can obviously tell . i recently tried the lava cake which was good and a tad spicy . probably made with chili powder . i would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to try fresh mexican cuisine .
mexican	really good chicken tortilla soup . diet dr. pepper with cherries i definitely recommend this place if you are in the area .
mexican	warm chips with an array of dipping options , along with roasted onions and jalapeños . the two person option was enough for three , well worth the wait to come here !
mexican	great salsa and everything is homemade . save room for the sopapillas that come with your meal !
mexican	awesome family owned business , traditional mexican food at an affordable price , service is awesome , i 've been coming here for about 30 years and the same people still work there .
mexican	amazing , fresh & authentic mexican cuisine . we have been " regular 's " for 12 + years ! huevos rancheros is legit ! ! shrimp burrito is another fav ! !
mexican	awesome. family run place. great taste and very cost effective. inside arco ampm. dont miss it
mexican	braddah 's follow the same business model as chipotle , except their proteins , sauces , and starches are way better . since it was my first time visiting , they gave me a taste of all the meats and i decided on a bowl . it had brown rice w / seaweed , black beans , steak , chicken , veggies , 3 salsas , sour cream , cheese , and guac . it tasted so fresh and good . at the end of my meal they gave me some coconut bark to try , it was pretty good , but a little too sweet for me . i 'll definitely come here again when i 'm in las vegas .
mexican	highly recommend . had the menudo . delicious . the food was hot and tasty , with all the sides , limes , hot sauce , onion and cilantro .
mexican	they were finishing up a batch of chicken ( max 2-3 minutes wait ) .... immediately comped me a free drink . very easy access off the oh turnpike . will definitely stop on future road trips .
mexican	everything was fresh and also got everything i asked for . love that everything is organic . convenient & clean location .
mexican	tapas were good- beautiful presentation , and service was spot on . the snapper ceviche could have had a little more , thus the 4 star review , but in all a solid place . will give it another try for sure- and bring your wallet . it is not for the people looking for happy hour or the value menu .
mexican	feels like you are walking into mexico . the food is fantastic .
mexican	awesome find and awesome authentic food. the breakfast burrito was unreal ... tasty not oily. authentic !
mexican	great ambieance . quick lunch . yummy avacado torta . must have been 3 whole avacados ! ! nicest manager . i will be back for dinner . run . don 't walk to mejico ( cafe ) .
mexican	we had the emerald chicken ( my favorite ) , red jade chicken , chile relleno , and machaca . my wife loved the black beans ! atmosphere was laid back and the staff was friendly and made the experience a good one . very inexpensive and would probably be categorized as fast casual . i wish they still had their east valley location !
mexican	we went in for some live music and boutique mexican food. drove halfway across town for this . was not disappointed . bobby our server ... she was fantastic ! the atmosphere was quaint and enjoyable on the patio and we enjoyed the music . upon owner recommendation we shared the empenadas and then the seafood relleno and tilapia . all were fantastic ! 5 stars , we 'll be back again ! ! !
mexican	what a great an authentic colombian place , the hotdogs were flavorful and cheap . i had a natural juice " tomate de árbol " and the original colombian hotdog ! will definitely come back and i highly recommend it .
mexican	the cilantro , chipotle , and creme sauces are on point ! clean , quick , and delicious ! just as good as any fish / shrimp taco on the coast .
mexican	really i don 't know what this location is doing differently from the others but it is soooo much better . maybe it is the obvious love the owner has for the place that makes it taste better i do not know but go there
mexican	fish tacos are amazing . the place is clean and friendly . the food tastes too good to be fast food - however if you 're trying to impress a date , the paper in plastic baskets won 't do it . pack it up and take it somewhere nice and pass it off as more expensive fare . seriously though , this place is great . the chipotle sauce is like crack . i could easily see ending up homeless and toothless for just one more shot of the chipotle ...
mexican	fish tacos are the best in the city . the rest of the food is addictive and healthy . i eat there all of the time . the service is typically great and the place is very clean .
mexican	being from maui and trying them all over the islands , i was very impressed ! clean open atmosphere and friendly staff .
mexican	best i 've had since leaving san diego ! and the service was friendly and fast . i 'll be back !
mexican	) we will be returning for the rest of the menu !
mexican	everything is fresh and flavorful . the fish tacos have a ton of ingredients including fresh fruit . the fish is grilled and it all just comes together in this little magical taco . there 's nothing else to say really . go here , eat tacos , the end .
mexican	i love the salsa / topping bar . i had 1 fish taco , and a mixed fish and shrimp taco . the oil was a little bitter , but not terrible . the tacos were stuffed , and i was way too full to finish the second one . the beans were way too spicy for my liking , but i 'm not a fan of spicy hot foods and definitely wouldn 't order them for my kid . there are a couple kinds of iced tea and a soda fountain . i left full and relaxed . friendly cashiers and cook . i 'll be back .
mexican	not breaded . they have really good black beans plus the option of brown rice . also they have a bar with an excellent view of vegas .
mexican	we also enjoyed the nachos with chicken . the owner was very personable and helpful when ordering , we very much enjoyed our lunch .
mexican	you do not have table service here so you have to be in the mood for the type of place where you order at the counter and then sit at a picnic-table style bench ( with no back ) . however , if you are up for that then you are set . the food is so good . the staff is very friendly too . if you have kids beware small portions . we 've had to get back in line on two occasions because my daughter was still hungry ( hasn 't happened elsewhere ) so now i encourage her not to order off the kids menu .
mexican	terrific friendly service with a feeling that you 're not in pittsburgh for a moment . with mexican music playing and spanish being spoken this place is a display of laid back authenticity at its best .
mexican	the spread of sides is the best i 've seen for a mobile setup . definitely glad i stopped here .
mexican	we went on a saturday around 1 : 00pm and the place was empty but filled up soon afterward . service was prompt . the menu was bigger than expected and sounded pretty authentic . they have a full bar which was a plus as i was in mood for some tequila . i had the smoked marlin tacos and slow cooked pork tacos .. both were incredibly flavorful and excellent . not the best i have ever eaten but darn close and i have had a lot of great tacos in my travels . the only disappointment was i was hoping to also get a chile reano , sadly they don 't offer them . i 'll go back for sure when i am in phoenix .
mexican	1 $ tacos m , tu , w are great , 3 tacos and a carne asada fry is a filling meal for 2 .
mexican	the avocado and chicken arepa ( reina pepiada ) is great , cuban and roman sandwiches are to die for . my only complaint is that 6pm is too early to close , wish you were open later at least one night a week so i could pick up dinner on the way home from work .
mexican	awesome food , a group of 4 of us went in for the first time and they treated us like family .
mexican	a group of our office randomly decided to stop by this place today . don 't let the simple dining room fool you ... the food is complex and is definitely home made 100 % ! i 've never had liberian food , but wow , they do it right ! the guy who sat us , understood that we didn 't have a clue what to order so he brought us a free little sampler of some of their dishes . after a few bites i knew exactly what to get ! potato greens with rice ! they definitely work at a slower pace there so don 't expect a 20 minute lunch ... plan on being there for at least an hour ... 5 stars !
mexican	a little expensive but worth it . the service is awesome and so is the shrimp cocktail . also 2 for 5 $ frosted cold mug beer . thank god they are here because el burito was getting old .
mexican	a little pricy but the food was really great ! definitely will be back . i like how it 's family owned definitely original . i had a carne asada taco and you can tell the difference in meat from when you go to a filibertos .
mexican	i had the smoked chicken enchiladas . good chips and salsa . great grilled veggies . this is our second trip to spring training and second time to los sombreros . we 'll be back for sure .
mexican	the best fresh tortillas in town . better and cheaper than some burro 's but be patient as there is always a line but worth the wait . so glad they opened up a location in the east valley .
mexican	always a sure bet for great mexican food . open late . green chile our awesome ! !
mexican	always look forward to every visit ! gluten free options as well . thank you !
mexican	amazing service , truly talented kitchen : ) and it 's rare for a real mexican restaurant to have quality vegetarian options ! i got a burrito earlier today , best one i 've had in years . we 'll be coming back soon !
mexican	i 'm always happy with service because i know they have only a few people hired . been back many times .
mexican	suggest bandera burrito . subway style so you can choose fillings / toppings .
mexican	our family of 3 ate for $ 30 , and had enough leftovers for another meal . the empanadas were great ; perhaps the best i 've had in a long time . i also liked the chicken and rice , as well as the platter ( wish i could remember the name ) . service was great ; the only weak spot was the paella , which my brother-in-law ordered . it just didn 't taste fresh , but overall , the menu was great , we 'll be back .
mexican	this place has such a great atmosphere . nandos is definitely one of my favorite spots !
mexican	came here for happy hour and it was great . two people chips salsa , tacos , and drinks for $ 16 . give it a try .
mexican	the arepa benny was delicious . i also tried the empanadas and the sliders which were also great . great customer service .
mexican	many margarita flavors and they are very good . there arnt too many texmex places around anymore
mexican	park right around the corner in the garage and have them validate your pass for 2 free hours ! !
mexican	ask for ezekiel and he 'll take great care of you . my boyfriend and i stopped in for a quick lunch and the bar was packed so we opted for a booth . it was really nice that they honored hh at the tables too and not just the bar . we got the hh bean dip , guacamole , corn fritters , and the shrimp tacos . the complimentary salsa was great and super flavorful . everything was great . the margaritas were great and very generous in size . will definitely be back . keep up the great work guys ! !
mexican	arrived 3 min before closing , and when they ran out of what i ordered ( 1 customer ahead of me ) ... the meal was on the house .
mexican	my mom and i had the empanadas and they were terrific ! love the small local feel , amazing atmosphere ! you and your gang have knocked it out of the park jeff !
mexican	we 've been regulars since they were on durango . can 't say i 've tried everything on the menu but the flautas el paso are a staple for me .
mexican	family & i come here at least once a week , more if it was closer to home . we have had most of the items on the menu , my husbands favorites are al pastor tostada , tacos and elote ( corn ) . i stick with the veggie tacos and rice and beans . food is fresh & delicious every time ! can 't wait to go back .
mexican	the atmosphere was amazing and food prep was visible to customers .
mexican	we had the crispy fish tacos and sweet corn . could not have been better . we will be back for happy hour . great atmosphere .
mexican	i drive through vegas all the time and this place is great when i 'm looking for a quick place that is off the strip . service is quick & friendly & the food is tasty
mexican	my wife and started with the casaritas which were perfect ! we ordered the table side guacamole which was prepared by edward who was very friendly and had great customer service skills . the food was great but be warned that the habanero salsa is very , very spicy ... and delicious too ! we had a great time and the price was very fair . we highly recommend this resturant !
mexican	awesome food and great customer service ... you have to try this place ... good mexican food !
mexican	the staff was very friendly and i mean who doesn 't love taco tuesday ? !
mexican	a must eat with authentic mexican food . not the tex mex fast food crap ! ! ! the homemade wine is divine ! the home chocolate ice cream is fabulous and so yummy ! !
mexican	street tacos were excellent ! plus yummy bloody mary 's !
mexican	the chips we 're fresh and loved the salsa , bean dip and grilled jalepenos / onion snack . was full before the food arrived , should have stuck to only one basket of chips . a great value , great quality and quantity . the best mexican restaurant in vegas that i 've been too .
mexican	enrique was great ! the carne aside burrito was delicious and not greasy . had tres leches cake and berries with cream for dessert . both were tasty and not too heavy .
mexican	highly recommend the vegan breakfast burrito . thank you ! !
mexican	i have yet to find good mexican food in cleveland . if this place was in another city it might just be average but since i have been in cleveland for 3 years and had such a lack of mexican food in that time it was amazing . also very clean and large servings .
mexican	i love to try different cuisines and this place has encouraged me to try more cuban food . we had the cuban sampler and the pollo ajjillo . the sampler was awesome . i would give 3 stars for the other dish . you must try the flavored sodas . they are really nice and so different from what sodas we generally drink . for the dessert we tried the flan which wad heavenly .
mexican	i 've recommended ths place to everyone in town . i 've tried the tacos and several burgers , and all were declicious . the sweet potato tots were so good , i got two orders . definitely a place to try .
mexican	salsa was great and so was the chicken enchiladas . the drinks were great . will be coming back for sure .
mexican	the chips and guacamole are delicious ! thanks diane for the positive attitude and taking care of us right away ! will be coming back for the happy hour ! inexpensive drinks but not holding back on the alcohol ! thanks !
mexican	try the green chili enchiladas . service was fast and friendly . great family atmosphere .
mexican	very clean , kids love the food . the salsa bar is very fresh . the morning staff is very nice . food portions are just right .
mexican	tres leches bread pudding was not a normal bread pudding and therefore not very good . other than that very pleased !
mexican	again , it 's vegas so slightly over priced but the staff was quick and friendly and drinks were great . awesome place to eat in the luxor .
mexican	great service ! for under $ 10 you get a baja chicken chimichanga meal with rice and beans . the chimichanga is as big as the plate . you can taste that the beans and rice are homemade . try the churros with vanilla ice cream and a caramel sauce that is out of this world . can 't say enough good about this place .
mexican	hafe when we call a head and tell them no salsa inside our boxed cause we don 't care for the original kind and prefer to get our own . we always get home with like 5-8 salsa we don 't want , makes us feel wasteful ha
mexican	always quick and friendly what more could you want from a lunch place . daily special is great but everything is fresh . even the horchata .
mexican	great mole . all-time favorite . do yourself a favor . eat here . off the strip ... they 'll come and get you !
mexican	i will definitely be back when i 'm in vegas . i had the menudo and my wife had the chilaquiles . the menudo with the homemade tortillas were exactly what i needed .
mexican	john and andrea are great owners / hosts and the staff is great ( thanks brad and ken ) good food ! adovada ribs and stuffed sopapillas rock ! you gotta try it ! we will make this a regular place to eat for sure ! and don 't forget the tequila selection .
mexican	looking forward to coming back ! the taco plate was awesome . tons of flavor and large portions .
mexican	awesome food and service ..... love the family atmosphere , chips and salsa are delicious and the food is fantastic with generous portions .
mexican	lime margaritas were perfect : just the right amount of salt ! ! chips and salsa were delivered and devoured ! ! grande burrito lived up to its name . taking most of it home ! !
mexican	my husband and i came in for a saturday date and couldn 't have been more pleased . we ordered off the create your own taco menu and all 4 came out delicious ! we both had a chicken and a chorizo taco with different toppings . we also had the chorizo quest which was perfect . the waitress was very nice and because the tacos took longer than normal to come out they gave us tortilla chips on the house , which was very nice . i also ordered a beer that had just kicked and they gave me the rest anyways . overall a very pleasant visit and will definitely recommend everyone go to condado .
mexican	very friendly indeed . the fry bread is delicious and so are the refried beans and the cheese enchiladas are awesome too .
mexican	stopped in from out of town . first fry bread experience. was not sure what to expect but ended up loving it . try the verde sauce !
mexican	their shredded beef tacos were delicious . we also had the cheese crisp and it was very good . loved the bean dip they served with the chips and salsa .
mexican	very friendly staff as well . it 's super close to shopping so it 's very convenient to stop at . we will definitely be back !
mexican	we had margaritas , filet nachos and beef chimichanga . a nice respite from the fremont street experience .
mexican	we will be back . i suggest the chimichanga with green sauce ! one of the best i 've had !
mexican	try the red snapper or arroz marinero ( my favorite ) . the arroz is a stirring platter of octopus , shrimp , fish , clams and scallops .. my favorite dish in the valley .
mexican	breakfast or lunch , the burritos are great ! make sure you get a punch card !
mexican	the al pastor taco and the chorizo taco are the best ! the chips are made from flour tortillas and the combination of those and the salsa is so good you have to make sure you don 't over eat before your tacos come . it 's a little spendy but worth it !
mexican	awesome food , and the best staff in the area .... taste the oaxaca cheese , and the tacos ! !
mexican	put a smile on my face that 's for sure
mexican	awesome food , and the staff is incredibly quick while getting your meal together. generous meal sizes. the only down side is seating is very limited and uncomfortable. the place is often busy
mexican	i love supporting family owned places ! the owners do a great job keeping the lines moving and keeping the store very clean even when they are packed . if you are new to phx or just have never been here then give it a try . you will not be disappointed ! ! !
mexican	second time coming here , got different plates and it is all delicious . my 9 year old says this is his new spot for eating out
mexican	the service is usually good , as well , but today , not so much . my soda ran dry ( and sat dry for some time ) and i had to ask to get my salsa bowl refilled ; and then , it still wasn 't enough even though i asked for " lots of salsa . " my server was not as on the ball as the other servers appeared to be . aside from that , the taco and enchilada combination is my go-to order here and was delicious , as always . go anyway ... maybe complain if your server is lax . the food is worth it . four stars for not-so-hot service .
mexican	my wife and i are in love with their chicken tortilla soup ! it is always made fresh with fresh avocados cut on top . the small tacos are also very fresh and non greasy . they are trying to get a license to have margaritas and beer but they are still waiting for that . overall a must check out yourself restaurant !
mexican	ate there about a week ago while traveling . pbj appetizer was great . tacos were excellent . drinks just right . well worth the time . highly recommend .
mexican	we ate in the downstairs bar and loved it . i had the new mexican platter . you should try it soon .
mexican	i 've been here approx 6 times . my favorite is the naked peruvian with chicken and plantains . also love the fried rice and wow lomito
mexican	the guacamole that was made fresh at the table was incredible . the salsa was even better . the fish tacos were great ! loved the outdoor eating area .
mexican	authentic for sure . fresh friendly and affordable . check this place out !
mexican	best hot sauce in town , best mole hands down . wonderful cucumber margaritas . thanks for expanding ! gluten free bread is also a super plus , the papa is a great baker ! all around delicious
mexican	good portions . quick service too ! open late , even on weekdays . our go-to late night burrito joint in toronto .
mexican	awesome workers behind the counter ! ! great clean home made food in a little restaurant with food made fresh when you order it ! ! also awesome falafel ! !
mexican	awesome drinks ! every time we come to vegas we stop here and eat a great meal . the ambiance is great and staff is friendly
mexican	awesome drinks ! staff is very friendly ! ! i stopped in because my car was getting serviced next door and it was a great lunch decision ! i 'll definitely be back !
mexican	this is the only mexican restaurant we go to anymore . we bring our out of guests here and tell everyone . they make us feel like family . the salsa , tortillas and beans are all homemade .
mexican	awesome service as well . we got there and im 5-6 minutes from ordering we had our food . the food tasted amazing and was very well portioned . this is a go to placenif you 're in vegas and want some bomb sea food !
mexican	i was surprised . i 'll be coming back !
mexican	awesome service , bettttttter then burrito express for sure ! give them a try ,
mexican	my wife and i stopped in to kill some time during a layover on the way home yesterday , and to enjoy the airport version of arizona 's version of mexican cuisine . she had an awesome enchilada-style burrito and i had some green chili soft tacos that were really great , washed down by a tecate . aubrey was a great server and her friendliness and attentiveness went a long way to make us feel welcome in the midst of the sea of airport-traveler humanity . will be back the next time i fly through phx .
mexican	they always make extreme accommodations for my dad 's multiple food allergies , and it 's always a fun atmosphere . good drinks too ! prices are good , always able to find affordable food items . fresh , healthy food is hard to find , but taco haus is awesome ! !
mexican	awesome service ! very friendly . got the pork shoulder , will be back to try the next dish .
mexican	awesome service ! will definitely be back for more ! the carne asada is seasoned perfectly ! i had the carne asada on yellow corn tortillas . the tortillas .... omg ! ! ! haven 't had these type of yellow corn tortillas in a while ! must have ! excellent food ! you guys have to try this place . you will not regret it !
mexican	awesome service ! ! ! ! would make the trip from chandler again .
mexican	been looking for a great authentic mexican food and this is it , tucked away in the back of an ampm gas station but well worth going to
mexican	best salsa bar . they need a bigger restaurant to service more customers .
mexican	i 'll be back ! when i saw the portions i thought i 'd take half home but i couldn 't help but eat the whole thing . the chiquilas were on point .
mexican	its pretty decent looking in there and its clean . only negative thing is parking is somewhat complicated . mhmmm steak breakfast burritos : )
mexican	big wap was unbelievable ! it took me a while to find a spot to park my truck tho , parking lit is tiny and its packed !
mexican	brought all my coworkers here the other day for the first time and they loved it too and couldn 't wait to go back !
mexican	takes a very long time to line up just to order your food , and when you want another beer , you gotta line up again which is kinda dumb . gotta fix this : )
mexican	awesome food , came to have dinner with my brothers and sisters at enchiladas de mama , homemade corn tortillas , good chile rellenos , and great service
mexican	sometimes they are crowded and super busy but bring you out a free ceviche tostada to hold you over . great place
mexican	come here if you are an adventurous eater , as they have some not-so-average choices ! hibiscus tacos , corn chowder , and crab and mango salad are only a few of the many delicious items ! our waiter was very caring and descriptive of the food , and we definitely will return ! ! !
mexican	completely loved the stuffed marshala chicken ! excellent new management !
mexican	definitely feels like los pollos hermanos ! try the dulce de leche empanadas !
mexican	def worth the drive . tried the caramelos , larazos and carne asada tacos ... all delish ! will find a way to come back .
mexican	easily one of my top 3 favorite places to eat . i 've tried the bistec and the chicken and they are both great !
mexican	enrique was an awesome waiter and the flan is amazing ! ! ! i had some of the empanadas which were delicious . my friends and i ordered the fried ice cream , flan , and churros and all were really great . the servers were very friendly .
mexican	especially for people who are gluten free we had the cauliflower ( sooooo goood ) , calamari ( amazeballs ) , ceviche ( awesome ) , wings ( perfect smoky flavour ) and the gnocchi ( pretty good ) . panna cotta and plantain dessert were spectacular ! definitely will be back
mexican	everyone in our office loves this place . give the carnitas a rip ! we 've been coming here for over 7 years and haven 't had a single bad meal or poor customer service experience . chile verde and hue is rancheros for lunch do not disappoint . 5 stars , i cannot recommend this place enough ! ! ! ! !
mexican	awesome food everything was so flavorful price was not too bad considering the amount of food that youll be getting and the customer service was amazing.i will be coming back for sure
mexican	everything were ordered from the apps to meals were delicious .
mexican	authentic and tasty & great prices ! we get the burrito bowl & love it !
mexican	great service . best salsa than any place i 've been ! love it !
mexican	place is clean , bathroom clean n cool instrumental music plays to soothe the soul ! food is authentic and classic peruian ! great food !
mexican	loved the laid back family-owned appeal . i only deducted a star for he lack of seating . i hope you guys can score a bigger place because you sincerely deserve it !
mexican	fast and always hot . plus they have a late night menu that is basically already made . nice for a late night meal
mexican	first time here and we will definitely be back for more . came on a saturday afternoon with the kids . ate inside . kids each had great cheese crisps and wife and i had shredded chicken tacos and chorizo enchiladas . everything was great . stayed for some drinks- $ 3 make your own bloody mary 's- and listened to radical 80s tunes ! cheap cheap food and really great atmosphere . we 'll see this place again !
mexican	first time here so i can 't guarantee all the items , but what i tried makes me think the menu is promising . wow . yum . and they have a daily special that 's happy hour prices . not to mention the awesome chips and dip ( mild , hot hot , and spicy bean dip ) that come out as soon as u sit . yum !
mexican	flavors were terrific and the service was pretty good . it took a while for them to seat us even though we had reservations .
mexican	awesome food for a great price so much to chose from had the # 13 2 chilli rellenos w rice and beans only $ 7.59 couldn 't even finish it ... chips are fresh hot and delish ... salsa bar tasty and hot yummy great experience for our first time new place open 24hrs and have a drive though too thanks for the bomb food
mexican	signed up for yelp just to review . i 've had the crazy burrito , pollo con crema , and the arroz con polo . all were very good , but i think the arroz con pollo is my favorite . bed of rice , with grilled chicken mixed with mushrooms , onions and some queso . comes with flour tortilla , chips , and salsa on side. a lot of food . don 't let the location scare you . it 's a small place , and gets quite busy during lunch hour . usually have to wait 15-20 minutes so call ahead for takeout .
mexican	bring your appetite though ! ! ! huge portions but very decent prices . happy hour all day . we had the street tacos with drunken beans . yummy along with the carne asada nachos . oh my god they are huge but the guacamole is so fresh and tasty . brought home the leftover and can 't wait to dive in again . very friendly staff . a little dark inside but they do have a nice patio outside . food was flavorful . can 't wait to try them for breakfast or come back to listen to a band .
mexican	met the owner and he couldn 't have been any nicer . highly recommended ! ! !
mexican	first time there and we had so much fun . got kids ? have balloon hats made for them . this guy is great .
mexican	told the woman making the food we found them on yelp and asked what the process of ordering food was . she walked us through it and told us all about the food and different meats , garnishes , and sauces . everything was super fresh , and very authentic ! had the 5 street tacos all w different meats , ended up going back for more to take home . great place ! however , the water taste kinda bad which made the fountain lemonade taste weird as well , and the coke from the fountain was out of service , so i 'd recommend going w a bottled beverage . otherwise , great stuff !
mexican	friendly staff ! all around great place to eat . highly recommend the burritos .
mexican	the guava pork sandwich was incredible ! will be coming back !
mexican	awesome food friendly staff good prices good environment come check it out if food is awesome the staff is very friendly
mexican	get the green salsa , i don 't like green salsa but i love their green salsa .
mexican	definitely looking forward to going back and trying other options on the menu . the taco salad was loaded with flavor and tons of protein . the perfect combination . can 't wait to go back !
mexican	good service during happy hour . servers attentive . nice size plates . i can eat everything on their happy hour menu if i can . sangria could be better
mexican	got the hatch green chili burrito and red chili pork burrito from food truck taste of new mexico . best burritos i 've had . met chef from taste of new mexico he takes pride in his food very passionate about making his food right . very authentic can 't go wrong venue is very nice , owners went all out to create a very relaxing cool environment . as with any bar opening minor issue will arise but it will all work itself out .
mexican	can 't say enough good about there staff , and location . thank you habanero fresh ! we will be back !
mexican	a must-hit spot for anyone who loves mexican food ! definitely coming back next trip .
mexican	perfect for a casual dinner . like the chipotle of indian restaurants .
mexican	salsa bar is really good . horchata is a must try . very well priced . we will be back .
mexican	they remember my order as i 'm a regular there .. i think that 's awesome and reminiscent of an old ma n pa shop .
mexican	had the fajita special , perfect for two people and very deicious !

mexican	i enjoyed the steak box . homemade fries with steak topped with two eggs . side of hot sauce and salsa . really great vibe in this place
mexican	a gem that isn 't far from the strip ! one of my favorite places to go in lv !
mexican	great portions , and the salsa is perfect if you have tolerance . the burritos are huge , and the meats have been cooked just right in y experiences . as far as service goes , it can be a hit or miss . the same server has been there in a timely manner to take out order , and another time , she did not seem to return for 15 minutes and had to ask another server for assistance . they will disappear after taking your order . 50 / 50 shot of them having orchata . what kind of mexican food place run out of the mexican marquee drink ? ! would return if i 'm in the area with set expectations .
mexican	fresh , made to order right in front of you with several choices . had the taco salad - asked for it to be made without the shell - added fresh avocado instead of the guac . - love it ! glad its also close to waxhaw - need more things down that way .
mexican	truly they make you feel very special dining there . all drinks made fresh , try the mojitos : ) to top it off have a chocolate kiss or a churro , they are outstanding : ) located in town square .
mexican	awesome food , great prices and wonderful staff - especially xochitl - treat yourself to a super culinary experience !
mexican	my husband and i got lunch today : double decker , stuff nacho wrap and a bean burrito . all were so good .
mexican	ceviche was fantastic and enchilada was the highlight of the meal . pineapple empanada was also delightful . going back asap
mexican	awesome food , great service. had so much food , we took some home. i love the interior. small problems like no lids for salsa cups , so coulnd take any home. but an amazing place. the chicken and beef was amazing , even my picky son loved there tacos .
mexican	had the green chili steak enchiladas and they were great . decently priced , especially with the yelp deal ! will be back !
mexican	i had carnitas tacos and my husband had the shrimp fajitas . both were great ! our server was very attentive , got everything correct , and everything came out very quickly . nice , relaxing atmosphere too . our booth was very intimate . i will definitely be back .
mexican	love the guacamole . the lighting outside the restaurant is not so good , so we passed the place twice . once inside , everything we ordered was great ! tacos with mole , el pastor tacos , steak tacos and - did i mention - guacamole ! a must do in phoenix . go now !
mexican	get there early ... they get busy ! i have had fajitas and my wife- chimichungas , but everything looks amazing . i recommend it highly if you 're looking for authentic mexican . prices are reasonable , and the margaritas are excellent . corona lite on tap too !
mexican	the ordering forms were cool and made it easy to customize my tacos . i got one beef and one chicken , and they were delicious ! the tortilla chips were thin , crispy and perfect and i loved the salsa fresca ! also got to try the eggrolls ... amazing ! can 't wait to eat at modern tortilla again !
mexican	the people over there very nice and friendly , defiantly will come back
mexican	glad to see a place that 's going to make it in this spot ! definitely try the margaritas ... ariba ariba
mexican	great tacos , especially for a dollar on tuesday . the salsa bar has everything you want from mild to burn the house down ! nachos and burritos are great as well ! specials almost every day . bottom line , they have taco tuesday on lock !
mexican	great value . a little under staffed on a busy night , but well worth the wait . mahi tacos are awesome .
mexican	great vibes especially when you can sit on the patio . mexican burger is my favorite from the tortas but the tacos are great if you want something a bit lighter . margaritas are good too but strong so beware haha
mexican	hummus was just like in israel and the schug was amazing !
mexican	had " naked chicken burrito .. " pretty good . also good staff and service .
mexican	had the carne a sada burrito with chips and salsa togo , it was delicious !
mexican	had the fish tacos and joe 's crispy tacos . not much for ambiance but you won 't notice once you start eating .
mexican	awesome food , haven 't found something yet that i wouldn 't recommend the staff is always nice and friendly
mexican	( if you like salvadorian food of course ) the employees are nice and helpful and fast on serving , their popusas and ceviche is bomb they give a pretty good amount of food per plate . the price of meals is reasonable and not too pricey either .
mexican	awesome food , homemade chips and bread .. nice interior .. friendly service
mexican	hostesses weren 't very welcoming ... isn 't that their job ? ; ) server was great and had a good knowledge of dishes . tacos were great . will definitely be back .
mexican	i am so glad casa don juan has a location for the henderson area . our server jose quintan was great . outstanding service ! awesome food . taste just like the original location on main st. i will definitely be back ! ! ! ! !
mexican	i don 't know how i could ever eat at chipotle or baja fresh again . got the carne asada and fish tacos and they were delicious .
mexican	i drive from an hour away just for the mangu ! super friendly staff as well !
mexican	if you ever drive down charleston , you have to stop by here ! very authentic and delicious : ) if i wasn 't moving soon i would become a regular ! !
mexican	if you like the spicy side this place is for you . the staff is attentive they are very quick even when under busy times . great music too on friday and weekends .
mexican	if you 're here to order something like a chicken taco or a beef burrito then go away . this place has some incredible seafood ! ! ! the complimentary appetizer served once you sit down is outstanding . the food is very well seasoned and comes in large portions . yes , the prices are leaning towards the high side but i thought it was well worth it . the service we received was good and our waitress was sweet but it was clear that they had other customers who received higher priority than we did . maybe the owners family and friends ?
mexican	i get lamb . my other companions get chicken usually . service is great ! definitely try it .
mexican	awesome food i had the fiesta omelet my wife had the steak n eggs both classic dishes were amazing we will be back definitely
mexican	i had to try after seeing what my friend ordered . she got the trio of chicken soft tacos with crispy slaw . also she got a beef burrito which was a good size . she said both were delicious . their fries were amazing and super fresh . they had a beer batter coating on them which i love ! you can order them with sauce on top but i went with traditional ! check them out ! they are at edgewater live on thursdays !
mexican	i haven 't had mexican food as tasty as the one at this place . oh my goodness ! and the margaritas ? ? ? to die for ! ! ! i live in ontario california and come to las vegas at least 4 times ya ear . this place is on my regular to visit from now on list . great food , good music and great drinks ! christian the waiter was really , really nice and helpful ! and they gave me a rose for mother 's day ! how cool is that ?
mexican	idk it hasn 't picked up yet but then again thats what this sight is for take my word on it and go ...
mexican	im from la , so id like to think i know a thing or two about mexican food and i can honestly say this place is a homerun ! great salsa , fresh tortilla chips , friendly owners and staff .
mexican	i 'm obsessed with the grilled corn side . our server destiny was one of the best i have ever had !
mexican	i 'm partial to new mexico 's style of southwestern / mexican cuisine and carlsbad does it right . just had the enchantment platter , chicken blue corn enchilada with green chile , carne adovada burrito , and a chile relleno with a side of rice & beans and sopapilla . they 'll top it off with the requisite fried egg if you ask too . everything was fantastic , service was great , and the atmosphere is fun . highly recommended !
mexican	i recommend if you go there get the stack with either chicken or steak . it 's really good and the queso they have is to die for . free refills on drinks too .
mexican	food is great and service is top notch . probably one of the best taco places in cleveland .
mexican	i thought everything was really good here .. chips and salsa were great too and service was very good .
mexican	it really does have the mexican taste . fun enviroment nd very friendly staff . recomended .
mexican	i tried a chicken taco , beef taco , and beef burrito and each of them were wonderful . as other reviewers have pointed out , the restaurant itself is pretty run down . the building looks like it should have been condemned years ago . if not for the other reviews of this place and the recommendations of a few locals , i probably would not have dared to try this place if going purely by its looks alone . however , i decided to give it a shot and the food turned out to be delicious !
mexican	its hard to sell me on lengua but totally the ticket . habanero salsa was the cherry on top . ill be returning for sure .
mexican	i 've been here a few times and everything i 've tried had been delicious . i just have two gripes , otherwise i would have given this place 5 stars . the building is run down . it looks like their property manager or owner is slack with getting routine maintenance done on the place . also , the service has been kind of mediocre . one time , i walked up to the window and was put on hold in mid-sentence so the cashier could finish up at the drive-thru . another time , they screwed up my order . oh well . at least the food is awesome .
mexican	i was not disappointed and enjoyed every bite . the atmosphere was great and i 'm a big fan of the chipotle cherry steak tacos ! perfect spot to hang out smash a couple of tacos and have a beer .
mexican	if u don 't mind waiting a bit for your food to be done , this is a must . the pupusas are the beat in town in my opinion .
mexican	i will have to come back , i might increase to 5 stars . service was a bit slow , but the food was incredible . wild mushroom enchiladas and smoked chicken chili rellenos ..... thank you sir may i have another . prices are higher than average , but worth it if you want a outstanding mexican / southwest meal . it has a very modern ambiance and decor . it can get crowded and loud .
mexican	just had a great chile relleno- so smokey and good . husband had tacos and enchilada which were great . house margaritas not too sweet and the flavored ones are slightly tart which is good . highly recommend this place .
mexican	just moved here from socal and have desperately been looking for good mexican food , not texmex crap and this place is great . awesome family owned shop .
mexican	kareoke on the weekends ! cheap and delicious pupusas . i liked the horchata and the chilaquiles too .
mexican	my favorite is the tacu bowl with dark meat chicken !
mexican	love the combo tray . carne asada ... yum !
mexican	love the tacos and it 's nice to have real mexican in brampton . i used to have their food at the farmers market all the time . so happy to have a restaurant to visit .
mexican	awesome food love the their chip and home made salsa it 's free too i can eat that all day they should be charging for that good food i would pay for it tried their chicken and beef tacos cause they are awesome
mexican	love this place . i would recommend you give them a chance . i have been to the one in phoenix and a buddy of mine told me to try tis one out and i was glad i did .
mexican	luis , the owner is just as awesome ! he treats everyone like family ! the chicken nachos are huge ! !
mexican	would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes mex and chinese food .
mexican	variety of sauces was a great adventure in flavor . one of our new favorites !
mexican	the only downside was my margarita was a little on the salty side but other then that everything was awesome !
mexican	my favorite is the bean , rice , and cheese chimi . it 's delicious ! they are a bit pricey , but worth it . they could totally have a great chain if they would expand , but i don 't think it 's ever going to happen . my husband has been going here ( it 's a house , in a neighborhood , with some picnic tables on the side of the house ) since he was a kid growing up in that neighborhood .
mexican	my frozen margarita was delicious as well ! i loved watching the staff- they are very professional , but man do they move around fast ! very hard workers ! we had the flan for dessert and it was probably the best i have ever had .
mexican	nachos and fries were more than enough for two people . bulgolgi beef is tasty . all the ingredients are fresh . the kimchi fried rice is excellent ! i will definitely come back again !
mexican	just don 't be in a hurry to be anywhere !
mexican	carne asada burrito with cheese and make it enchilada style , it 's delicious here ! probably one of the better places when it comes to the breakfast burritos too . this place is a great little hole in the wall stop if you want some great mexican food ! only downfalls , it gets pretty congested in there when it 's busy and the bathrooms are a little neglected . but that won 't stop me from eating here , usually at least once a week for the last two years . keep it up !
mexican	not sure if the guy that is there all the time is the owner but he works his ass off . great food at a gas station is possible
mexican	i 'm looking forward to returning with a large group and utilizing the private dining space by the bar . order the sparkling sangria , it is delish ! !
mexican	owner is great ! he 'll be happy to accommodate dietary restrictions ! i had fantastic veggie fajitas with corn tortillas . yummy !
mexican	paco 's taco is a unique , awesome taste and they have the best chicken tortilla soup that i have ever had !
mexican	piled high food . quick and fast service . i never have had a hard time ordering . i 'm never upset with an order .
mexican	prices are fair for homemade food . i fully support this local business ! had the beans / rice chicken bowl . mmm ! two thumbs up . medium sauce is a perfect blend of flavor and heat . had nice chat with the owner , she is wonderful !
mexican	quality is great i would come back if in vegas . i hope they open some in la . 4 tacos hit the spot and the asad fries loook awesome
mexican	better than the foods we had when we visited puerto rico two months back .
mexican	the portion sizes were large ( i had the quesadilla fajitas ) and it was muy exellento ! we will definitely be coming back !
mexican	by far the best mexican type place ive found . the pollo con crema , chori pollo and pollo fundito are out of this world good . the parrillida mexicana fajitas are delicious and impressive ( i swear , its gotta be pushing 5lb of food ) . on weekends the jumbo margaritas are $ 6 and dos equis pitchers are $ 7 . the margaritas are strong and the pitchers are large ( 64 oz methinks ) . they bring the glasses with the pitcher out half full of beer to make up for any foam . how cool is that ! ? im definitely a fan . seriously , for some yummo cheesy food and great drink specials this place rules .
mexican	we 're from texas and this is the closest we 've ever found to the tex-mex food we love . try the cheese enchiladas - yummy ! ! ! !
mexican	great approachable menu with variety and veggie option . wonderful girl with short hair at the counter described items , offered extras and options and displayed a sense of ownership for the great grub they 're providing . excellent experience , wish i was going to be in phoenix again soon . keep up the awesomeness !
mexican	shared three different plates , and they were all perfectly balanced , seasoned , and cooked .
mexican	slow start on the service but they picked up and were good . the salsa and tortillas were to die for ! delicious mango margarita . really fresh . chicken nachos very good . my son and i had to take doggie bags . big delicious portions . great inexpensive place for the entire family .
mexican	so authentic ! i got el combo & everything tasted good . i was so full but , didn 't feel like stop eating ! !
mexican	so good ! had the asada tacos and the cevichelada ! will definitely be back ! it 's got a great home atmosphere almost like your family in their home !
mexican	the adobada is phenomenal . this place is a must visit in vegas !
mexican	it 's like having grilled brazilian meat slices in a crispy greek-style pita .
mexican	had the tuna , sweet bread , bone marrow and octopus . good ambience too !
mexican	the location on central ave has always been a favorite of mine , now we have one closer to home ! we had the shrimp veracruz and the chicken chimichanga both were great , if you don 't like spicy dishes , and both of these are , they have other great options ! we will be back over and over !
mexican	super authentic . not sure if the health dept visits but clean and good . somewhat of a sketchy neighborhood , shopping plaza and clientele .
mexican	sweet potato tacos are great . nice staff , good prices , delicious food . highly recommended .
mexican	very nice staff & quality food . cleanliness & organized . would definitely come back . the carne tacos are a decent really size as to most restaurants they 're tiny . very good ! !
mexican	not fancy ( picnic tables for seatings ) . good honest food . seems like most of the patrons are spanish speaking .
mexican	the albondigas was superb . loved the chicken picado . as always , 1 flan and 2 coffees for my baby and me .
mexican	the atmosphere is very welcoming and the staff is super friendly . i always get the # 22 plate ... been here many times , and thats what i get every time ( you don 't mess with perfection ) . all of our friends love this place , one of the best places to go in vegas for mexican food , and thats saying something
mexican	the breakfast burritos are of the chain ! i 'm not sure if the guys name is jefe , but he slay those burritos ! ! ! you are definitely getting your money 's worth because one burrito weighs about 3 to 5 lbs . delicious ! i definitely recommend this place . just a heads up , don 't be turned off by the location . it is inside a gas station ; however , there is a park near by where you can go and eat . you won 't regret those burritos !
mexican	the chef and the staff are beyond generous and hospitable ! while every white person in my family ordered variations of the burrito , i went left and ordered carne asada tacos . perfect size , nice spice , and the ingredients were as fresh as possible ! everyone in my party enjoyed the location and decor . shout outs to frank and his mom who takes pics every five minutes . if you want great food , grab a shot and some flautas here !
mexican	awesome food ... the chicken feinstein is outstanding ... tres leches cake and fried ice cream was great ... taquitos awesome ... tequila selection is great ... overall , a gem here in the dessert
mexican	their diablo burrito special is super delicious . nothing fancy , just good ingredients and delicious burrito creations .
mexican	the jerk tilapia is a must ! the staff and environment is wonderful . i definitely recommend it !
mexican	the nachos were very gourd and the chicken burrito with the waffle sweet potatoes were to die for . definitely worth a return trip .
mexican	the place is tiny cantina and doesn 't look like much from the outside . when we visited , a sunday afternoon about two weeks ago , it was packed . the food was incredible , and the wait staff very friendly and courteous . they asked us about our spice preferences and adjusted the heat of the dish accordingly . our tostadas were to die for and i can 't wait to go back .
mexican	mom wanted some pupusas so we drove 20 mins out of our way totally worth it ! will for sure be back and bring friends too . thanks for staying open late on a sunday even tho we were the only ones in the restaurant .
mexican	the quesadillas are soooooooo cheesy and yummy . staff is nice and the store is kept pretty clean ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the conchas are awesome and i can never pass up on it ! i love this mexican market and the sit-in restaurant .
mexican	decoration is nice , mexican draft beer beat that , the music is at the right level and by the way is great
mexican	the service was a little slow . they also short changed us by 25 cents . bummer because the food was so good .
mexican	the staff rocks too ! we hosted a party here ( that was amazing ) and accidentally left a photo behind . we came back a few days later and arturo recognized us and returned the photo . we love this place !
mexican	the wait can be long though you can call ahead and make reservations . our waitress was older mexican woman with a man look on her face . she reminded me of my grandma . the plates are large so .. come hungry or eat left overs the next day . i ordered the tostadas- they were huge and so yummy . the strawberry lemonade was the bomb !
mexican	the wood fired meat is amazing . the sauces they offer to put on them , especially the cilantro sauce , makes it something worth driving to . i recommend it to anyone coming in town to visit , or any local who is lucky enough to be repeat visitors .
mexican	they ain 't stingy with the food serving eaither ! you won 't regret eating here unless you don 't like mexican food
mexican	to say we love it is an under statement ! ! the rices alone are the most flavorful we have ever eaten . chips and salsas are incredible everything is just bursting with amazing flavor . and then there is the flan sweetest richest flan we have ever had ! ! easily the best mexican food we have eaten here in las vegas ! ! we have found our mexican food restaurant . it is really fantastic food ! !
mexican	i tried the birria quesadillas and they were delicious . my only complaint would be the prices but other than this is the perfect place for great mexican food .
mexican	there was lots of tender , diced steak on the tacos and tortas . the torta had an amazing melted cheese crust ! the salsas were a great addition . however , i wish they put a substantial amount of avocado on torta . overall , fernando 's definitely outranks the competing food trucks .
mexican	try the anticuchos ; you won 't be sorry ! they even have peruvian beer and wine . if you haven 't experienced peruvian food , this is a place to try . i love the anticuchos so much that i have trouble trying anything else on the menu , but do often get to taste what others at my table order . the green mussels are wonderful too . if you want a typical peruvian soft drink , try the chicha morada ( there is a hard version , but this will give you a good taste for it ) . please try mi peru -- we need the good , neighborhood restaurants like this to survive !
mexican	try the el pastor tacos ! they are small but worth every cent ! very authentic !
mexican	very authentic , and tastes great ! not too expensive either . however , the area is a bit sketchy . nearly every time i visit i get harassed in the parking lot and asked for money ... i know not the fault of the business but it still prevents me from giving them 5 stars ... i wish i could give them 4.5 stars .
mexican	had great lunch and dinner at this place on the same day ! utilized the drive-through , wait was not long at all . pretty awesome transaction system too .
mexican	very inexpensive and quick service . i highly recommend this as a lunch option if you live , work or are visiting the area . i 'm glad i discovered this place and will be back for sure !
mexican	very nice people . three salsa roja tamales with rice and beans made for a lot of tasty takeout . can 't wait to go back .
mexican	awesome food we are from tucson and stayed the night in the area hands down great homemade food the price was cheap and the customer service was awesome i highly recommend this place to everyone .
mexican	we come here exclusively for these ribeye tacos ! well worth the twenty minute drive on our lunch hour .
mexican	, we had a summer special , " rope vieja " , the cheese corn appetizer and a pork / chorizo arepa . they 're known for the arepa , so don 't skip that , but the special was simply amazing . the cheese corn with bacon gratin is so rich that you 'll need four people . a little sale goes a long way as you 'll have plantain chips to dip into it . we two ordered these three dishes , 2 drinks , total about $ 35 , filled up on less than half , and took the rest home for lunch tomorrow .
mexican	we couldn 't help ourselves . everything is stellar starting with the yummo chips and salsa they set on the table when you sit down . our kids loved it too . we were all fighting for the last bites .
mexican	we 're on our way to get one of the discount steak dinners and saw the superburitto sign and made a quick u-turn . i 've never been happier to eat anywhere . the service here is wonderful we got to try the different meats on the menu . and we 're taking a plate to go after we 're done . if i can get this place 10 stars i would .
mexican	we were visiting vegas from eastern washington and stopped in to try it . food was really good . try the cilantro rice and cilantro soup . best place we ate all weekend . the owner was as great as the food . try it . you won 't be disappointed
mexican	i love the carne adovada - so good i pretty much just get this every time i 'm there .
mexican	staff is very friendly . daily specials are a good value . food is a great american mexican meld .
mexican	waiting time long but worth the wait for great tasting fresh food ! all food is on point ! tortilla fresh made right in front of you .
mexican	wow ! danny m was our server and didn 't d a terrific job . kudos . atmosphere is vibrant , music is a bit loud for conversation .
mexican	you get a lot for the price . i love their carne asada green chile fries and their green chile burrito .
mexican	you must try the fresh - made right at your table guacamole . it is to die for !
mexican	our first time here and we will be back - hoping one opens in the arrowhead area soon . but in the meantime , this location is worth the extra drive !
mexican	been going here almost weekly for five years . the best taco / beer / tequila joint in the se valley .
mexican	if your in vegas this is definitely the place to go ! not to mention the outside view on the strip
mexican	the pastor was mind-blowing and the gorditas are just next level .
mexican	found this place thru a coupon . have returned at least once a week ! service is friendly and fast . love the chicken burritos ; food is always hot and fresh ! beats any other fast taco / burrito place i.e. baja fresh or taco del mar which i use to frequent , now its z-lantro every time !
mexican	the tortas are original combos , and although i chose a basic chicken combo , it was great ! different than the typical southwestern fare found in phoenix ...
mexican	very personable and friendly staff and owner ! guacamole is the best here if u want fresh food definitely try this place out
mexican	great clean place . friendly staff . will definitely be on my short list .
mexican	table side guacamole and gold margaritas are the bomb . be sure to try the mango mousse pie too . delicious !
mexican	barbacoa was wonderfully spiced and very tender . lengua taco was super tender and great beefy flavor . pork burrito , homemade huge tortilla stuffed with shredded pork . the beans are seasoned well and very tasty . overall a wonderful place for super fresh mexican . salsa bar is also amazing , very fresh and great flavors .
mexican	really huge portions - come hungry ... don 't come expecting a ton of ambience - it 's low-key here , just really great non-chain ( errmm ... big burrito , i 'm looking at you right now ) mexican food .
mexican	the best in pittsburgh so far ! it 's like having abuela in the kitchen at home- quality ingredients , much skill , and love that shines through .
mexican	hard to find a parking spot and the line is out the door . had the camparo beans ( pintos with jalapeño and spices ) . so good !
mexican	first time there based on past yelp reviews , and it did not disappoint . they serve a slightly different jerk chicken than what i had envisioned , but it was tasty and i am glad we ordered too much so i can enjoy it for another two days ! thank you and we will be back when we are back in the area !
mexican	friendly staff nice decor and delicious food ! the veggie tacos are the best : ) + not too expensive
mexican	try the fusion tacos . i like the spicy pork or the chicken . they say it 's not fast food but you can still order it on your lunch hour . i 've always gotten great service , i think it 's the owner .
mexican	jose greeted us and made us feel like family . started with appetizer of cheese dip with tortillas . sort of a quesadilla unpacked . both of us had chicken enchiladas plus beef taco . everything is fresh and not ordinary at all : : : salsa awesome ! sangria ... amazing ! when in downtown ... this is the place
mexican	yummmm . the reina pepiada arepa is a must but it 's alll good ! i love the authenticity of the food . very very flavorful . the guava and cheese pastelito is like a delicious toaster-strudel dessert and all the juices are really tasty ! minimal service but they are all very nice . not sure why it took me so long to come back to las arepas ( like a yr ) but it will definitely be a more frequent spot for me !
mexican	food was amazing . very small tapas portions .. i could 've eaten 5 by myself easily lol . i 'll definitely be back !
mexican	california burrito took me home . the tacos had generous portions and were well seasoned . very reasonably priced . only knock is the decor and lack of ac .
mexican	truly great food at a great price . awesome friendly staff !
mexican	better than the rest of the fake mexican food here in vegas . the enchiladas fish tacos chicken salad a d tacos ... just everything ... yum ! staff is always super friendly too . my go to !
mexican	wanna come back soon for burritos and enchilada that table next to us had . full favor experience and go with the works .
mexican	go on a friday or saturday night . not only do yout get delicious traditional mexican fare but also a fun atmosphere !
mexican	great addition to the neighbourhood . james ( the owner ) is so knowledgeable and will ensure that you have a fantastic dining experience . we have already been there twice and will definitely be regulars there . there is nothing else like this in the area . ceviche is off the hook ! ! ! !
mexican	great atmosphere and the food is really tasty ! the menu is very small but the food is always done right . we had the burrito , veggie tacos , and fries . all three were amazing . the servers were super attentive and happy hour drinks are 1 / 2 off ! recently they extended the seating around the corner into the area occupied by a coffee shop and gallery- good move !
mexican	great food and service ! ! cool atmosphere too : ) drinks are strong and delicious . i had the passion fruit rita and it was amazing .
mexican	great food ! great vibe ! great service ! i highly recommend happy hour for $ 1.50 mini tacos . they were all great , especially the shrimp and halibut .
mexican	great food . lil commercial but i 'm still satisfied . me and my sister got the california burritos . just a slight bit different then the ones back home were used to . other than that . a plus
mexican	i forgot what i had but this is our family fav mexican food place around
mexican	great fresh food , cheap , friendly staff . the pickled onions with habanero 's will make your eyes water in the best possible way .
mexican	great scene . cool decor . very interesting tapas menu . deep fried crab claws w / verde aoli and veal / pork meatballs in a chili sauce were the best . the octopus was a bit tough . i 've had better . ceviche was tasty . house mad tortilla chips were very good . staff was friendly , knowledgeable , and attentive .
mexican	great service and incredibly fresh mexican food . you have to try the guacamole and the endless chips .
mexican	great service , their bartenders were fun and friendly . good food , and festive atmosphere . we will definitely be back .

mexican	enchilada salsa verde is a must get . elote is also delicious ! !
mexican	awesome grilled pork tacos , the beef ones are good to , but they can be on the fatty side most times. chicken delicious as well , but to me it doesn 't top the pork. great salsa bar at every moreno 's and awesome service. food always is hot and come out quickly. i love the horchata as well. i come here for a quick pit stop taco craving all the time !
mexican	awesome grilled wings , best salsa and hot sauce , great service at the bar , great food specials for football and hh .
mexican	we live in az and stopped in for dinner when staying at the boulders . i recommend it !
mexican	awesome guacamole - prompt service - great prices - wonderful ambiance ! ! ! ! ! !
mexican	clearly fresh and homemade . delicious carne asada taco . no line , hardly any wait for food . a hidden gem ...
mexican	had their steak cognac and it was killer . great service too .
mexican	we had the chilaquiles and pork ribs in salsa verde , both really good .
mexican	we are from seattle moved here in july visited for the first time last night . sat right away , nice waitress , cheap pitcher ( $ 5 dos equis ) , food came fast , and it was all great !
mexican	and reverse happy hour ! i loved their lobster tacos ... mmmm ... .lobster in a taco yay ! !
mexican	$ 2 street tacos and big margaritas with a corona sticking out is a great way to enjoy a night in tempe ! the atmosphere was great , the weather was nice and the food was great . not sure what else we could ask for ! as a tip make sure to try each of the different tacos as they all had a unique flavor .
mexican	but the staff really makes the difference . it a limited menu but the chicken nacho and the margaritas are 6 bucks . 4 to 6 . my wife asks for a skinny and they always do it for 6 bucks .
mexican	awesome happy hour deal - their house margarita is about $ 2.50 ( i think that 's right ) - a total steal for a pretty tasty margarita , accompanied by some tasty tacos .
mexican	awesome happy hour for drinks and good , cheap food. the bartenders are always awesome and friendly. great if you 're looking for a nice quiet beer. the food is great but i guess latin american food just really isn 't my thing so that 's why i only give it four stars .
mexican	the nachos are delicious ! i highly recommend this place for a nice authentic happy hour !
mexican	great margaritas . all the crujente tacos we had were amazing and the habanero and tomatillo salsa are killer . great happy hour specials too ! taco tuesday staple from now on . morgan was a great server for our first experience ! answered all questions , great at giving us a tour of the menu . she 's a rock star !
mexican	everything you could want in a mexican spot- service isn 't the greatest but everyone is super friendly ! great atmosphere and my son who never eats anything but fries loved the chicken strips ! !
mexican	service was great . food came fast . everything tasted amazing . best salsa i have ever had .
mexican	special 1.99 tacos and 5 $ margaritas with a good pour ! i will def be back since it 's just so quick and convenient . not to mention its in a church ! cool
mexican	they have those huge margaritas with the coronitas in them or even one with a 4 loko ! all of the servers are great and this last time i had danielle and she was so sweet cute and attentive ! ps they have homemade churros that are soooo good !
mexican	pretty much can 't go wrong anything you order ! love the nachos , although if they got hey salsa to go with them that would make them even better . also love the veggie tostadas and empanadas ! blood orange mojito is awesome as well as the chocolate torte ! meals here are amazing too and bring you appetite ! beer selection not so good but awesome sangria , they add cinnamon ! !
mexican	healthier options ! they are fast and if you join their club , they have great deals .
mexican	food was delicious . the employee that helped us was so great . you could tell he was new because the manager seemed to be giving him a hard time , but he was so sweet . i will definitely be going back .
mexican	hole in the wall . don 't expect a five star place , it 's not that . the food and the prices are great ! 7 street taco 's and a couple of beers for what , twelve bucks . and soooooooooo delicious . my girlfriend and i go frequently . birria de chivo ( goat ) taco 's con todos . carne asada . horchata . everything i 've had is delicious . no complaints .

mexican	great price for good size burritos . burritos are delish ! : - )
mexican	great flavor , great quality and the price is right the owners and staff were terrific and made us feel so welcome . they love what they 're doing and it shows in the food . this is just what berea needed !
mexican	awesome homemade mexican this place is a must would i highly recommend the fajitas ! ! !
mexican	food is super underrated if your into the more relaxing environment i 'd suggest going sunday- tuesday , most other days it can get pretty loud and packed
mexican	if you are down town jumping from one joint to another this is a great spot to get a cheap snack if you 're hungry ? my favorite topping was definitely the crumbled potato chips .. absolutely genius , who knew adding potato chips to a hot dog could add so much texture / crunch , flavor and all that jazz . the guy working the stand is pretty quick and friendly . although i was a fan , ryan m. was not but maybe that 's because he 's from jersey ?
mexican	all made and cooked to order . my favourite is the beef , but the pulled pork is great too . the only down side is the size . there is limited seating and so can sometimes find yourself waiting for a seat .
mexican	the complimentary chips are alway nice and warm. delicious ! and their super friendly and quick .
mexican	if you like quality , very flavorful tex-mex you will love this place . margaritas with good ( 100 % agave ) tequila and fresh made mix that 's not from a bottle . blue corn chicken enchiladas were wonderful . carne asada tacos with a little bit of pickled cabbage on top are to die for . if you like run of the mill , cheap mexican food , this is not the place for you . this is the top end .
mexican	i had chicken tacos and my friends the potato with bacon yummy ! rafael es may simpatico y un excellent host !
mexican	i had the fry bread with beans , cheese and chorizo . i will definitely be back . good service and food was excellent !
mexican	i had the vegetarian option and then added beef on top : - ) i also had the lime cane sugar drink . it was delicious ! ! with the salsa and all those veggies on it ... the little arepas must have weighed well over a pound. good food with everything arepas , drink , tip it was about $ 10 well worth it i was full and satisfied ! 1 i have to go back and try more things .. for sure !
mexican	i have a gluten allergy and the employees are so careful . i know it is a pain to switch out and am so grateful that the employees are extremely careful and don 't even act like its a hassle . thank you ! ! !
mexican	i have visited for lunch and dinner . all my experiences have been great . great food great service and they accommodated my picky eater son . thank you ! i love watching the fresh pasta being prepared .
mexican	i love getting red chilli colorado . great prices and quick service . always happy atmosphere . great salsa . burritos are huge and delicious . it is our sunday morning ritual .
mexican	i 'm a huge fan of mexican food and this is the way to do it -- authentic and just plain good . if you like " hole in the wall mexican " this is your place . that said , if you care about atmosphere and decor look elsewhere
mexican	i 'm a mexican food junkie , could eat it every meal . i prefer the traditional mexican food places as opposed to the " street taco " type places . went here last night to get fajitas and it was great . the salsa was some of the best i 've ever had and so were the beans . fajitas were amazing . service was great .
mexican	i 'm from texas , but this little cleveland taco joint shines wherever you put it . thai chili tofu ? incredible . barrio slaw ? phee-nom . barrio secret taco sauce ? the best . and , it 's very veggie friendly ! hot tip : sit at the bar after 9 : 00 pm for 1 / 2 price tacos .
mexican	i needed to find a bite to eat for lunch and this popped up on yelp nearby . glad i found it . large chicken burrito really hit the spot . the lineups are long , and its a bit loud and crowded in there , but i think that comes with being popular ! i 've been told to try the halibut ; that 's up next week .
mexican	i frequent here almost every sunday for a carne asada breakfast burrito . i highly recommend this place ! !
mexican	ingredients are fresh and masterfully marinated all wrapped in homemade tortillas , which by themselves you can build a restaurant around . all this for just a few bucks ! everytime i 'm in chandler i will stop by for at least one breakfast burrito and one carne asada burrito !
mexican	i wanted a taco salad and that 's what i got ! i asked for steak and really couldn 't get anything else due to food restrictions so asked for a lil extra steak and he gave me some . the line was insanely long but it was so quick ! i think i was there for only about 5 minutes before i got to the front . when i got to the front it wasn 't like they were over worked all had a great face on and were all about helping out ! great job !
mexican	and ever since then i am in love . i still want to try other things but i love tacos , ( no cilantro ) i grew up in mexico and these are great tacos
mexican	i don 't know how the food was ( it looks delicious from the photos ) because i 'm in la and i ordered food for my shop crew in las vegas and rami is beyond helpful ! we will definitely order from señor pollo again anytime we 're treating our guys to lunch and i will make it a point to stop in and taste the food for myself next time i 'm in vegas ! thank you very much for your great service !
mexican	i tried at taste of madison , best food ! gluten free options allows me to enjoy a few carbs lol
mexican	it 's definitely a hole in the wall type place and could be over looked but so glad i tried this place out . the chips were amazing ! the salsa , all three types had a lot of flavor . i personally loved the green salsa . i ordered the fried taco . it was taste , so much flavor and came put fresh . the service was amazing , quick , friendly and nice . i would absolutely go back to this place .
mexican	i usually get 2 full tacos and split the fries with my wife . i recommend this place to everyone who likes tacos and seafood .
mexican	guacamole made fresh , blackened chicken , moist , fresh & spicy - just right
mexican	i 've tried the chile relleno , fish tacos , green chile chicken burrito and the giant breakfast burritos . i love the sauce . the green sauce is hot and just like i like it . they even have pancakes for my toddler . the staff is always so nice . i highly recommend this place especially if you crave good mexican food .
mexican	i went there for a simple burrito and they gave me some chips and dip as a bonus ..... without asking ! the food is good .
mexican	your interior wasn 't what we are used to for a tapas restaurant but if you can get down with the hip vibe this will be your favorite place . the menu options are carefully considered and the food is beyond exceptional . we tried the olives ( best we have ever had ) , calamari fries , mushroom tacos ( phenomenal ) , serrano and manchego crostini .... and crab cakes . we will definitely be back to try the other menu options and have another el diablo !
mexican	joe dee took me here , for great justice .
mexican	great street tacos and hot sauce . i love the bottled jarritos too . try the breakfast burritos . my fav : bacon , eggs , cheese , and beans . sweet murals too , especially the new dia de los muertos one . i love that i live so close !
mexican	extremely friendly and willing staff that takes care of you . food is outstanding ! we had the ribeye tacos , the carnitas tacos , and the battered shrimp tacos , along with a pulled pork quesadilla to share . find this great little spot and enjoy .
mexican	tasty food . however . there is one warning i have to give and kinda why i only did 4 stars ... the jalapeños are hot ! now i like spicy , i like a kick , this straight up ruined my burger . my whole face was on fire . it ended up to be a little costly but we did have 2 burgers , 2 fries , 2 tacos and a small and large horchata . $ 37 . if you 're looking for a tasty burger that 's against the norm . definitely check them out .
mexican	jose , the manager is an expert bartender who really cares about this place . they lean more toward authentic style fare - sauces , etc than your standard ameri-mex restaurants . fridays and saturdays there 's dance from 10p to 2am - i haven 't gone yet but tonight sounds good ! food is consistently good and pretty quick even during the lunch rush which is quite a rush , drinks are affordable and well made , beer is just right . survey says - definitely go here !
mexican	i only tried the spicy pork because the lines were a little nuts and i want to try something else .
mexican	awesome just awesome deals all around with fresh ingredients and amazomg deals what more can you ask for. i love it here and obsessed with it thank you chipotle for everything just a great place good vibes and food
mexican	would like to let the owners know that they need to check their mexican soda inventory because some of it seemed flat on our last visit . but no need to remove stars , keep the food coming !
mexican	just like chipolte but better 6 different marinated meats grandma julia was here . working away . try her own recipe colorado style beef
mexican	just like the one in fort collins , co ! way better than chipotle and better priced too ! really good , not crowded and the burritos are way way better than the other burrito places in town . only thing that sucks is parking if your not an asu student , which i am not ... thank god ! ! ! love it .
mexican	it 's hard to find good mexican out here but found a place that uses a lot mexican food with awesome pickled and spicy korean flavor . super affordable . bring your stretchy sweat pants ...
mexican	man do there employees work there asses off ! i had god knows what i can 't remember , but the scenary hellow right outside the l.v sign. nice trees , plus you see people taking pics on the sign . it 's crowded , but the atmosphere is up in arms . just tuff to get a place to sit. and there is a mall across the street so yup . the taste was so off the hook !
mexican	tortilla chips and toppings on their nachos were terrific . staff was friendly , atmosphere was really comfortable and modern with a rustic feel .
mexican	legit new mexico food . fresh and tasty . great service . loved it . the stacked enchiladas were terrific .
mexican	there aren 't many down to earth taco joints in to ! wish this place was a smudge bigger ! only has about 6 stools to eat in , more like a takeout place ! taco shells seems homemade ! nice and thick enough so the filling doesn 't leak out causing a messy , yet thin enough to hold everything together ! their fish is nice and crispy yet batterless ! can 't wait to come back to try it all ! come early , things get sold out quick ! everything seems to be made from scratch !
mexican	also had the carne asada and chicken tacos which were also good but pork was my favorite . the kids got the cheese crisp with the works it was huge and really good ! hubby got tacos too and liked them ! ! we will be back . i really liked the lemonade and all the different flavors : ) and the service was great too ! everyone working there was really friendly ! !
mexican	try it . you won 't regret it ! . very authentic place , good service .
mexican	good tapas and great service . in the same parking lot as la quinta !
mexican	stopped by here two nights in a row for a frozen mango margarita . delicious , well priced & excellent customer service ! can 't wait to return !
mexican	fresh food , made with love . best bean & cheese burritos , cheese quesadillas & so much more . friendly staff too . the line can be long at times & their parking lot only holds about 5 cars but that seriously just adds to the charm of the place . also , i love that i can get freshly made mexican pastries ! love ! love ! love !
mexican	awesome little hole-in-the-wall taco burrito mexican food always good there eat their at least 3 to 4 times a month carne asada by the pound tortillas fixings come home make your own awesome deal
mexican	it 's pretty cheap and there burritos are huge and yummy ! had the chicken burrito , have so many topping options check it out if your in the area ! !
mexican	my food was amazing and my " blue lagoon " margarita was delicious . the staff are all friendly and my waiter was very sweet and very attentive tonight . highly recommend , if you wanna grab a bite and a drink with some friends . : )
mexican	like the first review said , lots of authentic mexican grocery . burritos are 5 bucks , i had the beef and chicken during separate times and both were pretty authentic . extremely friendly people . this is my new go to burrito spot . fyi , no seating , take out only .
mexican	super fast service , strong margeritas , creamy guac . perfect place for a quick afternoon lunch .
mexican	small only about 8 tables but great food great service and great pricing ! ! this is a must go ! ! if you love mexican go here and try it out , you won 't be disappointed at all !
mexican	been searching for a great place to get a breakfast burrito . stopped in a got a ham burrito and was not disappointed . great prices and good food . will go back to try california carne asada .
mexican	great food and friendly service . we had chicken and steak - both we terrific .
mexican	the smoked chipotle was great . had three tacos which were delicious . one shrimp one kung pow shrimp and pulled pork . recommend the place . service was awesome as well ! !
mexican	pricy for college kids but a great treat once in a while , and they give you a few chips on the side which is a lovely touch
mexican	salsas are really good , and if the salsas are good , the food is good . we had a huge order because we were in town for a baseball tournament and needless to say we have a big family .
mexican	presentation was fantastic and the happy party in my mouth was even better . the pork carnitas are to die for !
mexican	the fish tacos and appetizers are outstanding ! the service is excellent too .
mexican	the tacos are to die for as well as the chips and salsa . the service was fast albeit a little weird where you order at the counter then your food is brought out to you . i loved the tamale so very much , one of the best in the city hands down . the only thing i didn 't like was the beans , they were just too bland and soupy for me . i would definitely visit again and again .
mexican	definitely worth the visit for sure . had the chicken pepito and it was awesome . will be coming back for sure !
mexican	i had the fish taco combo ( 2 tacos , fries , and a drink ) . the portions were large especially for the price . i would highly recommend giving them a try ! they were amazing . the cashier / waiter was crazy helpful and friendly as well . i will definitely come back to this place
mexican	nice quiet location . try the arepa and the tacos , great authentic tastes .
mexican	definitely go for the homemade tortilla option on the tacos . i had a chorizo taco and the torta milanesa . the torta was huge with plenty of ingredients . salsas are all delicious . service was excellent ! our server spoke great english so if you are a gringo like me then don 't be concerned ... just go in and grab a seat . order some tacos and pay at the counter when you leave .
mexican	their dishes never disappoint and the servers are always awesome . we 've been going for years . their salsa is amazing , and made fresh daily . fair prices and great food !
mexican	these guys have also catered several events and parties for me and everyone is always impressed with the street tacos !
mexican	great , authentic mexican food and cool environment . lots of options and a friendly , helpful staff . don 't miss this one .
mexican	huge portions and yummy food . love that they mix corn and flour tortilla chips . was slightly disappointed that there were no taco tuesday specials but the did have a few drink specials . overall yummy , average priced date night spot . would definition go back .
mexican	try one of their signature burritos . my recommendation is the puerto loco .
mexican	a nice chipotle-style ordering system with tons of options for meat eaters , vegetarians and even those with gluten issues . a great deal , kind customer service and wonderful cuisine .
mexican	food and service were equally amazing . you have to try this place .
mexican	the staff here is fantastic . have been there for years and are very friendly . julio 's is a long time classic .
mexican	service was most excellent and the ambiance at the restaurant perfect for a night out . the best for last - the food is iconic . really well put together menu selection and the chef in the bam delivers quality fresh indian food as opposed to the oily dishes most places serve . highly recommend urban turban for their traditional yet modern indian cuisine .
mexican	huge fan of the mad mex at penn state , and this is reminding me a lot about it . there is an amazing garage type door that opens the front to make the restaurant more of an outside area , and i 've been told by several people that there may be an even larger outside area they are working on for the roof . if someone could confirm this , that would be awesome . anyway the food is great , the margaritas rock and i can 't wait to go back .
mexican	awesome location love the lay out we were there today with the family and order taker were very friendly and prompt .
mexican	loved firefly and can 't wait to go back ! ! tried a several dishes and enjoyed a sparkling sangaria . my wife had a mojito tha twas also very good . i wish we saved room for some of the desserts . service was excellant and the food came out very quickly on a very busy night , which i 'm sure most of them are ! here are some of the items we had : tuna peppers roasted baby beet salad tuna tartare roasted eggplant cannelloni mushroom tart firefly fries crispy duck rolls . the duck rolls were my favorite and the fries .. wow

mexican	it 's been a go-to place for me since it opened - silvana and her teams consistently deliver top quality food and ambiance . cochinita pibil !
mexican	we sampled several of the tacos . delicious and flavorful . we both loved the salsa !
mexican	food is really good . service is just as good . the chimichanga is gigantic . one of the best places in that area .

mexican	customer service was excellent ! ordered the stand taco delicious ! ! will be back for more : )
mexican	love the tacos , rice and beans , carne asada- it 's all good ! yummy horchata !
mexican	the lunch specials are massive portions that include both a drink and dessert - sopapillas . the food is so flavorful . you can tell it 's quality ingredients . with lunch you lunch you also get chips with 4 different salsas ! really quite a deal . the customer service is always great here .
mexican	i ordered tacos--they were super-inexpensive and tasty . service was fast . they took over from roz ... did a great job . highly recommend .
mexican	they have a very cool bar downtown cleveland . you order tacos any way you want . they are large and 2-3 will fill you up , with the great queso and guacamole . try the garlic shrimp , with the mango salsa . definitely a great casual restaurant / bar !
mexican	went there couple nights ago with a buddy who also loves tacos . i will go back for sure , maybe even later today !
mexican	we love it . why is macayo 's busy when there is ajo al.s down the road . macayo 's is worse than taco bell .. wake up people ..
mexican	pulled pork was great also . the steak tacos are on the dry side and needed a trip to the salsa bar for some more flavor ! they have a kid menu for the little ones too . great place !
mexican	this place is legit . negatives : small and dark inside- parking can be tricky . overall great food and atmosphere , so will definitely be back ! !
mexican	had a blast , great food and guacamole with chips and salsa ! !
mexican	like the back patio or bar seating . tortilla soup and carne asada best !
mexican	lonnie the bartender provided excellent service as well , highly recommended ! !
mexican	awesome chips and salsa . great cantina atmosphere . highly recommend .
mexican	awesome service ! loved the shrimp ceviche , chayo burrito with green sauce , gorditas and guacamole ! we will definitely be back !
mexican	i went with a large group while vacationing , and were seated immediately. little wait for our food , and never refilled our tortilla chips , but overall very good. great for vegetarians .
mexican	good tequila selection . menu is awesome ! their restaurant week menu was so great . i am gluten free and it is so refreshing to see a place label their normal menu with gf options ! ! made my day ! ! ! also have had the fish tacos . amazing ! i wish verde was closer to my house ! regardless i will be back ! gluten free people- the staff knows their stuff and i had no problems with the food .
mexican	one and only one knocks you out ! the food was decent but the margaritas were the best . we were there for new year 's eve dinner and the service was great , they were not busy and the server brought us new year 's hats and horns . can 't wait to return again to get our drank on ...
mexican	we tried 1800 on rocks , as well as the mango and banana frozen . good sized and tasty . food was good ... tried enchiladas verde , quesadillas & tequila lime chicken . good spot to grab a quick preflight drink & bite to eat .
mexican	really cute space and location ! not charrito 's by a long shot but a nice alternative away from home .
mexican	the food are a little pricey but very good and we like the fast service . live music during dinner is great and enjoyable .
mexican	fajita quesadilla was amazing . great sized portions , chips and salsa also good . will definitely be coming again
mexican	there tacos are amazing ! great service ! ! they are very friendly and reasonably priced . the atmosphere is awesome and vibrant !
mexican	they have a cool af scorpion tank.they also have scorpion shots-which is cool . very gourmet nachos- but also other food like enchiladas and burritos if you 're not into nachos . awesome good stuff- the shrimp nachos are the best .
mexican	attentive friendly service . ask for maria , she is so sweet ! beautiful murals , relaxed yet fun atmosphere - you have to try it ! ! ! !
mexican	i was raving about that the entire meal . and i think i was a fan of the margaritas . i really couldn 't remember or drive home .
mexican	most of my buddies got the ribs , which are wicked spicy . they were sweating ! their ribs are already off the bone so i guess that speaks to how tender they are . i like milder food and found the tender pork ( carnitas ) delicious ! it was the rice that was spicy ! great food . go there for birthdays ! they have a great way to celebrate ! also kick-ass margaritas are really kick ass ! pitchers all around !
mexican	ha ha ! make your taste buds happy and eat here ! !
mexican	awesome menudo , both red and white , and you can even get it buffet style ( all you can eat ) great customer service , don 't remember her name , but while i was there , she made sure chips and salsa bar was stocked and fresh and clean , menudo bar clean and fresh , will definitely come back !
mexican	great atmosphere ! the chips and salsa is delicious . mexican bowl rocks ! dolly is an amazing bartender !
mexican	the guacamole is creamy and delicious , and their salsa and chips ( free - dropped off at our table within seconds of us being seated ) are spot on . the mole ranchero sauce has a great spice to it , and the pork dishes are great ( slow cooked , fall apart awesome pork ) . we want to try the desserts next time but we are always full after the big-portioned entrees !
mexican	great food , good size portions , and fast , excellent service . we 've never had to wait for a table , but there are always customers . i love the team approach to the table service ; our glasses were never empty , and someone passes by every few minutes to check on you ! along with the burritos , enchiladas , and cheese sauce . . . the traditional sangria is also a favorite ! very highly recommended !
mexican	service was a little inattentive but generally ok . had no problems communicating with the staff as noted by others . i loved their decor , especially the large booth we were seated in . i had the fajitas texicana or something of that nature and the caso con pollo . both were flavorful and the chicken elements of the dishes were moist and tender . portions were very adequate also . what i 'd like to see improved is the cleanliness of their restrooms . it was horrible . a food establishment should police their restrooms like hawks . i 'd return if i was ever in the area again . it 's definitely a solid 7 out of 10 .
mexican	" most of the customers were hispanic , which tells you this food is good and most likely authentic . the fish tacos were flavorful , fresh and delicious . lots of options and many not typically found in chain mexican , such as lengua ( tongue ) and cabeza ( head ) meat options .
mexican	everything tastes fresh and when you taste and see the avocado in the guacamole you know it is the real deal . what moved this review to five stars is the staff . they took the time to explain the menu . i even has an opportunity to speak with the owner who demonstrated pride in offering quality at reasonable prices . i live in the east-end but will make the effort to come back whenever i 'm in the wychwood ' hood !
mexican	love the chips and salsa ! also , had a really good experience with the catering they offer . been going there for years ,
mexican	been coming here for a little over a month now and haven 't had a bad thing yet . carne asada nachos are the bomb .
mexican	can 't say enough about carolina 's . i was visiting phoenix and stumbled upon this restaurant . a gold mine !
mexican	chilaquiles , shrimp ceviche , tortas , and all of the tacos were delicious . oh , and their tomatillo salsa was awesome . i didn 't care for their horchata , it lack flavor .
mexican	fabulous service and really cool atmosphere ! ! best margaritas in las vegas !
mexican	awesome mexican food , fast service at drive in or sit in and eat ... try the new fish tacos , they 're great , and authentic , too .
mexican	if u want authentic this is the place . too many berto this and berto that has clouded the taste buds of az residents . if you want ur mouth to have a fiesta then try the tacos with any if their homemade salsas ! !
mexican	i 'm from the midwest , and i love authentic mexican ! this place is always a must stop and eat ! ! my husband lives the el tico !
mexican	it was open for 40 years before the landlord made them move and now they are finally back . check out the breakfast burrito with potato . doesn 't get much better . not as fast as other mexican places but it 's easily worth the wait .
mexican	awesome mexican food i will be back portions are huge the pond is quaint overall love the place my only complaint is cave creek is a bit of a hike .
mexican	love , love , love their carne asada nachos- i have to get them every time . and the blood orange margarita compliments them perfectly . my favorite part is finding a table outside and listening to some live music in the container park .
mexican	my wife and i were really spoiled by all the good mexican food while we lived in texas and we were pretty disappointed with the selection of mexican restaurants when we moved to champaign , until today !
mexican	my wife is from southern california and proclaimed them to have the best refried beans that she has had . only downsides are the parking lot and it is very loud .
mexican	food has an amazing mesquite flavor and the fuego taco has a nice kick too ! drive up from tempe just to eat here
mexican	this place is quality over quantity ! ... get in line , the vibe here keeps this place hopping ! enjoy .
mexican	the atmosphere is great and the servers are super funny ! it was a great first experience and the tequila drinks are delicious !
mexican	the chilequillas and chicharones are amazing ! very low key ambiance and this place can get packed . wait list up to 30 minutes are very common . pick your times carefully here . worth the wait .
mexican	went to lindo michoacan on a trip to las vegas last week . started with guacamole , then got the al pastor taco plate . delicious and authentic , i would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good mexican food in las vegas .
mexican	would recommend tortas and fish quesidilla for sure . the place is small though , so taking out parcel is suggested .
mexican	haven 't found a better place in the east valley yet . lots of mormons for some reason . does anyone know why that is ? nita complaint simply an observation .
mexican	i absolutely love the casual atmosphere and i always order the cheese enchiladas ( they actually use real cheese ) . they serve hatch brand products which is top notch . you know it 's good when you see more mexican americans than caucasian americans ! not ritzy , but that 's what gives it its charm . check it out !
mexican	the mahi mahi tacos were so good with the small tortillas . the tacos look tiny but were really filling . the fries are also a nice side to share . the yellow sauce that comes with the fries is really good and has a nice kick to it . loved the decor and vibe . didn 't try any of their margaritas but they looked delicious .
mexican	great place to grab some authentic mexican . don 't expect the service to be quick .
mexican	we tried fresh tortillas right after they came out of the tortilla machine . so fresh and tasty ! just ask--the staff was very friendly and also provided samples of freshly made guacamole .
mexican	we are thrilled to have this place so near to our new home ! we will be regulars . the southwestern chopped salad with shrimp was amazingly good . not something i 'd expect from a mexican place !
mexican	what a find . been coming to scottsdale to visit family for 15 years . this is the best mexican restaurant that we have found . high quality , fresh , chef prepared mexican dishes beautifully presented . you can tell these guys really care about the food . family owned and run , the hospitality is wonderful . great service . beautiful interior design decor . casual and comfortable but feeling of high quality and authentic mexican . we are so glad we found this place . we will be back on every trip to scottsdale .
mexican	very legit . menu is in spanish but all the workers were very helpful even if you don 't know what to get . it 's all good anyway , so even if you are not sure what to get you will like it .
mexican	they also have free chips and salsa , and amazing guacamole ! be sure to try the huitlacoche quesadilla . it looks weird , but trust me you 'll love it ! viva huitlacoche ! !
mexican	while not expected given the format , drop in a tip and you can tell they really appreciate it . they have an excellent salsa bar , and sell a wide variety of mexican beer , and it 's priced sooo right . i 'll be back for sure next time i 'm in phoenix .
mexican	awesome , miss the old location on the strip , gotta drive a bit longer but we 'll worth it
mexican	i had the queen arepa , the pork empanada and the equadorian tamale . all the food was fantastic . i am definitely going to be ordering some tamales and empanadas for the holidays .
mexican	recommend to me by my very favorite hotel concierge angelica . wonderful food . not just because of the large portions but because the food is spectacular . i had the verde pork with the homemade tortillas beans and rice . enough for two meals by the way . great place for lunch or dinner if you are a true foodie ! ! !
mexican	) great beer selections and decent cocktails as well made us happy . they have both create-your-own tacos as well as some specials and suggested taco combos . tacos were good - filling - and i loved that you could add what you wanted though it can be a bit overwhelming to have so many options , and a bit confusing for your first visit . i recommend sticking with their tacos that they have created - those came out a bit better than the ones we tried to create ourselves .
mexican	must have all the small plates , they are amazing . didn 't really want to post , want to share this gem for myself .
mexican	good service and friendly staff ! ! had the texmex burrito and it was delicious ! ! i highly recommend this restaurant ! ! ric and the gang were terrific an he also has some awesome tattoos ! ! check it out while visiting vegas ! !
mexican	service was fast and polite . the bottomless chips were amazing . i had american tacos and they were delicious . all 8 of us got something different and not a single negative comment . even our non mexican food eater got really decent burger . we will definitely eat here again .
mexican	will make this a regular stop when in vegas . quick service and great cheesey nachos .
mexican	they have great tacos and the chicken tastes great and fresh ! the hot sauce they have here is what really puts them over the top bursting with flavor and spice , highly recommend the hard shell chicken tacos !
mexican	shrimp empanadas - 5 stars everything else was awesome and 4 stars . carnitas tacos oysters dressed with ceviche whole fish , fried . big fan .
mexican	awesome neighborhood place - fresh food cooked to order while u wait
mexican	when i walked in , i was warmly greeted and i proceeded to order their chilean influenced tacos with pork . it was filled with pork , avocados , tomatoes , and all the other ingredients you would expect to find in an authentic chilean completo sandwich . each of the tacos was stuffed with ingredients . bonus points for staff who know a lot of the patrons who come in by name , and creates a sense of community . coady street should be proud to have completo as its neighbour .
mexican	i don 't need to rewrite all the rave reviews all over again , you can see them below . just try it !
mexican	always tasty , exquisite ingredients those burritos are awesome . if your hungry and want something that taste really good just go there ! you won 't be disappointed by the size because there is plenty of food and flavor enjoy !
mexican	excellent latin food . had mofongos and empanadillas . to my surprise for a college eatery , food was very well prepared and very tasty . great presentation , too . staff was very friendly and accommodating . will be back again to try their other entrees .
mexican	a must try if you have not been . i ordered an amazing burrito last time i was there . flavor was amazing . we have ordered several different items and all have been very good . we were not impressed by any of the shrimp dishes , but all the meat we have tried had great flavor . i didn 't drink but they do have 150 different tequilas , i am sure that is dangerous !
mexican	great atmosphere , great food with no hiding from spicieness .
mexican	ambience was great , service was excellent and food loaded with flavor !
mexican	genuine mexican food that 's wallet friendly and has delivery , including amazon prime ! worth at least a try , and made me come back several times ! great service too !
mexican	as soon as i walked in the aroma from the kitchen heightened my expectations . i was not disappointed . had the dominicano sandwich ; the serving of meat was so generous i had trouble finishing . luckily i had their sangria to help wash it down . the sangria , like the food , tasted delicious ! warm and welcoming atmosphere with a very friendly staff . also their kitchen only uses olive oil , no cheap canola oil here . great food , great drinks , great portions and a friendly , low key atmosphere . can 't wait to be back !
mexican	yummy margaritas made by a very friendly pablo and fresh , delicious , real mexican food ! my new favorite place in town !

mexican	the retro feel in this mexican restaurant was super unique . patio seating with a fireplace is always an added bonus in az . the margaritas were exceptional . we had the traditional poke appetizer , good for a couple people . for dinner we tried the braised pineapple pork bowl and the shrimp tacos . outstanding ! they have a nice selection of homemade salsa / dressings to try with your meals , too . really enjoyed this place and will definitely be back soon !
mexican	we came with a big group and they couldn 't have been nicer . tried to make a reservation a few times before we got in , but there were some issues with the reservation system . the manager came over and apologized for the error and we were seated within 30-45 minutes of our initial reservation . they also provided complimentary queso and salsas which was appreciated ! the tacos were fabulous . the spicy margarita was awesome . we also loved the queso and guac . the chips were very salty , but that may be our only complaint . fun new spot !
mexican	maya was our server , she was amazing . great service , amazing food . we ordered the trio , carne asada , quest fundido which were incredible . also highly recommend the pozole and relleno . the atmosphere is perfect for a social night out . will definitely be back !

mexican	one of those " who woulda thunk it was so great " by the outside . it 's very small and inconspicuous , but i frequent saxby 's coffee enough that i 'm in the area . one clue was that this place fills up at lunch . i mean , it gets busy . and for good reason . i went right for their special which was grilled chicken fajitas with rice and beans . it was great . the chicken was perfect , seasoned with herbs and lemon . everything tasted fresh , as promised . what a fantastic discovery . i 'll definitely be visiting again .
mexican	on saturday , get there as early as possible , put your name down on the list and walk over to the farmer 's market for a quick look around and you 'll be back in time to get your table ... food 's great , service is quick and the prices are reasonable ... love this place !

mexican	passing through checking yelp for dinner @ 6 : 30pm on a saturday night and so many places were closed or closing by 7 pm good thing cause then i found # mariscosplayahermosa directions off i-10 had us questioning the neighborhood , but it was fine ... this place was busy ! so i knew i had found a gem ! the wall was covered with awards , and newspaper article reviews ! the food , service and atmosphere was great ! i wish i was in the area more often ... highly recommend this restaurant ! the molcajete was super !

mexican	the friday night music was great & very authentic & relaxing . a definite plus was that the decor made us feel like we were on vacation .. in mexico , which is more than one can say for many mexican restaurants in to ! we were very happy with our food ( good portions , well cooked ) .

mexican	the meat actually had some flavor to it the salsas tasted like they weren 't out of a bottle not spicy at all unfortunately but the have jalapenos . we got a fish burrito and 2 pig burritos the fish is not the best but went well with the burrito . the pig is tender still has flavor very well done . they also have a pineapple green sauce that well id eat on anything . the meat is a little light so get the second portion . going back soon got more things to try from this place and the kids portions are 3 and change and i am eating my boys leftovers right now .
mexican	ambiance is super cozy with live music playing . food was bursting with flavor .
mexican	super friendly employees as well . great food highly recommend .

mexican	best mexican i 've had in the gta and quite cheap . very friendly and welcoming service ; as the sign says " mi casa es su casa . " the two fish taco meal is very popular and comes on a large plate with generous portions of rice , salsa , salad and guacamole .
mexican	can 't think of a negative . my wife and i both had the fish taco platter . we also had the onion rings and i had the fish chowder . chowder was solid , or 's were some of the best we ever had , and the tacos were amazing . fish was fresh , the white corn tortillas are delicious ( and didn 't break apart-- a bonus ) , and the mango salsa is phenomenal . we will be back ... and back ... and back ...

mexican	awesome place .. delicious food .. great customer service .. reasonable prices .. love the adam 's burrito ^ ^

mexican	awesome place ... everything was clean , good size portions , and quality ingredients. love phat phranks
mexican	every time i go to this place service is excellent . the food is always fast , fresh , and the portion sizes are more the adequate . the have a large menu and there is something for everyone . the also serve alcohol . bottom line this in my opinion is one of the best mexican restaurants in akron area . you will not be disappointed if you visit el meson .

mexican	food is wonderful the service was great . the one thing i loved is how clean everything is . keep up the good work .
mexican	great food ! great service ! honestly can 't ask for much more from a genuine couple who run the place ! all i know is i 'm deeply in trouble because the churros are the best in town . like wow .
mexican	order the shrimp cocktail , super fresh with good size shrimp . we ordered chicken , pork , cheese tamales . the masa is great , light & flavorful . if you want authentic mexican food , try this place . clean , well lit and good atmosphere .
mexican	had the chicken with the taco and enchilada was great , the staff is great , friendly , the ambience is welcoming , a must check out .
mexican	sauces richly flavored very thoughtfully prepared . chips thin crispy , carnitas tender and delicious , coconut flan with pineapple incredible . queso overflowing the plate . best part of the wonderful meal was the service from ernesto . if you go you must ask for him ! head to the border !
mexican	servings are very generous and tasty . jerk pork was a bit bland but some hot sauce does the job ! will be my new regular spot !
mexican	kids meal is the best value around . great tasting food and atmosphere .
mexican	more authentic than chipotle ( and not as crazy busy either ! ) very friendly & helpful staff to explain the different options . best part ... it 's delicious ! ! !
mexican	the fillings of the tacos were flavourful and the portion was just enough .. my favourite was their bulgogi taco . their guac is really tasty ! the salsa bar is also a great idea - my favourite is their pineapple salsa . the place can get quite crowded on a saturday night - we wandered the restaurant for about 10-15 minutes to find some seats - so i 'd suggest finding some seats before ordering your food .
mexican	great prices , too ! enjoyed several visits on my week in vegas .
mexican	i felt like the tacos were a little overpriced but they were definitely worth the very long wait . it 's a very packed restaurant .
mexican	grilled with real hardwood onsite . when you see the smoke coming out of the stack you get what you smell . very small and intimate only a handful of seats but worth the trouble . tastes were heavenly with caramelized onions and fresh crusty breads . the gentleman at the counter works the room like a carnival barker but takes great care of the orders . great prices and fairly good selection of meaty delights .
mexican	awesome place ... found this by accident and love it dearly ... asada burrito no lettuce add cilantro and onion ... just like back home .....
mexican	had the chile verde , rice and beans , one of the best chile verde dishes i 've ever eaten . my bro asked our server cecilia if the had vegetarian and she tells us they can do anything vegetarian his meal was awesome too , cheese enchiladas , black beans and rice . she was awesome too ! ! if your in northern end of vegas off the 95 you have to stop her
mexican	forget about the negative reviews this place is awesome . i am glad i have chosen to eat here

mexican	great food , awesome customer service , good drink selection , and the best tortillas ! ! family friendly with a great atmosphere : )
mexican	i 've had a bunch of their tacos , all very good choices , especially the pastor and crispy fish . margaritas are also very good , especially for the long happy hours on saturday afternoon when they are only $ 5 . the place can fill up but service is usually pretty quick , kitchen 's been fast every time i 've been there . definitely recommend .
mexican	makes for a great place to meet friends and relax . great guac and the tacos are worth the drive .
mexican	great food , good prices . excellent service . if you go you must try camarones a la diabla . this dish is amazing ! ! ! ! they have authentic mexican beers as well as aguas frescas such as jamaica , orchata , and piña . their fried ice cream is the best ! you must try it ! if you like good mexican food this is the place to go !
mexican	i will definitely be back . try to carnitas burrito if you happen to come by . bartenders are awesome !
mexican	the atmosphere is nice and they play nice music looks like an upscale chipotle
mexican	great food - i usually get the taco rice combo , served with beans and a side salsa . but i 've had the burrito as well which was super . really good vibe and very cool decor . the owners - carlos and fernando - are super friendly as are the rest of the staff .
mexican	i passed this place a few times on my way to chipotle and was amazed at the delicious ( and healthy ) looking meals and it has become a regular staple for me . this is not a fast food place so expect to wait about 5-10 minutes for food depending what you order . a lot of the menu is very health conscious but it 's all absolutely delicious and it 's all under or around 10 bucks . between this and luna , i barely need to cook anymore : ) any time i have friends visit and they want to try something other than the usual chipotle / jimmy johns , this place never disappoints ! check it out .
mexican	try the carnitas torta it rocks ! great happy hour , mexican beer for $ 2 11-7 every day ! love this place . everyone is so friendly .

mexican	great margaritas . delicious rib eye tacos and the mariachi is worth coming back to visit
mexican	they have an awesome happy hour from 3-6 . the food was great . my wife got the shrimp rilleno and it was awesome . i got the carne asada steak . i liked the beans and rice as well . the flavor is more true to authentic mexican food . definitely will be coming back .
mexican	the bartender , oscar , always makes us feel welcome and at home . best margaritas and chicken chillequilles in charlotte ! perfect place to unwind after work : )
mexican	don 't pass it up if you are in phoenix !
mexican	if you come try the kiwi margarita it 's to die for .
mexican	great service . great food . we had the spicy guac , tilapia ceviche , amazing stew dish , fish tacos , coffees and chocolate flan . loved every second of it . also , charles is an amazing manager with stunning good looks . ladies , get ready !
mexican	can 't wait to come back and try dessert ! only thing is my boyfriend tried the chorizo one of his favorite but he mentioned they didn 't have much taste ... other than that everything was excellent !
mexican	great tacos , in 2 visits i have tried like half the menu . never wait more than 15 minutes so far . hostess always seem rude though , but servers are very friendly and that counts more . like everyone says , guac and carne asada are amazing . drinks are awesome too , love their bloody mary .
mexican	great tasting food at great prices . will definitely recommend this place . this is the only place i have had that tastes just like my moms ! try the pernil with yellow rice . the flan is also to die for !
mexican	growing up in miami , i took eating arepas for granted since they were all over with street vendors , in costco , and some restaurants . since moving to la years ago , this was my first west coast experience while visiting vegas and loved it . they 're so much better than the plain cheese ones i used to get growing up . there 's a lot of vegetarian flavor options and yummy side dishes to add . the staff was cracking up at my excitement seeing the menu and was really great helping my friends choose what to eat . i 'm adding this place to my regular stops when i visit vegas every few months . : )
mexican	had mango iced tea which was super refreshing and fettuccine na primavera with chicken which was super awesome
mexican	had the polo asada and the bistec . both were really good but the bistec was fantastic ! chips and salsa was also solid . definitely would recommend getting a reservation . we lucked out , walked up when they cancelled someone else 's reservation & got seated outside right away .
mexican	the service was great , the variety of fountains drink selections was nice ... ( they had different flavors available then the normal ones we usually see ) we got our food right away , before you sit down as it 's made hot and fresh right in front of your eyes .
mexican	i come here all the time . some of the best rellenos in town . i always get salad instead of rice and beans and the cilantro dressing is to die for . rice and beans are good too , i just try to eat lower carb . i also enjoy the huevos rancheros christmas style and the sizzling enchiladas , which are served on top of fajita vegetables with guacamole , sour cream , and pico de gallo . most of their portions are big enough to share . they also have a decent selection of draft beers and high-end tequila . highly recommended !
mexican	dollar tacos & margaritas that actually aren 't bad at all . prefect if you 're staying at bally 's -- if you 're losing at craps save you 're last $ 4 and grab a couple tacos and a modelo at 3 am .
mexican	i loved their food ... i wish i had gone there sooner . i would pass this place all of the time .... then , one day i decided to go before i left montreal . man , i so regretted that i didn 't come here sooner ... very good place to eat , and have some drinks as you relax from your hectic work day . i recommend this place very much ! ! !
mexican	the margaritas are great , service is great i love this place !
mexican	im gonna be visiting this place more often . reminds me of home .
mexican	awesome place i 'm going to make reservations today for saturday for my girlfriend and i ... can 't wait ! ! !
mexican	i never write reviews but this place is worth the effort . the salsa was amazing and i didn 't even eat the other three types that came with the meal . great service ! inexpensive ! great staff ! clearance clean ! everything was fresh ! you have to try this !
mexican	in town for a friends wedding and patrick the manager and staff were great ! went there 4 days in a row and had a blast ! ! ! ! !
mexican	i reserved a private space for about 45 people to celebrate my grandma 's 88th birthday . it was great ! no extra charge for the reservation and private area ! ! food was delicious as always . my family enjoyed everything . we went on a saturday at 7pm ; they had a live mariachi who sang " las mananitas . " i also took a cake and they placed it in their fridge until we were ready to cut it . great experience ! !
mexican	awesome- place is great- feels like cabo the drinks and food are also great and priced well
mexican	awesome place , its crescent thats all that needs to be said .. everyone needs to go there at least once , food , music , drinks with great atmosphere what else could you ask for
mexican	just driving through from texas and very impressed . clean , bright environment , the food runner who i believe is a manager is very kind and attentive , and the food is great ! i had the taco trio , my wife had a quesadilla on corn , and brother had a burrito and we all really enjoyed the food ! the guac and salsa are great too ! a lot of taco places i leave feeling kinda bad , but not at all this time . food is well worth the price and i will come here again next time i 'm in town .
mexican	just heard about it 's re-opening on facebook and had to check it out ! when i arrived i noticed that i wasn 't the only one who must have heard about them re-opening . the place was packed ! it was well worth the wait . the service and staff were very friendly and prompt . had the crab relleno and was loving every bite of it . their bean dip and green salsa is also awesome ! was so impressed with the food that night i went back 2 days later to indulge again . will definitely be coming here often .
mexican	just today we eat there . very reasonable price ! ! ! lots of food you get . always have box up . salsa homade chips . great service . we go there every chance we can when in town from maricopa az . judy jenkins and james mitchell
mexican	loved the look of the place and the atmosphere , it is a little cold inside but , nothing one of their good variety of beer cant fix , also prices per taco are a little high but makes up in flavor and exotic flavors . i guess i 'm trying to say it is the perfect place if you are looking for something different in pittsburgh .
mexican	manager brought out logan a free corn dog and the tacos were great . i 'd go with the turmeric chicken my wife got but crunchy fish was good as well . we 'll be back when we 're in the area .
mexican	meat was tender we order the asada plater . beans were delicious salsa was awesome ! staff was great and helpful and friendly ! ! my son eat the quesadilla and it was not greasy . better than pepes tacos .
mexican	the meat is cooked on charcoal ehich is very awesome in my opinion . very distinctive authentic taste .
mexican	found this place on yelp & wanted to venture off to try something fun & different , not the usual strip food . service was friendly , food was tasty & unique . started off with some chips & salsa , good salsa , nice and spicy ! i had veggie tacos with kimchi , delish ! my hubby had the burrito with kimchi and the beef , very big burrito ! really enjoyed this place , would go back , and cheap !
mexican	only the slightest bit sketch , but i took that as a good sign . with the help of the friendly cashier i was able to decide on a breakfast burrito which was very good . the tortilla had a really great texture and flavor and the ingredients seemed fresh . can 't wait to try some of their other burritos and some of those cookies . i think they 're called wedding cookies , i regret not get any .
mexican	ordered the carne asada tacos and were some of the best i 've had , great flavor . the carnitas were killer too , with a nice little crunch how i like it . manny is a great host . can 't wait to explore the menu further .
mexican	our waitress was amazing and very friendly . the fried beef taco is out of this world . nice beer selection as well . we will be going back ! !
mexican	awesome place para la cruda ...... good mariscos and if you head over during the weekend mariachi and trio playing ... you have to try the michilada and the mojara .... all in all fast service / nice atmosphere / good food .....
mexican	patio is great . the owners are really nice and helpful . just a good family owned restaurant and the food is amazing .
mexican	service was spectacular , food was authentic and delectable . went in for my first time ever on my birthday today , they brought me and my friend free desert ! definitely will be back !
mexican	small . great , inexpensive food . you should go !
mexican	staff is friendly and helpful . the place itself is cool looking and they keep it clean . i had the pork tacos ( 3 to an order ) and they were delicious ! interesting spin on mexican food--tastes fresh and is not overly filling . will definitely be going back !
mexican	my only two issues are the soda fountain being in the back ( and they aren 't always up front to refill your cup ) and the various salsas aren 't that great. you also have to ask for napkins cause they keep them in the back. the cook was friendly and this place is very cheap ! !
mexican	street corn and chicken enchiladas were great ! highly recommend this place .
mexican	super friendly and the food 's great ! those who get seats are super lucky ... but even if you can 't get a seat , the food still tastes amazing . definitely earns it 's 5 stars !
mexican	the food and drinks are delicious and the staff is friendly : ) definitely will return ! they have courtesy valet fri night be sure to bring cash to tip the guys ! !
mexican	the food and drinks were great . the staff was very friendly and helpful when selecting things on the menu . as an out of towner , it was really nice to stumble in on a place where it seems they have a regular clientele and know what they 're doing to accommodate their patrons . if i 'm ever in town again , i will definitely return .
mexican	i also tried the carne asada burrito and it was great .
mexican	the manager was really friendly and so was the drive-through person taking my order . the food was great ! it would 've gotten five stars except the drive-through guy that gave me the food seemed new and he forgot to put a straw in my bag . i only noticed it after i drove away .
mexican	the owner is right there making your food for you . family owned place . original food , he smokes or cooks the food with mesquite wood so the meat has good taste to it . i try to go there a couple times a month
mexican	the staff was very nice . the bar and ambiance are great . the food was very good . the service is almost too fast . i was just starting to enjoy the chips and boom , the tacos showed up . three tacos is a meal . a side is included . local vegetables was good .
mexican	the taco very authentic for what you will find in mexico . i stopped her for lunch on sunday . not crowded . very clean . i had the fish tacos . they were excellent . crunchy and tender inside . you can top it with anything they have like cilantro onion cremation etc . i also had 3 small tacos : barbacoa , green chilli chicken and carna asada . the barbacoa was my favorite . deep flavor and med heat . the others were great also .. can 't wait to return with my wife !
mexican	the tortillas are actually made with lard , so they are top notch . the carne asada was lean and the taquitos were extra crunchy . all at an affordable $ 5.99 . the only downside was the price for drinks . $ 2.50 for a large soda with no free refill . overall , very , very good .
mexican	awesome place , they keep it very clean , the food was too good for words , they are cleaning nonstop , wow what a place !
mexican	they have numerous varieties such as columbian , guatemalan , spinach etc etc ... i am spoiled from buying any other sausage , once you have tried this . this place is a little bit pricey , but i have no problem paying a little extra for these !
mexican	they have a pain killer and a maui margarita which are our favorite . the price in everything is perfect nothing out of budget . the food had been tasteful and presentable . will be coming back and trying new food
mexican	( chicken with green salsa are my fav : d ) . of all those 11 years i 've been there , the chips are always warm . ( their chips are soo addicting ! ! ) . the staff are very friendly and are gladly available for your assist . if you you still have room for dessert don 't hesitate to order their epic fried ice cream ( my grandmother can 't get of that sh ! t lol ) .this restaurant can also be a really good place to hold a reservation or party . ohhhh and there 's free wifi ! ! overall , tamales doña maria is a great place to take the family out for a mexican restaurant .
mexican	food is really good . i had the tinga chicken nachos and my friends had the chipotle chicken burrito . both were outstanding . their chips and salsa are so good because the salsa is fire roasted . if you want a great drink try the el pepin . def coming back when i have a chance
mexican	birthday celebration was topped by a shot of tequila . great service and hospitality .
mexican	everything is delicious and is great value . highly recommend it . hot sauce is great . tacos and pupusas were awesome .
mexican	great customer service and atmosphere . i will definitely come back . i used a groupon and was worth it .
mexican	great food , i like mild salsa and theirs is just right for me . they do offer hot sauce for those more daring individuals . the service is always good but i received excellent service from mariella ! ! ! even though i was dining alone she didn 't ignore me and was very attentive . my drink and chips were never empty ! !
mexican	i come here regularly on my lunch break in the service is always friendly i recommend asking them to ' mix it up ' for you once your burro is done they mix it all up before wrapping it : )
mexican	our server enrique was perfect just like the food ! the shrimp burrito was made to perfection and i would highly recommend it ! enrique was a definite highlight though . we just got into town and his attitude was very welcoming as a first stop ! thank you again ! make sure you take advantage of the flan check-in ! you won 't be disappointed !
mexican	gets busy during lunch time but if the weather is nice you can always sit outside . staff is friendly and you don 't have to wait too long for them to bring you your food . overall good place to eat
mexican	mario is the employee there . when ever we go there we try to get his section . food is awesome . i swear i gain 5 lbs when we leave .
mexican	service was great ! food was excellent . best mexican restaurant i have been to in a very long time . will most definatly be going back .
mexican	the decor is unique just like the craft tacos they 're serving up . the location in regards to parking can be a bit hectic during the lunch hours so i usually just find a spot in the neighborhood next door . great service , great food , and great atmosphere = me returning for more and for you to go for it because you won 't regret it !
mexican	we always come here when we are really hungry for fast service , polite staff and good food . this has been our favorite mexican food restaurant for 14 years .
mexican	awesome place to get a kick-ass burrito , being a huge eater a large burrito fills me right up. awesome qualitity , awesome servings , awesome price , awesome flavors i recommend the shrimp everytime , the fish combo 's are good as well the hot sauce is actually hot , try not to put too much on. my only complaint is the guac ... its consistency is not always on par .
mexican	the burgers are cooked to order , which makes it well worth the wait . the chicken tacos are awesome as well , despite the fact i do not like cilantro all that much . the fries are good , and the lemonade is simply fantastic . the cheery employees helps set this place apart from any other . they really make you feel welcome and appreciated . the stand is also very well organized and clean . a very good indicator that the staff take pride in their job . i will be back , that 's for sure !
mexican	the service is great not see it as a business i see it like me going to a friend 's store if that makes senses lol
mexican	very good drinks . there are specials everynight . the tacos are great , try the oyster taco . ceviche is always good . prices are very reasonable . if you haven 't been here you should go . i will be back again .
mexican	they have a huge selection of meats ( don 't worry , you are allowed to sample ) along with an assortment of toppings and a salsa bar . prices are solid , not too expensive , for the portions .
mexican	loud atmosphere and a unique surrounding . i like all the christmas lights and the painted ceiling . we ordered the vegan and veggie nachos . the vegan nachos were ok but my friends loved the veggie nachos . service is pretty quick . portion sizes are huge ! i can 't imagine one person eating an order of nachos . great place for those with vegan , vegetarian , meat eating or gluten free people . one star off because the bathrooms needed a bit of cleaning . no , the graffiti didn 't bother me , the soaking wet floors and lack of napkins did .
mexican	live music , great service and spectacular food ! ! !
mexican	situated between the strip and fremont st. , this huge restaurant is one of my favorite places to eat in vegas . i love their margaritas , the streak is always tasty , i love their bean dip and chips and sauces and salsa . the staff is attentive and patient ( i come with my 95 year old uncle ) really great place to eat ! plenty of handicap an street parking .
mexican	casual friendly enjoyable restaurant and food is delicious ! this is like my 3rd time here i keep forgetting to leave my yelp review ! thumbs up !
mexican	i was slightly overwhelmed when i walked in because of the cafeteria style line , but next one will be prepared . i had the muleta , vampiro , street corn , and chips and guac and they were all excellent ! i was surprised by the format in this building because i had been to republics which it was previously . it ended up being a great change of pace and the food was great . a fun group outing as well .
mexican	there is a humbleness about the atmosphere that makes this place very relaxing , the food is phenomenal. grilled beef heart , ceviche , potato stuffed with beef and fried , it doesn 't get better .
mexican	we had six different plates and no complaints from anyone . excellent service , waitress ( mercedes ) made friends with our two year old , she was awesome . ate the alambra , it was heavenly ! a nice place to chill over lunch in the heart of the city !
mexican	we had the green chille burros and they were perfect ! give this place a try !
mexican	we picked this spot because it was only a block from our airbnb , in an up-and-coming area known as the art district . tacos huevos fits that mold perfectly : cool vibe , friendly and fast service , and incredible food . the tacos can be a bit messy ( not a bad thing ) , but you can get a burrito or a bowl if you don 't want to soil your threads . 10 / 10 would go back !
mexican	we purchased a groupon that gave us $ 60 to spend on either lunch or dinner . i would recommend going with people ( we had 4 people in our party ) and going before 5 pm for lunch. the lunch menu is much bigger and much cheaper than the dinner menu . we ordered 10 dishes and were only $ 3 over the limit ! super fresh food . service was a bit unfriendly but it was pretty good timing wise . be sure to order the mango shrimp tacos !
mexican	we were headed to binks but it was packed so we walked across the street to mejico . had the chili verde and my hubby had the carne asada . very delish . i won 't lie the salsa is hot but i love it like that . yum ! ! we will back !
mexican	i 'm obsessed with the vegan nachos . i 've had their black bean flautas , sweet potato enchiladas , most of the vegan taco options , and a vegan chimi style burrito and have loved them all . however , the vegan nachos are still my favorite menu item . very rich ... i once refused to eat them until my waitress came back because i was convinced the creamy sauce on them was dairy . ( it wasn 't . ) the prairie fire margarita is delicious , and very spicy . and the staff are always super nice !
mexican	reminds me of chi-chi 's . also the price for lunch is really good . dinner prices are alittle high but good food for the money .
mexican	great bar area with a huge selection ! they have a very large patio seating area , but it was drizzling when i visited so wound up waiting a half hour to get seated . it 's probably wise to make a reservation for this place . the food was great . we had stuffed quesadillas for appetizers that were absolutely delicious ! the complimentary cheese tortillas when we were seated were also quite the treat ! i had the fish tacos , which were also fantastic . it was a bit expensive , but it was worth it . highly recommended .
mexican	if you are over on this side of town do not hesitate coming here ! the homemade tortillas are delicious ! i had 4 tacos 2 asada 1 lengua and 1 shrimp . the shrimp was probably my favorite ! it was fried which is different than most of the shrimp tacos i have had in the past . but they had fresh ingredients and the food came out piping hot ! i can 't say enough about the service ! they were great ! i would definitely come back here !
mexican	worth trying to see if it 's your style . great service and food . reasonably priced . no complaints
mexican	great location , outdoor seating . only bad thing is the noise level can go very high in the dining area downstairs . very good place for a date . the food is the most important thing in any restaurant , and this place has great food . the waiter service is excellent . they make you feel welcome and comfortable and always happy to help . i will recommend this place highly to anyone who wants to have a nice evening and mexican food .
mexican	, olivia is a fabulous waitress the happy hours terrific great appetizers three dollar margaritas i would highly recommend it yelp seems to think that i 'm not saying enough but take my word it 's a great place
mexican	portions are good ! service has always been good ! bam this and the one on indian bend and greyhawk are on point . avoid shea and 92nd
mexican	make sure to order s side of bread for dipping into this amazing pozole juice ! if you can 't handle the heat don 't use the hot sauce , if you are a champ go ham on the hot sauce ! 4 stars bishes !
mexican	i was pleasantly surprised that the pozole was so similar to my mother in law 's own recipe . yum yummmmmm yummmmmm ! good pork , lots of hominy , and served with lettuce / cilantro / onions to mix in.the bowl was a great deal for $ 6 . i 've also had my fair share of tacos on taco tuesday and i have zero complaints there ! my personal fave is the carnitas tacos .
mexican	the best part about this place is the restaurant inside . the only way to get better homemade mexican food is to have your very own nana named rosa ! i recommend the carnitas street tacos ! it 's also pretty cool watching them make chicharones , as long as you 're not vegan that is . if you visit , you must get a drink called plantano that they sell next to the bakery
mexican	i loved the decor as well . most importantly the tacos are delicious . definitely check it out if you 're in the downtown pittsburgh area .
mexican	very authentic ! nothing tex mex going on here ! ! ! servers were very polite , music was good , tables were clean ! i would recommend it to anyone and the menus were in english as well !
mexican	pros service was unbeatable ! super friendly ! food was great with good portions . prices are fairly inexpensive . cons a lot of decor on the wall overall awesome experience !
mexican	i had the red beans and rice ( arroz con pollo ) tostones and the flan . all were excellent and the garlic sauce is highly reccomended . definitely will be back to gorge .
mexican	the staff is friendly and the cooks are always working . it 's not fast food , so don 't expect to be in an out within the hour . as fresh as it gets .
mexican	friendly people . great prices . hard to notice from the street but worth stopping in .
mexican	i think at el pulgarcito they have more filling in them , on average , compared to other places i 've been . the menu here is pretty extensive - definitely more than a pupuseria . i had two pupusas for lunch , and my bill came to $ 5.09 ! what a deal ! !
mexican	i was getting home sick and looked up salvadorian restaurants and found this treasure ( i 'm not from arizona ) ... the ensalada ( fruit juice with pieces of fruit in it was awesome and the pupusas were so good ! ! so glad i stoped by ! we were greeted by nice people ! great food and great service .
mexican	tasty and cheese was just oozing out of em . got the pork and cheese pupusas . inexpensive and fulfilling . will definitely be coming back .
mexican	been coming since the 90s . still best burritos and quesadillas in town . nomnom
mexican	they are more like empanadas than quesidillas but they are so good . try the mahi mahi , it was so fresh and the sause was wonderful. the salsa bar will show you a dozen different salsas . really fun to try them all .
mexican	the salsas are amazing . love the little burro collection . perfect for picking up food for ball games .
mexican	the only huge negative is the line for ordering the most popular items have one guy handling all orders besides that great food
mexican	awesome red chili great little local place with good food and decent service. if you go , make sure you try the cheese crisp ... awesome !
mexican	we had the cheese platter , tuna cones , yellow tail , and rib eye dish and they were all delicious !
mexican	beautiful ambiance . today i had the special : a beef burrito with green verde sauce . delicious ! ! the best part of the experience was our waiter , rashaad ( aka superman : ) . he was so friendly and positive . made our lunch a great experience ! ! !
mexican	5 star ! im always greeted with a smile ! super nice manager and staff ! thank you very much !
mexican	huge , fresh tasty burritos with top quality ingredients . great vibe at this place !
mexican	the chips , salsa , and bean dip are great . recommend carne asada , chicken ricardo 's , and chicken picado . the margarita are awesome ! go here every time i am in town .
mexican	the trashcan nachos are the best . also love the mango salsa . good drink prices and the best bartenders in town ! jerika and lee were so attentive .
mexican	came from out of town and tried it out . this place has great reviews for a reason . owner was nice and accommodating as well . combo 's are cheap and ladies get free margaritas on the weekends from 8-12 .
mexican	the prices were great how have i never been there ?
mexican	great service and a great israeli feed for when you 're craving authentic food . they give you 5-6 salads with your meal which that along could feed you , and then their portions are very generous . check them out , it 's good and you won 't be disappointed .
mexican	awesome restaurant hand made tortillas ... great food and awesome friendly staff ... they were quick and attentive ...
mexican	i ordered a filete a la plancha and it was more than what i could finish . food was great and the michelada hit the spot ! recommending this location ! : )
mexican	the atmosphere was absolutely spectacular , and was so unique ! the food was unbelievably good , in fact- i would say one of the best burgers i have ever had . we went to the restaurant during the day , and the waitstaff was attentive and super helpful . they are a newer restaurant , but certainly take great care of their patrons . the owner , larry , came over and introduced himself . it was a wonderful experience overall , i would highly recommend dining at bodega 13 !
mexican	today was my first time to visit this wonderful new mexican joint tucked away in ne scottsdale . the service was amazing and the staff was very friendly . the adovada and salsa is the best i 've had in az so far . the place had nice ambiance with a wonderful sweet mesquite aroma . the restaurant was clean and i would love to go back during happy hour and dinner .
mexican	awesome restaurant.we went to garde manger friday night and had the best meal ever.the service was top notch and made our night even better ( erica our waitress sam our bartender and alexander overseeing everything ) .you will not be disappointed if you go to garde manger .
mexican	we were stoked to find this after flying in from out of town . plenty of options for the vegetarian / vegans and meat lovers . incredible salsa bar . allow yourself time to look over the menu , definitely not your " american mexican . "
mexican	we eat here at least twice a month ! i almost selfishly hesitated to post this review because it 's already so popular it 's already crowded ; but , it 's worth the wait ! check out the mexican street corn , it 's the best thing on the menu !
mexican	awesome margaritas . awesome mole . highly recommend ! ! everyone should go out of their way to eat here - i always do ! i can 't get enough ! you will not regret it ! !
mexican	we tried 5 different types of tacos and i have nothing bad to say about any of them . i can 't wait to go back !
mexican	i usually get their steak burrito for $ 5 ... definitely a value--the spicy hot sauce paired with it is spicy but absolutely to die for !
mexican	bread very fresh herbs the meats are amazing ! love their cheese too .
mexican	paco , the executive chef , came by and told us it was a family recipe . i wish i was part of his family just so i could eat the flan at family gatherings . great service , and incredible folks .
mexican	the test of a good oaxacan restaurant is how good its mole negro is . mixing different kinds of chilies with chocolate and mexican cinnamon is quite a culinary balancing act , and this place does it really well . the chicken which was blanketed by the rich mole negro oaxaqueño was juicy and tender , and thank goodness there were tortillas on the side to sop up every bit of the tasty mole . definitely a place for many repeat visits .
mexican	definitely worth the trip . if you 're doing an extended stay , byob get the grilled fish tacos . you will not regret it ... unless you don 't like fish . then get something else .
mexican	awesome seafood .... i loved the spicy octopus taco , coconut shrimp , fried fish and agua chiles .... the mango margaritas are very tasty and a must to try ... wonderful customer service ! !
mexican	able to get a 3 taco combo , 2 tamales , chips and guacamole and a big bowl of menudo for less than 20 $ ! ! ! if you 're in the area , definitely check this place out !
mexican	have yet to buy anything that has disappointed me in any way . i love their spicy sauce and buy jars of it to put it on everything . empanadas sell out quickly so get there early .
mexican	the self serve hot sauce bar has an unbelievably wide selection so there 's something for everybody . self-serve style drinks station . serves beer as well . great style , food and vibes inside . would definitely head back for late night eats .
mexican	seriously good food . my three kids loved their food ( tacos , chick fingers and quesadilla ) and my wife and i went to town on ours . i had the rollo prava with canitas . delicious ! clean place , nice people , and all around a great lunch .
mexican	seriously , if you like tacos look no further . taco y taco is just off the charts good . been to both in town and they are both great . this place is a little more trendy , the tropicana one is a little more authentic . but both have great street tacos . the el pastor is so good .
mexican	great chips and salsa with four types if you ask for the extra hot diablo ! fajitas with steak were excellent , rice and beans good .
mexican	awesome servers , great padron peppers , sliders , fries , steaks and infused martinis !
mexican	always smiling . clean place and as always , delicious food at really good prices .. couldn 't think of a better spot for football game food or late night munchies
mexican	the menu is deep and diverse with something for everyone 's taste buds . took a group of six for lunch today . everything was amazing . i especially liked the beef skewers , the and the artichoke hearts . we sampled 7 dishes and ordered a total of 10 , since we doubled up on the skewers , the artichoke , and croquettes ( so amazingly good ! ) the sangria was also great . overall i would highly recommend it
mexican	ivan was great ! ! ! the chimi was one of the best and the marguerites were on point . will visit more . from tampa and glad we chose to eat here for lunch . excellent food and service ! !
mexican	the waiter was very attentive and helpful . the dishes are huge ! i ended up getting chicken and beef enchiladas and they were very good even though i wish they had a little more meat in them but they were cooked perfectly . the beans and rice are awesome ! they turned out to be my favorite part of the meal .
mexican	the empanadas were delicious , i had the special of the day and it was so satisfying .
mexican	super authentic as well . everything is reasonably priced . overall , it was absolutely wonderful ! : )
mexican	the staff was very friendly and being here felt like i 've been coming for years . i would definitely recommend it to anyone in the mgm grand or if your visiting vegas .
mexican	thank you so much : ) they did an excellent job ! thanks for my birthday surprise as well with a giant sombrero and tasty shot of tequila . we had a great time !
mexican	really . just come try it ! great taco stand next door too !
mexican	the only reason i didn 't give 5 stars is the tortilla chips were a little flimsy . i ordered the monterrey and a margarita , both excellent !
mexican	you must try new taco taste in vegas . my daughter and i also like kimchi fried rice . fish and shrimp tacos are the best ! !
mexican	they made everything to my liking and the guac ... yum ! ! !
mexican	you got to try the " nom nom breakfast burrito " so good we are definitely coming back . love the drive thru option as well .
mexican	all the food tasted homemade because ... it was ! you must go to this place just please don 't come with my family wants to because parking is limited .
mexican	awesome food ! ! awesome prices ! ! for the last 10 years this place has always hit the spot ! ! i used to go to the one in south phoenix but have started going to this one when i found out about it a year ago .

mexican	delicious food ! they are not stingy with their drinks which is a plus ! will be coming back for sure !
mexican	even better food . starlord provided amazing service and reccomended the best burrito i 've ever had .
mexican	love the convenience of the location too ! the staff is also always welcoming to their customers and definitely a great idea to come wednesday nights cause there 's a car show right outside ( ; # streetbreed
mexican	no matter the time you 're certain to have a great time . it 's menu will entice you to try everything once you 've enjoyed one entry . festive mood , music and vibe . the bar tenders and servers are welcoming and provide a genuine feeling that you 're truly welcomed and they 're fun . jim , the owner , is a perfect host .
mexican	anna helped us out today . she was very friendly and suggested some great meals for us . she recommended the chicken fajitas for me that was perfect ! my friends really enjoyed their meals and drinks . she constantly checked on us with a friendly smile . i guess i was even happier that a friend picked up my meal ! ; - ) . i would highly recommend this place ! ask for anna ! !
mexican	awesome service / food / prices it was my favorite place to get mexican food when i lived in that part of phoenix .
mexican	we ordered suckling pig but were out . can 't fault we ordered at 10 : 30 on a friday night . ordered cavier flight , spanish ham and wagu steak = fabulous meal .
mexican	please take down menudo from the menu , almost never available every sunday .
mexican	came in on taco tuesday and could not have been more pleased .
mexican	their taquitos and chicken tacos were amazing and so were the rice & beans . they have a bar making all drinks so they 're all top notch quality which was awesome , i hate watered down coke . the staff was very accommodating when i asked to move due to being sat next to two screaming babies in a small room . the price was reasonable for the area , around $ 20 a person .
mexican	came here from out of town on cinco de mayo . stayed for hours and had a blast . will definitely return next time i 'm in scottsdale !
mexican	super stoked we gave this little place a chance .
mexican	awesome service , had an awesome experience from beginning to end.made sure we were taken care of.had a fun time all the while great food and drinks.christina was frecken awesome .

mexican	our waiter was a comedian with great service . his name was filepe .
mexican	i go there pretty regularly usually like 2-3 times a week and never had any issues .
mexican	phrank explained the menu to us . the guacamole and chips are really good . you can 't go wrong with any of their plate dishes . drinks are free refills
mexican	proficient staff ! pleasant people behind the counter who moved the long line along quickly . food is improved over what i remember . lots of flavor . they now compete with qdoba for flavor .
mexican	super fresh food , a little hole in the wall spot but don 't let that phase you the food is amazing and full of flavor ! the owner is super nice as are his waiters : )
mexican	the food is so amazing and definitely worth the price . my daughters love coming here . everything on the menu is delicious ! one of my favorite spots in town . and non-gmo ! !
mexican	the host recommended the burger . yes , the burger . it was a mexican burger and it was good ! it came with kettle chips which i love . our waiter was flirty and he kept us laughing !
mexican	they had a line out the door that they moved very quickly and food tasted very fresh. not your typical fast food service. i work nearby and this will definitely be somewhere to go weekly .
mexican	we sat down and were served chips and salsa within thirty seconds . julie , the bartender , was so nice and knowledgable . she made fantastic margaritas and helped us pick out which tacos to order ( also fantastic ) . julie was obviously very busy , but took the time with us to make sure we had everything we needed . we had a great experience !
mexican	we see ricardo every week .. he 's sweet and always remembers everything . love the food and happy hour from 4-7 : 30 monday through thursday . yum !

mexican	feels like you 're in a mexican resort in a way ! great variety of food too ! excellent portions and spot on price .
mexican	nice people . great weekday specials . 99 cent tacos on tuesday are the bomb .
mexican	awesome shrimp burritos , made by guys that really care about quality and flavor
mexican	best mexican rice ! tabelside guacamole ! ! ! ! great service . looking forward to being a regular .
mexican	the margaritas are pricey but they load you up on alcohol so there 's that . the mariachis though ! they came over and rapped for us , i don 't think they were supposed to but it was awesome !
mexican	glad to have found this place . great flavor , i will definitely be back !
mexican	since i moved to az. from tx . i have been searching for good mexican food and i finally found it . our server , eric , was the best . took time to answer our questions , always with a smile . the salsa was great and so were the tacos . we went on monday and the margaritas were only $ 0.99 and were better than most other places . we will be regulars here .
mexican	server is beyond super friendly and service awesomely fast ! ask for alejandro he is the best !
mexican	tried the thai snapper ceviche , jumbo lump crab lettuce cups , diver sea scallops , beef filet and mini burgers ( mushroom ) - everything was beyond delicious !
mexican	if your looking for amazing mexican food with great service give this place a shot , you will not be disappointed !
mexican	smallish place , great food , friendly service . i 'll be back .
mexican	dinner is even better with gaucho steak ribeye . we sat at the bar and tanya was absolutely fantastic server / bartender . i would very much recommend border grill !
mexican	cheap delicious lunch . loved this place . super friendly and relatable .
mexican	so good ! ! the staff was very helpful and friendly ! ! will definitely be coming back to this place next time ! !
mexican	awesome smoker ... great meats and sauce ... love the chips and the owners are great guys ... not fancy .. just tasty
mexican	so authentic . so good ... every taco meat you can imagine . all are delicious . an oasis of yummy , affordable goodness surrounded by expensive , fake high-rise casino hotels . this is where the workers in those fake high-rise casinos eat . simply awesome ...
mexican	so glad they opened one out here . know that it is a street taco place . not a full out me i restaurant . unbelievable flavor ... hence sabor !
mexican	so glad they opened up over here . good and service are very good . attentive but not pesky servers . we 're going back ! welcome to the hood
mexican	so good ! we had an event and they catered the food . it was hot , fresh , and delicious ! i 'm going there soon . the owner omar is very kind and great to work with . he obviously takes great pride in his restaurant , and it shows in the quality of the food . a must-visit in tempe !
mexican	i enjoyed sitting in the window drinking tres generaciones tequila on the rocks with lime ! they do charge for their chips and salsa ... the salsa amazing , but the chips were a little heavy ... i prefer corn tortilla chips .. they were so heavy they might have been flour . my food was delicious .. i ordered an entree of mahi mahi that was prepared with a chipotle tomato sauce that had jalapeños and green olives in it . sooo good . it was served with rice and avocado slices over lettuce . i will definitely go back again !
mexican	i got my money worth and the service was awesome , felt like i was back home .
mexican	i had the chile relleno with adovada and it was delicious ! lots of people and parking was tight but well worth the drive !
mexican	ahi tuna , lamb chops , firefly fries . all were great and cant wait to come back for the whole menu .
mexican	only mexican place in the downtown area that does it right and actually serves authentic fare . good drinks and food that 's actually mexican and delicious . go for the classic mexico d.f. experience and get the tacos al pastor with a negra modelo !
mexican	the food is fantastic and i never leave unsatisfied . the trio is perfect to get started and we usually order a few different things to share . good vibes and great staff ! now that the weather is ideal , sitting outside on the patio is my favorite place to go !
mexican	i was getting my truck worked on down the street and juan flagged me down ! very impressed with the portions ! steak tacos were amazing ! and guacamole is not extra ! will be going back to get my taco head fix in the future .
mexican	homemade goodness that 's prepared right in front of you . authentic arepas with a glorious twist . not to mention they have pilot coffee roasters on tap , enough said right !
mexican	it might be the reason for all the traffic at the decatur exit off of 215 . best fish tacos and the adobada torta is one of the best sandwiches in town !
mexican	the coffee is amazing and has a delicious bold flavor .. and the food is amazing as well .. ive been there a few times and it always awesome .. i get the iced salted caramel its delicious ! ! ! i definitely recommend this place to all my fellow coffee lovers ! ! ! !
mexican	we had a great server named jovanny . he 's so friendly and makes your visit here feel like home . great service ! we are visiting from la and decided to try some new spots . i definitely recommend this place ! and thank you to jovanny for taking care of us and our 1 year old while we dined here ! we tried the vegan loaded nachos and filet mignon nachos .. both were very yummy ! both had a good spicy kick as well . also tried the house margarita , not overly strong and very tasty .
mexican	we were tired of the crappy and expensive food at the strip and head out to this place . awesome service , fresh ingredients , and really good food
mexican	we love the food here . they have a " simple menu which i love . the mexican corn and the ceviche are our favorites . the churro is also to die for . i actually contemplated having the churro for dinner tonight . the service here is quick and the servers are all super friendly . thanks to our server tonight danielle for the great service . ! !
mexican	terrific mix of caribbean and mediterranean food . love the shawarma plate .
mexican	great set up , low key , and artisanal . get the honey vanilla latte . not too sweet plenty of taste .
mexican	the place is clean and someone checks on us to make sure we are doing okay . did i mention how good the food is ? ? ? ?
mexican	food us really good too ! i had the burrito and my friend had the nachos , which for the price was an insane amount of nachos . had a great experience with both food and staff , what more could you ask for ? would definitely recommend !
mexican	fry bread is huge and can be shared ! ! i love it we will definitely be back with the whole family !
mexican	joel and a hispanic gentleman with braces are very friendly and accommodating ! they make the visit so much better , they truly know what customer service is and they are super quick so you get your yummy food fast . it 's now my favorite place to eat- bye chipotle !
mexican	staff knows the products , and can tell you about them in detail . fast service , and some of the best mexican we have had . we were a fan of momocho as well , but the limited seating there made it more of a destination spot for us ... here we would not worry so much about getting a table . i got the pork belly taquitos .... best dish i have had in a while ! we also got the goat cheese guacamole , and as i had told my friends i think goat cheese should be in everything ! ! nice job ! can 't wait to get back there !
mexican	nice compact menu ! food and drinks delightful ! don 't know what to order ? ! ? ! ask ! recommendations suited to your taste ! you gotta try it but come from 176 denison is currently closed going east .
mexican	they are so nice ! manager is very friendly and of course always good food !
mexican	awesome steak burrito these guys don 't charge enough come get it it 's real good food and it 's cheap price for five bucks for a big ole burrito they definitely need to raise their prices
mexican	the owner is super down to earth and chill . next time i 'm in vegas , i will be going back ! !
mexican	love having lunch here i always crave their tacos they are really good !
mexican	i almost never drink juice but when i 'm in st george i can 't turn down a chance to have their chica morada ( peruvian purple corn ) or maracuya ( passion fruit ) drinks ! i only wish the huacainia sauce was spicier !
mexican	stopped in based on reviews and was not disappointed . the street tacos were great ; my husband had the el jefe burrito - all freshly prepared and delicious . the perfect ending was the made to order churros !
mexican	all the ingredients are fresh and the chicken taco taste amazing ! my new favorite taco place in az .
mexican	best in phoenix and cheap ! the place is small but the service and food is amazing . this is my new favorite place for tacos .
mexican	can get a little busy because food is so good but other then that great place to go for great mexican tacos
mexican	for something so simple kinda hard to find good street tacos in the phoenix area . the carne asad tacos are always good but the al pastor is great too . their take on carne asad fries is a little different as well . they do use a nacho cheese and a shredded cheese . nacho cheese may not sound authentic but neither is carne asada fries . what makes this place so good to me is there red salsa ! it 's super hot but has great taste . this location also sells alcohol so you can have a cold one as well .
mexican	we came in and had the chorizo tacos and quesadillas both plain and with carne asada . for four people out total was less than $ 50 . the food is excellent quality and ingredients are top notch . the service is good and employees are very nice . this is the best taco place on fremont street , possibly the best street taco place in vegas .
mexican	mexican street corn is bomb ! ! my new las vegas favorite place for tacos . salsa bar nice selection . open late 7 days a week . they also have lots of good vege only options like soy chorizo tacos if u are into that ...
mexican	can 't go wrong here . only complaint is very limited seating .
mexican	we 've been actively looking for a good spot for over a year . we finally found one . great service . if you go spicy , you might want some horchata . i was humbled .
mexican	huge menu for such a tiny place . great margaritas , excellent , somewhat authentic food for a decent price . check the chalkboard for daily specials ... they 're usually real good .
mexican	stumbled upon this place while on a date and fell in love . the drinks and food were amazing . plantain tacos were like heaven and the tequila tasting was great !
mexican	unlimited small plates of all different types of brunch items . some of my favorites were the french toast , pigs in blankets , and shrimp tacos . plus bottomless mimosas in all kinds of flavors . the staff was amazing especially our server dylan . he handled our group of about 15 wonderfully . i 've been wanting to try this place and i 'm so glad i did ! go .... you won 't be sorry ! also they have a great selection of gluten free item which was necessary for a few in our group .
mexican	super delicious . i consider myself a mexican food snob , and i never would have guessed chinese mexican together would become an addiction .. those shishito pepper things i literally eat almost every day at home . then i had the pleasure of going there for brunch the other day . so good again . a must try
mexican	great atmosphere around late lunch time , and definitely worth coming to for the food . brittney was wonderful with suggestions and very attentive . if you 're not feeling super hungry it 's worth it just stopping in for daddy 's margaritas and amazing house chips and salsa . five stars .
mexican	ordered the signature 3 amigos , steak & eggs and a byo . 2nd time coming here so glad we tried the burrito this time . although the bowl was also good , the burritos somehow tasted so much better . they were very generous with the protein , packed everything in a 2 " diameter burrito .
mexican	have tried a little of everything from tempura tacos to chilli cheeseburger to the french toast . it 's all worth a try . if you 're looking for something good and different than most restaurants , this is a great place .
mexican	place is busy but the employees keep the flow and you don 't wait long at all . great food !
mexican	easy parking , clean , and great seating area . reason i 'm writing this review because the food was properly made . food came out looking like the pictures for once ....
mexican	great salsa . excellent cheese sauce . i would really like to box this place up and plop it down in tx where it belongs . i don 't have one bad word to say about the place . it 's greatness .
mexican	this is a fast casual place , you wait in line to place your order then sit for them to bring your food so if it 's busy ( which it likely will be ) the standing can get tiring but the food is worth the wait . we got a variety of tacos and the chips and guacamole . my personal favourites were the bulgogi and the chicken tinga . we will definitely be going back !
mexican	great food , and awesome staff ! the portions are solid and the agua fresca flavors are great .
mexican	wifey and i were at eaton center and decided to get tacos and we were not disappointed ! we each had the fish taco and the carnita and shared chips and salsa . the battered fish was perfectly fried with a hefty amount of slaw topping while the pork on the carnita was nice and tender . their chips are fried in house and amazingly crispy . on top of the food the service was great and all staff were super friendly . 4 bucks for a generously sized taco . i will definitely be back !
mexican	tip-different tacos served at different stations . pay at cashier near front . definitely liked the lengua . so authentic and very reasonable prices .
mexican	awesome tacos and asada fries very friendly people very good price considering its on the strip will come back for more every time i visit ! ! !
mexican	a lot of vegan / gluten free options ! try the sweet potato burrito or a taco on a corn tortilla !
mexican	i go here especially to have the the shrimp tacos and burritos . shrimp tacos and burritos are those where you dont get in every taco or burrito place . i am so happy that rubio 's makes these .
mexican	i love the carne asada burrito and you can get a massive one or a normal size too . a bit pricey for tacos ( more expensive than filibertos for sure ) but delicious . you can grab a beer there too which is great for after work / class . there are huge lines during lunch when school is in session so beware !
mexican	the shredded chicken tacos and sweet potato tacos are spot on . they could have larger containers of salsa , and the guac was good but too creamy for me .
mexican	can get crowded and loud . would be a good place for a group of hearing impaired people that can communicate through sign language . which i actually did witness there when i went .
mexican	and all very affordable . a unique place with real character and friendly folks . they also have some good hotdogs for those with kids who don 't like tacos .
mexican	i went at lunch time and had 3 tacos : al pastor , carne asada , and lengua . all were good , but al pastor was the best , imo . there was a big line , but the well worth the wait .
mexican	we love this place and go here often for taco tuesday . tacos are $ 1.50 each on tuesday ! get here early though , there 's always a line !
mexican	i had the carne asada tacos , the quesadilla and a vampiro . quesadilla was least favorite of all 3 due to tortilla tasting like store bought instead of homemade . we will definitely be back every week to this establishment . highly recommend the vampiro
mexican	but they need a better system . it 's pretty chaotic inside . different lines for different foods . the nice taco man ordered for wife from other food stations so she didn 't have to stand in line again . the cashiers could be a little friendlier . 11 am and the place was already pretty full , at least you know it 's good place to eat . tip your taco man !
mexican	i had the frozen strawberry margarita and my husband had the house margarita , both were excellent . portions are a tad on the small side for the price , but the quality was really good . it was about a ten minute wait at 7pm on a saturday . prompt service , clean bathrooms . my only negative was that it was pretty loud in the restaurant .
mexican	awesome tacos. disappointed with the bar service- we felt rushed and they got our drinks wrong twice. will definitely come back but probably will stick to sitting at a table
mexican	awesome tacos especially the al pastor .prices are great considering the strip.the place was packed when i got there but the line went pretty quick and will definitely come back when back in vegas .everyone should go try them ! !
mexican	it 's a lot larger than i thought so i was pleasantly surprised . it 's a super good deal and it brings authentic flavors , even though it 's on a flour tortillas . ( which i would think a lot of people would prefer anyways ... especially in the hood that it 's in ) definitely a great place to go daily !
mexican	friendly service . always fresh food . you will smile after ypur first bite
mexican	i 'm sold . i come here pretty often since i live close by . never been a let down . their salsa and hot sauces are great too . can 't go wrong .
mexican	bonus : this is licensed , and has some mexican shopping ingredients . if you 're looking for a simple and easy sit-down place near dufferin and bloor i highly recommend it . they have free parking behind the place .
mexican	great if you want to have a beer or margarita instead of just a drive-thru street taco which are so prevalent in phoenix . $ 1 taco tuesday is a real deal ! i also tried the pozole : yummmm
mexican	great margaritas ! ! ! ! good service and friendly . don 't know if anyone knew , but the kevin mchale from the boston celtics was eating here with his family while we dined also .
mexican	my favorite was shrimp and fish . chips and salsa at your table with a selection of salsas , green was my favorite . always have to try out the beans and rice , super delicious , the beans were so creamy and the rice was so buttery and fluffy ! my favorite new taco place !
mexican	great service , friendly fast passed atmosphere . came for lunch with my hubby . will be back to try the burritos and a house margarita as i hear they are amazing !
mexican	great value . highly recommend the fish street taco . one of the best tacos i 've ever had . love how they have chips and salsa when you sit , and a diverse selection of salsas for your tacos . they even have rotisserie chicken which surprised me . it is excellent . if you are in the neighbourhood and in the mood for tacos there is no better choice on this street .
mexican	just what a taco shack should look like , smell like , and feel like . small counter to sit at and down a few tasty tacos . flavor of the day changes frequently and it 's always a great mix up of flavors . all the house tacos are fire and fresh . only wish there was a beach outside the door instead of carson .
mexican	had 3 varieties , alpastor , pibil and baja fish . all three were excellent . service was perfect as well . price was very reasonable as well . highly recommended ! ! ! !
mexican	had the tripas ( extra crunchy ) and asada tacos , the handmade tortillas were perfect !
mexican	have decent vegan option which was the saviour for my friend . i totally enjoyed the chicken option . we ordered nacho 's on the side which were also very very good . overall a very good mexican place to eat especially since it 's open late night also .
mexican	it 's difficult to find restaurants that make their own taco shells . this place does and they are good- crunchy , but not too oily . iced cold beer . good prices as well . my new favorite taco place .
mexican	i go there every saturday after the club with my homeboys and the carne asada fries are my favorite ! ! ! ! ! ! ! can 't forget those spicy jalapeno juiced up carrots either ! ! ! ! ! 5 stars ! ! ! ! ! !
mexican	if you are wandering around the strip in las vegas wanting s reasonably priced and delicious quick meal stop here . the service is friendly and the food court is clean and comfortable . the tacos are delicious . authentic-tasting " street tacos . " sauces are awesome and everything tastes fresh . will definitely be back !
mexican	i had carne and pastor , both were excellent ! juan is an awesome dude who knows how to take care of his customers !
mexican	quesadillas are good too , but there isn 't much of a taste-difference . we also tried a burrito , but it wasn 't that impressive at all . the beans were good , but i probably wouldn 't order them again . indoor seating is very limited , so avoid peak times if you are trying to sit inside . parking is also a bit of a challenge at times . overall , this is a tasty little lunch spot . you can 't really go wrong with what you order . my biggest complaint is the flies inside . eat a taco in one hand and swat flies with the other .
mexican	i had the spicy margarita and caitlin the bartender waited on me she was awesome and super friendly . i 'll definitely be back
mexican	i loved the grilled skirt steak , my buddy likes the carnitas the most . if you enjoy guacamole get the tropical , it has a vibrant flavor with a refreshing finish .
mexican	i 'm giving it a 4 because it was very crowded . the salsa bar was not in the best place for such high volume . too close to the tables by the wall . people were over each other . the food was great tho !
mexican	i 'm in pittsburgh for a week and i 've been twice already . i 'll probably go again before i leave . small quirky place with limited seating , but delicious tacos .
mexican	i 'm always on the go so when i need to pick something up quickly , speedy 's is my go to ! typical mexican food options but their tacos are my favorite .
mexican	i ordered 4 thinking they would be the small street tacos . i was wrong . they are at least twice that size and packed full . great food , great value . will definitely be going back for more .
mexican	i was one of three white guys in the place and i was wondering what some of stuff on the menu was . if you squirm when out of your comfort zone , this may not be for you ... as the beef tongue and beef head tacos spanked the pork taco ! ps . it is only the asada line that is to the left ... i finally figured that one out . everything else is available in the right-side line . i could have gone here everyday i was in las vegas . i hope to get back .
mexican	great service , nice owners . rice and beans on point , chips and salsa great ; but the flan was amazing . will be back for sure .
mexican	line can be tough and not much space to eat inside but the quality makes up for it .
mexican	service was great they got us an outdoor table right away . the three of us split chips and salsa , corn , and two plates of tacos ( chicken & mahi mahi ) . we had leftovers , perfect amount . all the food had amazing flavors- so good . we got the cucumber mint margaritas , perfect on a hot day . service was awesome not only by our server but the other wait staff as well . highly recommend . there 's free parking below the shopping center as well .
mexican	my boyfriend and i are great fans ! they are not too spicy or bland . the employees really know what they are doing . looks clean and sanitary for a fast food taco spot .
mexican	$ 2 gets you a small taco with choice of meat and unlimited toppings . buy 1 or 2 for a quick snack or even 3-4 for a full-on meal if you want . the guys hanging around are usually very talkative with each other but also very friendly . if you get thirsty , wash your tacos down with some jarritos or mexican coke !
mexican	fish tacos and shrimp tacos . give it a try , its good !
mexican	pastor , carne , and barbacoa are super delicous . can 't wait to try more of the menu .
mexican	awesome tacos , quesadillas etc ... a must stop if going downtown ( from the strip ) .
mexican	salsa bar is super fresh and offers many unique combos . my favorite was the spicy peanutty salsa . soooo good . the place looks a little dicey from the outside but the food is top notch and service is outstanding .
mexican	seriously . best tacos in oakland , for sure . and i love chipotle . the tortillas fell apart , but they were still awesome .
mexican	the owner is so friendly . and the hot sauce is nice and spicy with great flavor . will be a regular for sure !
mexican	the steak and spicy pork are the bomb ! tried the mexican candies , similar to the chinese candied fruits . really sweet but good . restaurant is kept real clean even the tables outside . the bathroom is spotless !
mexican	the only down side is no place to sit . wish the took credit cards don 't always have cash . love this place .
mexican	the steak is my personal favorite , but the chicken is solid as well . condiments are simple : chopped green stuff , salsa verde or red salsa , and lime . the green salsa is tangy , the red is ridiculously hot . i would not recommend the red sauce - i like hot stuff and it was unbearable .
mexican	they give you a great group of out of the box tacos to choose from and have great sides as well . the guy that seated me said that they were just recently voted best tacos in wisconsi
mexican	they have a huge variety of meats . had the al pastor , carnitas , and birria . best pastor i 've ever had , very flavorful with little bits of char on the pork . carnitas was delicious and nicely crisp . birria was also great , the flavor of the goat really came through ( it was a pleasant surprise to see goat on the menu ) . there 's a nice salsa bar with green & red salsas , limes , cabbage , onions with cilantro , etc . the red sauce that comes with orders is quite hot - a little goes a long way . can 't wait to come back soon .
mexican	try anything with chili verde . taco tuesdays is a mob scene . family run . not a chain . five stars for awesomeness !
mexican	two thumbs up for the ladies at the grill . thanks catarina for great service !
mexican	we ordered for a large party and everyone loves their tacos especially the veggie / vegan ones ! will be our go to for tacos !
mexican	we 're actually heading back home to l.a. and wanted some mexican food and found tho place here on yelp . it happened to be taco tuesday too , so tacos were only 1.25 ! they were very , very good ! and their house made salsa is amazing ! not super hot , but the flavor is incredible ! check this place out ! ! !
mexican	we tried carne asada , al pastor , and the been and cheese burrito . all were excellent . we loved the chips and salsa . great service .
mexican	when you normally think of eating tacos in arizona you may associate those thoughts with food that you have had in texas or new mexico . not so at this place . the street tacos at los taquitos are more like the type that you would expect to get in mexico . the carne asada is fabulous , and the pastor ( marinated pork ) is awesome as well . on tuesdays many of the taco selections are dirt cheap . i 'm also a big fan of their pazole . some of the other menu items seem run of the mill to me though . to sum up , it 's all about the tacos !
mexican	i 've been here a hand full of times & always greeted with a friendly smile & receives great food in a flash . definitely one of the best taco joints in toronto .
mexican	pollo , carnitas and pastor street tacos for $ 1 . and i 'm always weary about super cheap tacos but these were excellent ! most definitely will be coming back soon and often !
mexican	had the beef and pork . burritos were good . beef enchilada was great ... 5 people and everyone enjoyed their meal ( raves for the steak tacos ) . great service too !
mexican	i tried the cheese and jalepeno one , it was awesome . i also had the cheese enchilada with rice and beans , also awesome . the enchilada sauce is noteworthy . the free chips and salsa come with green salsa and beans . beans ! they know the key to my heart . vegetarians have the normal options - cheese enchiladas , cheese tamales , vegetarian burrito , tostadas . prices are normal for a mexican restaurant , my two-item combo was $ 12.99 , but the tamale combos are more expensive . two enchilada combos were $ 9.99 . service was fast and friendly , i will definitely go here again if i am in vegas and craving mexican food .
mexican	black rice is the best ! and the tuna cones ... and the ceviche ... and the grilled calamari . yum !
mexican	everything served to us were fantastic . the chicken croquette , ox tail , scallops , duck salad , pork tacos mmm mmmm . definitely get a pitcher of red sangria !
mexican	we had the tortilla soup , warmed olives , roasted beet and green bean salad . a perfect tasting meal . very nice service .
mexican	the pork tenderloin was excellent too ! service was friendly and helpful and i cannot wait to go again .
mexican	worth it to go during happy hour . they don 't advertise it but happy hour is monday through friday 11-4 : 30pm and you have to sit at the bar . we sat at the bar on friday but the bartender did not offer the happy hour menu until i asked for it . so worth it ! i ordered red sangria . delicious ! we also ordered manchega , squids , meatball , chorizo , gambas , mussels , yellowtail , and oxtail . everything was delicious but the squids and manchega and yellowtail were my favorite !
mexican	great salsa . i give it a fifth star for the native san diego gringo owner and his " bro " accent . wouldn 't be surprised if he skateboarded to work on a long board .
mexican	taste like real mexican food . we got the queso fundido with chorizo , and it was awesome . the salsa isn 't that great , but our meals were great . if ever i 'm out here again , i 'll be sure to stop . don 't expect the most attentive service , but it will do for the small size of the restaurant .
mexican	the beans have a toasted taste and cheese is amazing , with the tortilla it tastes just amazing . rice was not as good as everything else . it tasted a bit bland . - joshua son of mrs. picky
mexican	i 've tried the gringo tacos , the cactus and vegetarian as well . i like how the chips are thicker here so when i go to dip into my mountain of guacamole , they don 't break into pieces . the churros are great , especially paired with the ice cream . happy hour and taco tuesday is a killer deal , i love the margaritas . very cool atmosphere , i like the day of the dead skulls , along with the food truck lodged inside of the restaurant . yay tacos !
mexican	fast , fresh , and delicious . we both had the bowl . plenty of food and we both enjoyed . build your own type of place , just like chipotle . friendly workers too !
mexican	it overlooks the whole strip and you can watch the sunset on the mountains . just a beautiful sight . they have a full bar and delicious tacos . i have a carnitas , steak and chicken taco and some churros . it was all delicious . best way to end the trip
mexican	priced right . chips and salsa fresh and tasty ! ! be sure to orderchile con queso with the chips . it 's fresh and delish server was very attentive and friendly
mexican	i met the owner felipe who was gracious and kind , he explained the menu options that are available on the menu . this location is perfect because they have a parking lot so no worries about looking for a meter or space . they offer a unique twist to the hot dog and because of the plant based options available i will definitely be a repeat customer .
mexican	the best tamales at a reasonable price ! great family run business . you must go !
mexican	the food here is fresh and refreshing ... i had the rolled tacos and they were simply delicious . the customer service is above and beyond !
mexican	the food is great . the best mexican food i 've had since moving to phoenix . also , awesome decorations and great portions for a great price .
mexican	the food was amazing and inexpensive . we got sat , we 're greeted instantly with chips and a yummy corn salsa by our server who took our drink and appetizer order immediately . of we course we had to try the queso .. not what we were expecting , but it was really good ( we actually ended up mixing the corn salsa with the queso dip - bangin ! ) . we definitely miss this place now that we are living back in maryland !
mexican	the lines around the corner tell the story--great argentinian grilled meats , and everything to go with them . nice bright space in a building that sat empty for too long . can 't wait to go back !
mexican	the margarita 's will kick your a * * and the food is soooooo good . not authentic mex but the best american mexican ( even better if you ask me ) you will find in phoenix ! ! ! ! huge portions and value priced .
mexican	he remembers everyone 's name and is super friendly ! food is amazing ! not fast food or taco shop food at all ! ! ! i wish they did nachos and were open later ... can 't say enough about this place . a must try !
mexican	the wak-a-mole was the best ever . shrimp tacos too , very unusual and tasty . flan was great . no more on the border for us .
mexican	this eatery is a whole lot of delish ! fish tacos are some of the best i 've had . we will be back !
mexican	this is my favorite mexican restaurant in phoenix . the food is amazing , i get the taloc taco , it 's vegan ! the real shining star of this place is the salsa bar . always a ton of options , all ranging in different levels of spice . be careful , you might think the fruity one won 't be spicy , but it 'll surprise you : ) the drinks are also good and reasonably priced . always consistent , always good .
mexican	, this is the " hole in the wall " i have read about .. made the drive and glad i did .. very small inside but food was real deal . lamb carved off the spit for gyros . will return .
mexican	this little hole in the wall mexican place is the best . love the blackened shrimp tacos and my husband always gets the chicken burrito . so good !
mexican	tijuana style tacos in vegas , i thought i was dreaming when i saw the sign . so refreshing after days of expensive mediocre food and buffets with taco-bell style mexican food ( wtf ? ? ? ) fresh made corn tortillas .... grilled onions and peppers ... amazing grilled meats and salsas . that 's all you need .
mexican	ask for emily , she was attentive and courteous . im from san diego just visiting az and i would definitely recommend this to anyone ! we ordered a shrimp dish and hubby ordered the meatloaf , all very delicious . specially the tortillas they served us as soon as we sat down ! try the margaritas ! ! just awesome ! cute lighting decor and heated outdoor seating ! oh and dont forget to order the banana dessert with blackberries ! ! so good !
mexican	good food great show . thank you ! ! will be coming back soon . howard the owner was a righteous dude . definitely made us feel at home and welcome . and the loaded nachos are kick ass # sidebiceps
mexican	and the food is out of this world . love you guys
mexican	lunch hour is always packed but service is fast . good but definitely not the greatest . i will say this : their hard-shell chicken tacos are the best . the chicken still had some cuerito on it ( skin ) giving it that extra flavor that sets it apart from regularly chopped chicken . just pour some of that sauce they make on it and your good to go . ¡ buen provecho !
mexican	great flavors and plenty of options . fair prices . decor is nothing to write home about but you 're not there for the ambience . the food is the star . a must try when you are in phoenix . place is always busy ! in the sunnyslope area which is a little seedy but don 't let that stop you . they have another location in s. phoenix too .
mexican	loved every bite ! my fiancé and i have been struggling to find a good torta spot ever since we returned from our trip to guadalajara . everything was cooked to order and tasted very fresh . the staff were also very friendly . great food , great service . will be back again !
mexican	this place is just solid all the way around . i usually eat here once a week and it never gets old . awesome place to cater lunch to your office as well . everything i 've had here is good .
mexican	fresh salsas , frescas , bakery items , meats , and cheeses . restaurant / cafeteria inside is tasty and you can make your food exactly how you want it ( bean and cactus burrito ! ! ) . we go here at least once a week to grab our non-organic stuff ... kiwis , papayas , mangos , etc. and the tortillas ... because they are gigantic ! our bill 's never been over $ 40 for four big bags of produce !
mexican	everything i 've had here has been great , and they have liquor now ! service is always friendly and fast . definitely one of my favorite spots to go !
mexican	got the az burrito . yummy green chili pork ! in d terminal right by boarding
mexican	great for your vegetarian friends , too . tasty . be sure to load on that orange hot sauce on the table . burritos are the way to go .... although the salmon quinoa is interesting sounding ... it can be somewhat dry . the back patio is usually packed- so go to dinner a littler earlier than usual .
mexican	it 's chipotle , pizza style . ingredients are fresh and it 's practically unlimited toppings . enough said .
mexican	i was raised in venezuela and i can tell you that this food is as close to the real thing you will come across outside of venezuela . be sure to talk to moises the owner - fantastic guy . when you go , be sure to try the empanadas and arepas ... ask for black beans and rice on the side . as good as it gets . if you are in the mood to try something new , give my arepa a try . food is so good that i have been known to by it , and ship to family in other parts of the us . when was the last time you did that ? ! ? ! ? ! ? !
mexican	pick up you tapas and tacos and sit outside ( shaded with misters ) all the food is fresh . que no pare la fiesta !
mexican	dive . old school independent . guacamole excellent . fajitas had everything right . salsa perfection
mexican	very friendly and helpful staff . food was superb ! we tried a few of the suggestions from the owner including the yuca fries . everything was excellent . the fruit drinks were very good as well .
mexican	we had the chile rellenos and some tacos . very good food and service was very friendly . a big place with most tables having some sort of view .
mexican	food was good . service was excellent . you get chips , salsa and beans complimentary to start . it was a little noisy in there however . i would come back .
mexican	was on vacation with my vegan son and they have a large variety of fun vegan items to chose from that are creative and great tasting . he loved the sweet potato hash and the vegan chorizo . i had the heuvos rancheros and they were delicious . seasoned black beans and crunchy chips . even their coffee drinks were delicious . a must see visit ! !
mexican	they have a really good happy hour during the week too . this is my " cheers . "
mexican	we had our wedding ceremony hosted here , roughly 60 people , and the whole experience was amazing ! mr. machado was top notch in service . the food was incredible and the guests were raving about the speed of service and quality of the food ! we couldn 't have picked a better restaurant .
mexican	we had the breakfast burritos , one chorizo and one bacon . simple ingredients , but packed with flavor . the tortillas were cooked on the flat grill , which i think really changed the flavor of the whole burrito . i love the fact that they cook to order . i don 't mind waiting when i know that my food is that fresh . the addition of the salsa bar , which included sliced limes , was a perfect touch . can 't wait to go back !
mexican	we had the chicharron de esmerelda and lomo saltada and both were great , especially the cilantro sauce . tried the inca kola and it was really good - kind of like rock n rye . turns out my friends who travel to peru were so jealous , it was a favorite there and hard to find in the us .
mexican	we had to try this since we came to top shelf years ago at this location . the decor is bright , beautiful and authentically mexican . the salsa is fresh with a medium heat and the margarita was equally good . my order of shrimp ceviche tostadas on 3 small crisp tortillas was piled high with tasty shrimp ceviche topped with mangos and an avocado slice . absolutely marvelous ! the flan we shared for dessert was rich and thickly textured - almost cheesecake like . they had a mexican singer / guitarist who sang songs which were mellow enough to be a muted background . we 'll be back !
mexican	we have driven by a few times and finally decided to stop . it was phenomenal . the serve and food was excellent . we don 't speak spanish and are not that familar with columbian food , but we love everything !
mexican	we loved this place ! we sat at the bar to order margaritas and decided to stay there and eat . the service was fantastic . it 's always a good sign when there are a lot of locals sitting at the bar as well . the pork tacos were great ! guacamole and salsa were awesome ! hubby got the chicken and waffles and would not share . they were that good ! try the cucumber jalapeño margarita . seriously it 's to die for . overall this place gets an a + !
mexican	went here for dinner with the family . found this place in the phoenix magazine top ten best mexican food places & i can see why . the service was great . & the torta i had was amazing .
mexican	we stopped here by chance and boy are we glad we did . the entertainment was the key . free magic and guitar playing was phenomenal . the food was ok . the venue was cool . service good . if you want to see a good show for free drop in at 9pm . well worth it .
mexican	we went their second night open and both service and food were great ! love the decorations . we thought that the prices were good too and the margs were better than average . it is a very good family restaurant . at our table we had shrimp , fish and burrito and they didn 't stand a chance , everything was devoured !
mexican	so different than any i 've had before , they had a bunch of cool options to try out . the nacho ones were my favorite , but all their spicy ones are good too . well priced as well and super cool interior of the restaurant !
mexican	wish they had one in cali . food was amazing , i tried the chicken burrito i believe it 's called waikiki . customer service is amazing too , very attentive
mexican	found out that there workers some of them where new and i had no clue ! ! ! shout-out to those who served !
mexican	staff very friendly . can 't wait to go back . i ordered the rosemary braised beef and side of brussels sprouts . delicious . love the bacon on the brussels sprouts .
mexican	i had the prefix lunch with bacalao croquettes , royal dorade and finished with the baklava ice cream . every plate was perfect the croquettes were so light i don 't know how the kept them on the plate . beautiful decor , joelle was cute , professional and made me feel like i was her only customer . i will be back for the octopus !
mexican	you gotta try this location ... friendly clean and as always delicious and fresh food at rubios !
mexican	you made my day . my husband and i had an amazing dinner , i love adobada fries , its tastes so good ! ( only $ 10 ) . we definitely go back !
mexican	the yummy food tastes so good in the belly . came back for a second time in a week ! the aqua fresca strawberry / mango / horchata tastes so refreshing . the kids loved the kids food . the meat was flavored just right . there needs to be more arturo trejo . seriously ? where are the posters of arturo ? get on that !
mexican	we visit here often because it 's close to home ! never disappointed .. * * the cadillac margarita is a must have
mexican	zack was very timely and good was hot and delicious ! loved the kick the salsa has and the fajitas are phenomenal ! !
mexican	awesom fajitas and service is outstanding staff is very freindly one of my new top favorite mexican eateries .
mexican	great food , great beer and great service . fresh made tortillas ! ! ! ! the freshest fish tacos ! ! ! corn salad was great along with the black beans ! ! ! will eat there the next time ! ! ! cool place to go . nice selection of bees ! ! ! ! ! and reasonable prices ! ! ! ! get off the strip and eat there ! ! !
mexican	this is gonna be my new spot every time i 'm coming to vegas plus i 'm from michoacan mexico !
mexican	they have recently expanded and updated and it looks great . the asada street tacos are incredible ! flavorful , juicy , spicy ... everything you want a taco to be !
mexican	prices are much higher than at chipotle in the us . good for an occasional treat . must try the guac and chips !
mexican	and boy am i glad i did ! this place is homey and quaint but don 't let that fool you , their food is superb . i tried the deep fried yucca root , which ended up tasting pretty close to a french fry , and their house specialty seco de carne- a pot roast type of dish that was absolutely delicious ! my parents both enjoyed their meals fully , each of them tried a different type of kabob . i will definitely be heading back soon to try out their other specialties !
mexican	drinks were great , house margarita was nice and i ordered beer because ... beer . at this point i was filled with beer and mexican queso so i wasn 't able to eat my mexican platter , because .... beer . anyway the service was very nice . man bun was a sweet thing with a fine behind . he even drew a little smile on my take home container . so potential baby daddy . i highly recommend this , so give it a go . and beer !
mexican	a whole in the wall where the area around it is kind of shaddy but the food was way batter then i thought ! ! ! !
mexican	highly recommend the chicken croquettes , beef and cheese . the lobster and pineapple was a bit out of balance -- lobster overpowered by a tangy pineapple aspic .... chocolate souffle and apple blossoms excellent .
mexican	a wide variety of dishes but i enjoyed all of them , a top recommendation if you are looking for a variety of small plates .
mexican	we were greeted with chips with 2 salsas , chips were good , salsas were okay . my mini sampler was great , with 2 mini tostadas , 2 mini tacos , taquitos a chimi , and a small tamale . serves with a tostada dish full of sour cream and guacamole . server was efficient and checked on us a few times . a good experience !
mexican	my father and i each had a machaca burrito and the manager let us sample the green chile pork . everything was delicious . i will be back . i did not even try the food item in the name of the restaurant and was still pleased . great work people !
mexican	i kept going back up for more and more spicy adobada tacos- they were so freaking good. i thought that the asada meat was a little dry but delightful nonetheless. this is not gastronomie , it 's street food at it 's finest and probably the most authentic taco experience i 've ever had .
mexican	the beer selection pleased those who did not go for the refreshing margaritas . the guacamole was freshly made and nicely seasoned we had the ahi tacos , the shrimp rellenos ( big juicy shrimp perfectly warmed ) , the mole dish with yummy buracho beans , the chicken asado and the vegetarian enchiladas . every plate was empty and there was talk of licking them . jimmy knew his products and enticed us appropriately .
mexican	a generous serving of homemade red sauce over corn tortilla chips and topped with two over easy eggs , this is a dish that can easily be split with a friend . and the mariachis only add to this place 's ambiance ! you won 't be disappointed--the real deal !
mexican	a wonderful family resturant with excellent food specialites from carolyn 's own recipes .
mexican	their menu is small but you 'll be happy with the choices . i had the pupusas with cheese , beans and pork . if you 've never had food from salvador , they are like pancakes that are filled with delicious ingredients ! ! it comes with a tomato sauce that you can pour on top if you like . very fresh ! great choice if you are sensitive to gluten ! the chef cooks from the heart and only uses fresh ingredients and you can tell in every bite ! the staff is kind , knowledgeable and helpful ! the decor is rustic-modern and relaxed . i 'll be going back soon ! i 'm already missing their food !
mexican	tucked away from bloor street , los guacamoles provided us an out-of-toronto experience from the ambiance , to the stellar service , to most importantly the food . we tried the beef burrito and a selection of their tacos . everything was fresh and authentic . can 't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu !
mexican	el cafetal in indian trail is delicious . very nice inside and a delightful staff . find their coupons and deal on local flavor . make sure you don 't leave until you try dessert !
mexican	the tea selection is vast and delicious and the scones are absolutely unbeatable . trying to recommend this to everyone i know , a small , locally-owned business that deserves to succeed ! also a great place to find presents for family members
mexican	a new friend recommended this place and i 'm so glad we went ! excellent flavor in a big package ! i tried their el biggo chicken burrito with rice , sour cream , tomato & lettuce and hubby and i both shared a sweet potato & black bean soft taco . it was fabulous . i would have never thought that sweet potato would have been good in a taco . i couldn 't have been more wrong ! sweet little joint that is trendy and casual . wish i would have come here sooner !
mexican	the price is right and the food is delicious . i 've been here 5 times and had food catered once . if you 're in the mood for mexican food ... this place is for you . with a large menu you have many choices . you owe it to your taste buds to stop here .
mexican	very personal touch man ! had the fish and steak taco combo , liked them both very much and the hot salsa is super good too .
mexican	glad we opted to come here . corn beg and hash plate was phenomenal . shrimp and pasta again great . we will definitely be back . oh yea the chips and salsa are unbelievable . we will definitely be back . thx served
mexican	made me want to get a tattoo . nice young crowd with friendly service and delish guac ! good food and music make for a good dinner out with a few friends !
mexican	the green chili stew is the best also , i order mine with added carne asada , but just the way it comes is incredible taste . eat here on a regular basis now and have never had any complaints .
mexican	love this place . i have never been somewhere where the workers cared so much for their customers . taco tuesday is fantastic and they also have good prices on their lunch and dinner specials . i am also vegetarian and i can get anything on the menu and get a vegetable blend instead of meat free of charge . a + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + love this place
mexican	i could eat one of each little empanadas . they have multiple flavor options . the services is not bad . the place is chic . and the location is not in a plaza or at a main streets but it in a good location .
mexican	we have never been here before so we didn 't know what to expect . we both tried a dish that looked totally different from what we used to . the fajitas presentation alone was impressive . they tasted as good as the presentation was ! i was surprised also with my burrito . very tender and mouthwatering . we will be back .
mexican	good service , average price , but very clean ! ! no lard in stuff unlike the mexican restaurant next door ! !
mexican	my wife had the camaron a la diabla we sugest you have the mild it down because the hot truely comes from hell . i had the torta cubana it was great man vs food size portion too .... next time in vegas we will definitely come again .
mexican	guy fieri never makes mistakes . love his show and everywhere i go i google places he recommends . food is very delicious . fast service and great atmosphere . if you are in phoenix you must visit this place !
mexican	every detail in the food is authentic , the men that prepare the food are true lovers of what they do . the best i 've had up to this point in places like kensington market and new york aren 't quite like what this place did . arepas are quite difficult to make soft enough to bite into easily but hard enough to contain all the ( expertly ) prepared ingredients . the chorizo was delicious , their green sauce is crazy and their hot sauce has kick ! plantains , avocados and queso andino are a great combination as is but i really recommend this place .
mexican	gotta bump you down js . somewhat of a letdown for a handful of out of town guests who had enjoyed their time at firefly . mussels were tiny , wasn 't feeling the foamy presentation of the pork belly dish ( hello goyemon ! ) and tried a few other dishes which were fine . still , service and white wine sangria is still on point just don 't think i 'm coming back for a while .
mexican	well as the name says vaqueros carne asada we got te carne asada burro , fries , and torta . all were exceptional and a quesadillas that was massive . my kids loved the quesadillas and we thoroughly enjoyed our food the burro was the best . filled with pico de gayo cilantro and guacamole . i love the way the place looks it is cool and fun . will be back if i 'm in the area .
mexican	it 's closed ? this was my favorite place for lunch and dinner when i was in the mood for mexican .
mexican	such delicious food , from the chips and salsa to the drinks to the food ! i honestly can 't believe the negative reviews , and i think they 're incorrect . i 've gone here many times and never had a complaint . for instance , ' i don 't like rice or beans ' ... thennn don 't go to a mexican restaurant . definitely go to this patron in particular , you won 't regret it .
mexican	and that 's a lot of love and i mean it . i am working my way through every menu item and this weekend i will have the platillo de carne asada y nopal and a taco de tripa . i 'm not one for tripe but everything i 've had here is absolutely delicious and i 'm trusting i will have a breakthrough and resolve my fear of the tripe . i hear one must have it extra crispy . i 'm really excited . butterflies in my belly excited ..... like that first time when ...
mexican	so these might be the most friendly people on the planet . this is some damn fine mexican food . you can absolutely get a cheese chile relleno off menu which is so great . we got a ton of different dishes on two visits and i might almost drive the seven hours again just to eat here another time ...
mexican	this place has a real latin feeling going on ! i always get the chimichangas . the refried beans are perfect . the salad is always crisp and fresh . the service is very sweet and hospitable . i 'm getting hungry just writing this review !
mexican	this was definitely a welcome surprise . the food is the best in erie county . very pleasant staff and atmosphere . definitely worth coming back for . their rice is flavorful and the beans really excellent . former spanish teacher here , i know my mexican food !
mexican	we were a party of 16 with various needs , some vegetarians as well . arranged it all two weeks b4 the event including the tapas we wished to be served at each table . everything went without a hitch ! service was flawless and the food was beloved by all including fussy kids , gram , and the whole crowd . thanks for making us such a great party ! a wonderful asset of southern highlands ...
mexican	barcelona has really stepped their game with adding " all you can eat " to their menu . the wait staff is very attentive and accommodating . they always made sure our drinks were topped off and all our acye orders were placed . the atmosphere is very relaxed . my favorite picks from them would have to be their empanadas , chicken skewers , and couscous .
mexican	food was banging . i 've lived near this place for almost 9 years and never bothered to try it . god forgive me , i judged this place too quickly . the parking lot is horrible . i ordered 6 tacos de lengua y al pastor . sis bought her favorite torta de milanesa con papas fritas . horchata wasn 't that great but overall it was delicious . we 're gonna get fat . can 't wait to go back .
mexican	and homemade tortillas , yum . solid fare in downtown mesa .
mexican	they had me at $ 1.85 tacos ! ! ! you really have to try their guacamole . super fresh since they make it to order . theirs is different since it has diced avocado and fresh pico de gallo . very good choice . we ordered one of every taco offered and they did not disappoint . the chilaquiles were great as well . it 's a tiny place , but the girls there are very sweet and give great service . definitely give it a try !
mexican	this place is amaze balls ! tiny little pouches of yummy greasy goodness . its the perfect hangover food or if you 're just in the mood for something naughty but different . this little hole in the wall is right across from the og . if the weather is nice , take a seat outside . i 've had the shredded beef , chicken , pork , and lengua arepas and they are delicious ! most people order 2 or 3 , but i find myself full with just one ... and of course an empanada . service is fantastic and this place is usually poppin so plan to wait a bit for this little taste of venezuela . definitely worth the wait ! !
mexican	everything that needs to be reviewed has been reviwed already so ill make this short . food : 5 / 5 - its actually pretty big doesn 't last me till the next day like some people but satisfying . recommendations chicken , beef , veggie , halibut - thats pretty much all the burritos but i think they have shrimp now .
mexican	the ukrainian woman at the front is always such a delight . she remembers my name , and little things we converse about from time to time . not to mention she always checks on us to make sure we 're okay . the food is always fresh and delicious . i 've taken many friends there and they love the place as much as i do . our hat 's off to the chef and staff ! gracias ! ! !
mexican	it 's a little heavy on the salt , but whatever . the steak chuy 's chimi was awesome , not overcooked . the waitress made sure to let me know it 's covered in green sauce , and substituting red wasn 't a problem . the service was great - never had to ask for a refill , the chip bowl never went empty . delicious , reliable , what more do you want ?
mexican	being a transplant from san diego and dying for mexican food , this is the best place for the real deal , and everyone there is super nice ! this is now a regular place for us . anyone looking for good food and an excellent atmosphere needs to stop here ! and try their top shelf margaritas . ¡ fantastico ! ¡ muy bueno y muchas gracias !
mexican	not you average mexican chain restaurant . go on and try the ceviche and grilled corn instead of the same old tacos you get back home .
mexican	drinks were great , calamari exceptional and the veal part was to , die for . can 't go wrong here ! ! ! !
mexican	loved the smaller portions and that we got to sample a bunch of different dishes we added the bottomless mimosas as well and the waiter seemed to be having fun bringing us different flavored varieties ! our waiter may have been the coolest and the manager was also pretty legit when she came to check on us at our table . fun atmosphere . great food . we will be back !
mexican	where would i be without your taquitos ? this california girl , who hates driving , makes her way all the way to the strip from regent square for the smell and sabor . thank you for always making my rice and beans on the veggie side of the grill , squeezing on extra límon , and just being buena gente . ¡ hasta pronto ! * i 'd give another star if the taqueros weren 't handling money and food with the same glove-less hands ...
mexican	the oatmeal horchata is tasty ! the torta is really an experience !
mexican	i thoroughly enjoyed the fish taco as well . everyone on the double date just got 2 tacos , but deep in my heart i wanted to try every taco on that menu . the mango margarita was delightful and the table chips & salsa is actually pretty yummy and not boring . could be thought of as pricey , but the quality was there and noted . if you want a $ 3 taco , go find a food truck . it 's a trendy spot , but ain 't nothin wrong with that . i got my eye on the chorizo taco for next time .
mexican	came here around 12am and it was popping but the line moves fairly quick . i love that you can go to the side cart and grab as much toppings and salsas as you 'd like with their lil baggies and containers. they could make a spicier salsa cause that shit is nowhere near spicy , but overall the pastor was delicious and i would definitely come back
mexican	the place itself is amazing , the owners and staff are freakin cool . the food is always great even if you go for the happy hour only ! if you can check this place out and bring 1 or 17 of your buddies , . , ,
mexican	the food is always fresh and hot ! the service is always excellent as well ! ! ! the margaritas are on point ! ! ! i use to order arroz con pollo for years at azteca on woodlawn before the one near northlake mall was built . but ever since the one on smith corners blvd was built , i am a more frequent customer because it 's closer . now i order fiesta jalisco . i am addicted ....... you know i have to wash it down with a margarita or two ! ! !
mexican	they 're speedy , you can call ahead and reserve a giant table , and they don 't complain too much about haveing 20 seperate checks . i normally order something small off the lunch menu , because i inevitably fill myself up with chips and salsa before my lunch even comes . i always save room for the desert at the end ! pro tip : if you 're trying to get out of azteca to head towards billy graham , go out the back of the parking lot to come out at the light . making a left onto woodlawn is just plain crazy .
mexican	i thought el guero canelo was the business , but tacos el gordo on the lv strip by riviera ( just past wynn on s. las vegas blvd ) takes the cake . thankfully , they are a tijuana brand and they are here in san diego too . life is good .
mexican	the salsa bar is great too . i did 't try any cocktails but the food was amazing i will be back .
mexican	loved the beef and the chicken chimichangas , and my ' traditional ' margarita was excellent . service was prompt , friendly and courteous . we will go back -- and take friends !
mexican	the ambiance is inviting , comfortable and charming . the food is delicious and authentic . they serve the best guacamole in pittsburgh .
mexican	the small stature from the street does belie the nice open feel of the interior . as for the food , it is superb . i immensely enjoyed the chicken burrito i had . i thought the bean salsa was good , but could use a bit more kick , as i like things spicy . it 's definitely worth checking out .
mexican	you can never go wrong with the enchiladas or the tacos . the portions are very big , so lately we just order the table side quac and split a chicken quesadilla , and we still end up with leftovers . it can get kinda busy on the weekends , but on week nights it 's usually a little quieter . the waitstaff is always friendly and attentive . though it may be just off the beaten path , it is certainly worth the trek and has become a fan favorite here in sewickley .
mexican	you could taste the grilled mahi-mahi and a light hint of the cabage and citrus sauce in each bite . the place was humming with a lot of people , but very easy to hold a conversation at the table . my wife had the steel city burrito , it was made with grilled steak , french fries and cabage , a nice homage to the steak salad with fries that pittsburgh is known for . we ended the meal spliting some fried ice cream . the ice cream took a while , but was worth the wait and it was a nice size portion for the two of us . i will be returning again soon ..... a great place for a nice dinner out .
mexican	the modern decor and open atmosphere enhanced the dining experience . the menu offered freshly made small plates that can easily satisfy the meat eater and vegan alike . my tacos were delicious ! you have option of fried , grilled or pan seared . the tortillas and chips are house made . the fresh table prepared guacamole was as tasty as the previous restaurant located in this location ( a very good thing ) . service was great and the wait staff was very friendly . attached photo - fried oysters , grilled red snapper and grilled shrimp tacos . i will gladly return to taste other menu options .
mexican	i had the baguette with manchego , jamon and djon ; babe had the hickory bourbon croissant . absolutely delicious ! i had a cortado , cream and espresso , i would use the sugar packet unless you like super bitter coffee . i would engage the friendly staff for suggestions ; the service was excellent . we will be going back for dinner , the space is decorated very well .
mexican	tasty food . s little too much rosemary or parsley on the potatoes but very good airport food . great bang for your buck too ... especially for an airport . thanks ashley and ericka !
mexican	seafood relleno is off th charts . this is the best restaurant anywhere in phx metro . if you 've not been here and you 're considering , go ! go ! go ! go ! you will absolutely , 100 % , guaranteeeeeeeddd , have the best food you 've ever eaten .
mexican	enjoyed my taco much more than before . good stuff . solid torta , burrito , and taco shop in the we build it for you vein . completely renovated space that was formerly papa bear 's . very nice space with a happy vibe .
mexican	the guac was most tasty and the salsa was pretty good too ! we focused on trying a few margaritas , and the variety of fruit flavors they have is excellent ! i liked the guava the best and also tried the blood orange , which was also good but not impressive like guava ! the atmosphere is festive and it 's sort of upscale too . we never had to go without a bevvie and also got our chips & salsa refilled as needed . their prices are upscale for sure unless you partake in happy hour ! it can be difficult to park nearby , as is to be expected downtown , and so close to fremont street !
mexican	and for good reason ! always great food , amazing service etc .... one of our favorite places to go for authentic south of the border food ! ! ! ! and the beverages are great too ! ! we will be back . love the enchiladas ! ! !
mexican	the lobster fajitas are amazing ! ! ! ! still ! i like most of their signature cocktails but the sangria just became my favorite . can beat the view either .
mexican	had to have that oyster poor boy again and it 's a winner . make lola 's a must stop on each visit . don 't forget to pin your city on the map in the hall way at the back , if it 's not already done .
mexican	even better . blue margaritas . guacamole . queso . enchiladas with tinga and machaca ( chicken and beef ) . flan . everything wonderful .
mexican	the food is just delicious. everything has a home made taste . the prices are ridiculously cheap . you should give this place a try .
mexican	scrumptious like the first time , and on top of that the passionfruit juice is absolutely amazing here . plus , i finally tried the dessert and i must say i 'm impressed ! the churros and the mil hojas were so good ! i can 't wait to go back !
mexican	the lady i started out with their homemade guacamole and homemade tortilla chips which were divine . she ordered tacos and i had a burrito myself . this place always goes above and beyond to make sure stomachs are properly full . thanks again senor taco ! ! !
mexican	got the quesadilla and sopes ... all were yummy and service is always fast and courteous .. love the free horchata for the checkin : ) great neighborhood family owned business .. also .. they said tommorow they will start to have mole as a weekend special and menudo ... not for me thougb .. lol
mexican	had the perro caliente . oxacan hotdog . this hotdog will be what all others are now compared . get there if you haven 't made it yet .
mexican	great authentic mexican food . as good as last time . very good and fresh food .
mexican	i 'm going to miss this place when i leave phoenix . i hope it 's still here the next time i 'm back in town .
mexican	tasty , warm and i got 4 containers of that wonderful salsa verde . thank you
mexican	this time i tried the mexican pizza and it was delicious . the chicken fajitas are some of the best around . my date ordered the grilled carne asada which is his usual . i love the salsa and they have an extra spicy one if you ask for it . the staff is always attentive and the food is spot on . blue agave is consistent and clean . i like the prices and there 's always a coupon available on yelp or the entertainment guide . if you are craving modern mexican for a reasonable price in scottsdale , check them out . i will definitely be back .
mexican	the service again was very good . attentive but not obtrusive and the fact that our server insisted that my girl order first made the experience complete . we have know done breakfast and lunch , we will be back again for dinner and margaritas . highly recommended .
mexican	my husband had the really spicy beef combo , and i had a chicken enchilada and taco combo .. i must admit , the beef was really tasty . spicy , but not overpowering. the chicken was not really that spicy , they say all their chicken is spicy . next time , i 'll get the beef too. good food , smiling service , clean restaurant .
mexican	don 't let the appearance of the place discourage you really great food !
mexican	food and service again oustanding ! the portions are a little smaller , which we both appreciated . we could finish our supper and not feel nauseatingly full . i had the jumbo shrimp in sarandeado sauce , which is a specialty of theirs . they put it on several of their fish dishes including their baja fish tacos , which are delicious . it 's creamy and savory , but has a bit of a kick . i love it , but i like spicy . definitely a place to try if you 're out to visit the dam .
mexican	always good and made to order . tuesday is $ 1.75 tacos , can 't beat that deal . fresh salsa bar too .
mexican	service was awesome and the food was excellent . everything was expertly prepared and presented as one would expect from big burrito businesses , even at this accommodating price point .
mexican	i usually pick up fresh veggies and fruit which are always a great deal . jarritos are reasonable so i stock up on those as well . i think the prices are great . we buy a lot of meat from the case and prepackaged . i have never been disappointed from the bakery items . sometimes we eat from the grill if we have time . check it out ! don 't be skirred .
mexican	best tacos i 've had in a very long time . very friendly service and excellent margaritas . all priced right !
mexican	and was it top notch . shrimp enchiladas and chicken fajitas the best of the best . cadillac margarita to die for ! a must try place to go to .
mexican	i was waffling between 4 and 5 stars , but when that happens i let the food speak to whether it goes up or down . the food here was fantastic . i loved everything i tasted and being a party of 4 and adventurous , we tried a lot of the menu . the standouts for me were the pork tinga and baha fish tacos . the only thing that 's a miss for me is the extremely loud music . i don 't like having to scream to my dining companions just to be heard . thankfully , i didn 't have to endure the previously mentioned long line-ups .
mexican	borracha has a salsa that is almost the exact same and tastes so good ! this restaurant has great mexican food and although its nothing like you would get in california or texas it is very delicious .
mexican	my wife and i found this place all thanks to yelp . our first time in we not only had lunch , but we ordered more ginger chicken burritos to go . we are back in arizona and tonight we will be taking the folks to chino bandido for a fusion feast . i 'm glad we live in seattle as chino gives us something to look forward to . best eats : ginger chicken pollo diable jade red chicken jerk fried rice
mexican	enjoyed my favorite chicken flat as , rice & beans . location is far out in the west valley and worth trying . very casual , fordable price , and great costumer service .
mexican	last pinata was the busiest of them all with 2 he waits not uncommon . they are still a great place to go for family run mexican food . the machaca is outstanding but i do not believe their story of inventing the chimichanga . agave margaritas are good too .
mexican	the food , the beer and the prices are why i went back the next night . the 5 stars are because our server strongly recommended we stay for the artist / band , shane murphy . man , what an incredibly talented and entertaining band ! we grabbed a spot on the balcony which was a great spot to drink and watch a band from . i highly recommend you check out shane murphy when he 's playing at brutopia , and / or just checking out brutopia when you can .
mexican	even on sundays they 're open til 2a . we ordered the potato brava , their fries , shrimp diablo , the bacon wrapped dates , chicken skewers , and the nutella banana sandwich . the biggest standout was def the dates ! just wow , the saltiness of the bacon , sweetness of the date , and the nut in the middle ... nothing i ate here even compares . the shrimp diablo 's sauce was particularly good as well as the nutella banana sandwich .... i 'd def order the dessert again . but the dates were incredible . don 't come here and not try it .
mexican	the food is fresh and made to your order . the staff is friendly and prices are about average for lad vegas . food is always fresh .
mexican	the burrito was almost swimming in enchilada sauce , and the burrito 's interior was chockfull of refritos and cheese with some strands of cheese on top as well--although i would have preferred some melted cheese . with creamy guacamole and pieces of fresh tomato added to shreds of beef inside a crisp but malleable taco shell , the taco was excellent , except not much guac was included for $ 1.10 extra . service was friendly , and a somewhat complicated order came out exactly right . it was another satisfying lunch at this roberto 's .
mexican	thank you ! i will definitely be in to visit this gem and test it out again . i loved the burgers there , applewood smoked and with avocado ! can 't wait to write a proper current review for this place i love the salsa here , blended and served hot ! it 's probably the best salsa ever !
mexican	best food , fast attentive family friendly service , great prices and portions . place leaves me happy every time i come here !
mexican	had a steak as well as a chicken taco with a side of black beans and a new spicy mix of grilled veggies called calabacitas , both healthy and yummy . they 've changed up the old shredded lettuce on the tacos for a mildly spicy mix of peppers and fresh grated red cabbage , what a major improvement . very pleased , and priced about $ 10 . my friend had the shrimp fajitas and he too was please with both the presentation and taste ( a lot of food for just one person btw ) . our server cortney was on point and made the entire meal a real pleasure . i 'll be back .
mexican	seven years later , it finally exists . located mere blocks away from the house , burrito drive has a pretty interesting and whimsical menu . i 'm not one to care about authenticity and with things like tijuana hot dogs , i 'm not sure how i would judge but the create-your-own burrito i ordered at work was fresh and tasty . my collegue ordered some of the chili which was also enjoyed . a little on the pricey side ( chili and a burrito ran $ 12 ) but getting something tasty brought to me is worth the premium .
mexican	we had fresh great recipes and it was " new " - quality mexican food before qdoba 's and all the big chains were around . the food was fresh , lots of good flavor and unique beverages and treats . well ... pasqual 's ended up in madison and , it 's just as good as i remember from when i worked there . we go for work lunches .
mexican	the food here is amazing and so is the horchata . i always see the owners working here , so you know they are paying attention to quality ! i 've become a vegetarian , and they have a few veggie options which is cool too ! it 's usually pretty hard to find that with mexican food .
mexican	fantastic lunch . this place is close to my place of employment and is fairly priced and the chicken menu is delicious . lunch time rush is a bit much however , the service is petty quick . frequent stop for me . recommend to all .
mexican	it 's close to work , food is really good , always tastes fresh and healthier than most taco spots and service has been consistently good . it 's a pretty basic menu but what they do , they do well . i generally get one taco and a burrito which runs about $ 8 . tried the potato today ( papa loco ? ) . it was good , unique and a nice change but i do prefer the burritos . if you haven 't been its worth checking out
mexican	whether it is taco tuesday or a family pack and head home it is our go to taco joint .
mexican	it is a small place , quite little seating inside and out , but it did not bother me . it is well organized , clean , and the inside is up to date . when i went there for the first time , it was very busy , so if you go here you must go here early .
mexican	there is a beautiful outdoor patio with misters . i had a chicken taco and the crazy potato . both were equally delicious . there is a salsa bar where you can load up with whatever pleases you . the people are very friendly and helpful for someone who doesn 't know one thing from another and the food was served quickly . the owners should be proud of their back yard taco .
mexican	at this location it 's a little bit of a pain to get salsa and stuff ( we waited longer in this line than we did for the food ) , but overall not a big deal . i definitely enjoy coming here when i 'm nearby ! : )
mexican	the unassuming a-frame building cannot properly portray the beautiful simplicity of mesquite grilled meats . the tacos are fantastic , but the baked potato is where it 's at for a hearty dinner . the homemade flan is an excellent finish to a fast but delicious dinner .
mexican	the crazy potato -- crazy good . great service , great atmosphere . i go often .
mexican	we love backyard taco ! their tacos are delicious ! service is friendly and fast too ! we drive all the way from tempe to get backyard taco . their tacos are the closest to real authentic mexico street tacos in arizona !
mexican	this is where all the locals go , so you know it is awesome ! try this place , it will be one of your favs , it 's mine : )
mexican	their tacos are very tasty , sizable , and reasonably priced - something you rarely see in gilbert just because it 's gilbert . the menu isn 't over complicated , they have a great variety and they just added al pastor which is a fantastic menu addition . this location is 10 times bigger than the university location so lots of seating . the patio prob seats more than 50-60 people so it 's very spacious . backyard taco is now my go-to for weekly tacos ! !
mexican	if u crave mexican food go here you 'll thank me later after your first bite . you 'll probably get addicted , i 'm not sorry you 're welcome for making your life better ; )
mexican	these tacos did not disappoint ! i even came back three times during my week-long stay . make sure to try to avocado cream !
mexican	the food was fantastic and grilled right before us . really enjoyed the carne asada and pollo street tacos . everyone was raving about their food . one parent was raving about her papa loca . nice !
mexican	typical robertos but they have a great selection of mexican beverages .. always an option
mexican	had tons of flavor . for sure will eat here again !
mexican	that 's it . you don 't need to really order anything else . but if you did then the rolled tacos with guac or the carne asada burrito are worthy .
mexican	swordfish tacos delicious & the rice / black beans that came with it had a great ancho chili flavor . beer battered fish sandwich very tasty & great chips with it . overall a delicious lunch today !
mexican	magic in ones mouth ! lamb chops are also amazing , actually everything on the menu is amazing . you have to go with a group because you have to order most of the menu and have a bite of everything !
mexican	that is what you must have ! the food here is delicious and the service is great. i love the atmosphere and my favorite drink is the sparking sangria. i can go here and stay for hours to talk and relax. i highly recommend firefly. must haves again the bacon wrapped dates , the chicken salad , the sparking sangria , and the paella .. enjoy !
mexican	tangy and perfectly sauced tierra y mar skewers - amazing steak cooked to perfection flavors meld together with the green salsa grilled scallops - not too great had a very fishy taste to them which seeped into the potatoes when your food all taste the same as the main part of the meal it 's no bueno .
mexican	bacon-wrapped shrimp fajitas. that 's all you need to know. fucking delicious. server jackie was great. guacamole was a little spicy , which was a neat surprise. we managed to come on the evening of some high school 's home coming , and according to my wife , modern homecoming dresses are way too hoochy for decency ; i guess it is a little unusual to see 17 year old gash in public. the happy hour specials are amazing !
mexican	great food and drinks ! food is good portions and top quality ! ! ! highly recommended ! ! !
mexican	everything we had was awesome ! ! ! keep it rad guys thanks ! ! !
mexican	i 'm a seafood fan , and this is a fresh , new twist on some old favorites . the coconut shrimp is excellent , and the fish tacos are the best i 've ever had ( in this country ) . the staff is super friendly , atmosphere is fun , i truly like this joint . if you haven 't been yet , gotta ' try it out . even my non-seafood-loving mother in law liked it a lot !
mexican	get the burrito with chorizo , salsa , sour cream , eggs , ( add potatoes ) , etc. and you 'll love it . excellent toasted sun-dried tomato bagels with cream cheese with coffee . great service too !
mexican	flavourful , moist with lots of meat , reheated leftover for breakfast the next morning , absolutely delicious and not at all soggy .. burrito boyz nowhere as good , unless you prefer soggy sour cream drenched wraps
mexican	so so good , and my boyfriend always orders , calypso shimp linguine .... love bahama breeze my favorite ! very delicious !
mexican	its got purty decor like they got that tropical theme going . they make flaming drinks ! had a flaming dr pepper here . the coconut shrimp is pretty good . like the fans on the ceiling . it 's purty too . makes me feel like when i took the mirsus to hawaii ... well not really it. was mah backyard and my cuzin stu turned on the fan with some salt water to give us an ocean breeze . food ranges from paella - to burgers - and yummy sammiches and jambalaya pasta , woodplank cooked fish and chicken . i think one time i had the conch soup ! i have the conch it 's my turn to speak !
mexican	bailee did an amazing job serving me and my friends we felt very welcome and the street tacos are amazing definitely coming back !
mexican	try the potato tacos , its sliced potatoes pan fried with cheese served taco style . they also have a ton of hot sauce that is always fun to grab a few and try them on different tacos . my only complaint is their fountain drink machine , granted they did fix the ice machine , but sometimes the drinks are flat . just need to tune up the carbonation and it will be great !
mexican	fish tacos rock it , so does the carne asada and the baja salsa looks like coffee grounds or lava but it tastes amazing with a totopo de maiz .
mexican	pulpo a la mexicana taco : the octopus meat was really well seasoned and had almost a smokey taste to it . there was a good amount of meat and the fresh leafy vegg toppings with the creamy sauce complimented it well . overall , i found the 2 tortilla per taco to be quite thick ( even individually ) , there was lots of toppings and seasoned well , but $ 6 / taco is quite steep . the place itself is crammed most times and there was limited seating and no containers for the salsas . i 'll most likely come back to try some more , but i 've definitely had better tacos elsewhere
mexican	also had the real fruit juice ( honeydew ) at the counter ( had real pieces of fruit floating in my drink ) . all were delicious . came back a little while later for blackened mahi and the carnitas and they were good but not as good as the baja or the gobernador ( but still plenty tasty ) . really nice lady punched in the orders / handled the cash register . i am doing a taco run in the city and i have to say that these were better than the ones i had at grand electric .
mexican	baja fish tacos are filled with big pieces of fish. prepare for long line ups on weekends
mexican	the fish is wahoo and perfectly prepared . my friends got a salad that looked crazy good and enchiladas . the enchiladas that i had to taste were steak and fantastic . great slot for a margarita too with outdoor seating and courteous service .
mexican	i loved the salsa bar . happy to have the habanero salsa and other choices ( what , like nine or ten of them ? ) . and the price was great . i 'll be back .
mexican	try it . love it . crave it nightly . also try their veggie tacos . they have this awesome green guacamole salsa that you should put on everything .
mexican	personally , i love their quesadillas . they are extremely cheesy , and they are filled with your choice of meat , with some guacamole , sour cream , and salsa on the side . each one of the entrees have chips included . try some of their salsa verde with some cilantro ... it 's a very good combination . if you really like their food , then buy their " collector cup . " for $ 9.99 , it includes 1 free drink , followed by 99 cent refills for life . a good deal if you come back to this place multiple times . good restaurant , good food , good place .
mexican	loving the food ! do awesome custmer service , and friendly atmosphere .
mexican	not authentic ? who cares ! tastes great to me .
mexican	situated in the courtyard of the office tower in which i work , bf is a convenient lunch option when i 've forgotten my lunch in the fridge at home . i enjoy the freshness of their food and that it 's made to order , and that the workers seem to be constantly cleaning . the salsa bar is always well-stocked and offers a good selection . today i ordered the nacho burrito , enchilada style , and found it quite tasty . it won 't knock your socks off , but it 's a fairly-priced meal downtown that remains consistent . if you go , stop by my office and we 'll dine together .
mexican	but it 's freakin excellent when you 're wasted off your ass ! honestly we ate here non-stop , those burritos and tacos soak up that alcohol and gets you good and ready to enjoy the day 's events . we stayed in tower ll and it 's super convenient to that side ... cheap prices , good food , different types of salsa . oh mi oh my ! chipotle ? chile please ... baja fresh is where it 's at ! god i wish they 'd come to texas
mexican	the company stormed into existence years ago taking over the fast fresh mexican market but since chipotle has been around on a large level over 8 years or so it has " chipped " away at their market . in saying that i still love and appreciate both . and this location has never done me wrong . been there many times and the service is always fast , busy or not ( often it 's quite dead in there actually a little sad ) but the food is always deeeelish ! and unlike chipotle or many other places these days they still give free chips and the best salsa bar around ! try the pico de gallo if you haven 't !
mexican	get them fried or grilled . i come at least 1 time a month if not more . tuesday is tacos for $ 2 any taco you want . i suggest carnitas , fish and carne asada tacos . waitresses are very friendly and do a great job ! weekends you get a chance to see mariachi ! !
mexican	it 's our go-to for breakfast burritos and amazing dinners . it 's authentic , and the clientele reflects that - it 's where people in the area who know good mexican go . the service is always fast and friendly , and the food consistently good . it can get busy for dinner on the weekends , so we often go during the week .
mexican	baja loco : good food , nice staff , great atmosphere , my favorite is the grilled fish tacos , along with the margarita , it makes a great meal .
mexican	baja miguels in southpoint hotel casino is one of las vegas best mexican restaurants the prices are cheap and the food is plenty the chips and dips are a delight always hot and fresh there food is always spot on try baja miguels you taste buds will thank you
mexican	hidden away on the second floor inside south point casino , baja miguels is a good choice for a nice mexican lunch or dinner . when they bring out the chips , they come with a combination of salsa , guacamole , and sour cream . they have some great lunch time specials which include soup , an entree , and a margarita . the food was great and the prices were very reasonable . the atmosphere was ok . the service was above average . overall , 4.25 stars .
mexican	came here mid-day after driving around on the trolley . this place really is great for day drinking - $ 4 bloody maries , $ 7 margaritas and super cheap tacos . fun atmosphere with great outdoor people watching , what else do you need !
mexican	very hot food made to order . friendly service . great chips / salsa / guac / bean dip . awesome churros . we 've tried almost everything over the years and it 's all been amazing . friday / saturday nights have a wait but just sit at the bar and enjoy a drink .
mexican	i love the mango salsa and unlimited pico , hot sauce at the salad bar . it 's located by my wife 's luxy nail salon . very convenient for me
mexican	crispy fish tacos . chicken burrito - chimi style . everything was on point . salsa is killer , chips are fresh . go here !
mexican	i 've gone at least once a week since i found out about the place . their beef is delicious , and i just tried their sweet pork and am now a huge fan of it too ! the only not-so-fabulous thing about bajio is their rice . it 's okay , but definitely not the greatest . everything else is phenomenal though , and you can 't beat the price ; an enchilada with two sides and a taco with all the fixings for $ 7 and some change .
mexican	plus delicious soups , corn and cheese , and the famous locro soup with chorizo or the vegetarian option , a must try . you can bring your own wine for a relax meal . ask for pablo the owner who is likely behind the counter looking after you .
mexican	a total different experience from the other taco chain present here . the food is fresh and there is a great attention to detail . chilled tequila shots with salt already on the rim , bubbling queso ( that doesn 't appear to come from a melted block of velveeta ) , and unique taco options with corn tortillas . looking forward to their patio come summertime !
mexican	the tacos are boring . i haven 't been impressed . if you want good tacos , go to tako down the street ( if you can get in ) or reyna in the strip district . what is fantastic are the salads . bakersfield salads are amazing . great lettuce , great toppings , great portion , great price . i 'm a regular for the salads . the drinks are good . i wish the drink specials were all mezcal or tequila and a pbr rather than whiskey on some days , but it isn 't a big deal .
mexican	nice patio , great drinks and delicious food . we enjoyed an early weekend lunch on the patio . no wait . helpful , attentive staff . we had the fish , mole , pollo rojo , and al pastor tacos . they were all great with the al pastor being my favorite . we also shared an order of the quest which is awesome paired with the green salsa . i 'm a big fan of a spicy margarita and theirs did not disappoint . win for families : they have individual milk boxes for kids which i love because you never know how fresh the milk is when dining out in a restaurant that doesn 't frequently use milk !
mexican	such a great concept with small and healthier mexican dishes ! pros : queso ( add chorizo and beans ) ; guacamole , salsa , chicken chorizo tostada ; premium margarita cons : parking can be an issue , but if you figure out the valet guys across the street it 's actually very simple ; no reservations so be patient and enjoy the atmosphere ; house margaritas could be better as could their wine list . overall their food and atmosphere gives this place an easy 4-star ! you 'll find yourself craving everything on the menu ! !
mexican	just look at the photos - these * look * like tacos you get in mexico or the right parts of texas . cotija cheese , huitlacoche ( mmmm .... corn smut ! ) , cilantro , pickled onions , poblanos .... you pull all the right punches in all the right places .
mexican	nice comfy seating , cool modern decor and friendly service ! their guacamole is nice and chunky and the queso dip comes in a hot iron mini pan . not quite sizzling but browned cheese on top .... yums ! unfortunately don 't serve root beer but they do have mexican coke with real sugar not artificial sweetener . the tacos were great too . loved the braised pork and the mahi-mahi fish taco ( they have mahi in pittsburgh : ) . the steak taco was flavorful and good but i like my meat thinly sliced . overall you can 't lose here ! great food ! great value and nicely and smartly decorated . did i say i loved the guac ?
mexican	great combo . don 't let the address limit you . we visited for lunch before 1pm , and didn 't experience any lunch crowd . plenty of seats . i had a combo ( tamale , taco , tostada ) which was too much food . my friend had the mexican pizza , which i 'll be getting next time i visit . soon i hope . p.s. if you like hibiscus tea , you can get the leaves here to make at home .
mexican	steak , cheese , beans , avacado wrapped up in a freshly made tortilla for $ 4 ! ! ! ! the servers don 't speak english , but the food is so great i don 't even care . the papusas are also fantastic ! i can 't even rave about this place enough . they have salvadorian , mexican , honduran food and so much more !
mexican	this place ! you 'll definitely have to check out lupe 's--great little taco shop that you ( probably ) didn 't know existed . service is pretty much like chipotle ( but the food is better ) --walk up to the counter , pick a shell , meat , toppings and beans or rice . two fantastic tacos for five bucks ! i had the pork and steak both were spot on . salsa selections were also very good . this is my kind of place , simple menu , fun atmosphere , and great service . and hey , you can even grab a beer !
mexican	i enjoyed all 3 tacos that we tried , definitely enjoyed the mahi mahi most but would also recommend the octopus and marlin . they were sold out of the ceviche unfortunately so i would try the next time .
mexican	delicious mexican dish served up by super friendly staff . came by tuesday after work for take out . we ordered the tabasco combo and the mexican combo which came up to around $ 25 . the lady gave us a complimentary chip and salsa while we waited for our order which was super sweet of them . solid burrito , enchilada and chimichanga for what you 're paying for . great staff and service . i will be coming back .
mexican	great service , good prices especially for their lunch special . rice was good too , not dried out like other places . : ) their carne asada tacos are legit tasty . new yorker here in arizona for the first time and i am impressed .
mexican	and they have roasted hot peppers on the toppings bar . every time i 'm in phoenix , i 'm going here .
mexican	perfect for when you stumble in at 1 : 45 am all famished and looking for something tasty just before you head home .
mexican	- bad ass menu , excellent service and killer ... killler ... killler food . not cheap , but not a wallet buster either - worth the time effort and money in my opinion . ill be back . you should go . i almost fell out of my chair when i had the ceviche as well as the pork butt . stayed in it thankfully and ate it all .
mexican	the f-bomb and the chick are my favorites . literally the best falafel and eggplant i 've had , and to add to the deliciousness , they have an assortment of really great toppings and extras ! fun workers too , its a pleasure to stand outside their cart in the cold weather !
mexican	cevichie / cheese dip are wonderful ! everything i have tried is excellent !
mexican	have it in tacos , burritos , tostadas , quesadillas , enchiladas or a salad . whatever it is , barbacoa should be the choice . the fact that it is noted for winning awards initially caught my interest , but after tasting it i cannot stop ordering just this protein . this location is the busiest out of all the them . every time i come , i am left waiting in line for 10-15 minutes . the employees manning the line are quick and efficient , but there is only so much a person can do while waiting for grill room to free up . regardless of minor inconveniences , i do enjoy their food from time to time .
mexican	if you leave without getting the caramel apple empanadas for desert that would be an error in judgement . we had a larger group , but the service was definitely attentive even though it was dinner rush .
mexican	carne asada is very good , but try the barbacoa , you will not be disappointed . this was our second visit and we will definitely be going back . location is odd , but so glad i bought a groupon to try it out since it is close to work . the guacamole fresca appetizer is also super yummy . the 3 salsas they give you are equally delicious , spicy and very unique . the owner and daughter ( ? ) are fantastic , service is great !
mexican	meat is tender and flavorful , great salsa bar w free beans ( black or pinto ) with a cold beer and dinner is complete .
mexican	great family-operated restaurant with quality northern mexican dishes and fun , upscale decor , appropriate for the location . these brothers are hard workers and are serious about delivering quality . i especially appreciated the freshness of the warmly-served salsas , unleashing greater flavors . you can catch me here regularly now for lunch .
mexican	the only problem is the wait they need extra help
mexican	i typically get the chicken burrito with all the extra toppings which comes to $ 7.90 with tax and it is consistently very good . pros : -ingredients are always fresh and burrito tastes great . -never have to wait more than a couple minutes for food to be prepared -all the staff are very friendly . -nice small patio in the back also they have a deal where if you sign up for their wifi you get a free can of pop .
mexican	i 've done the ayce menu and it is amazing . the beef and chicken skewers are hearty with flavor and the bacon wrapped dates are always good . i always get an order of either mojoto or white sangria while coming to this establishment .
mexican	i love the food here . i always have a great experience here . the atmosphere is cozy and the service is great . it 's a bit dark and the setting is very casual . it 's usually quite loud and busy . some of my favorite items are the octopus , bone marrow , and raw tuna . the bone marrow is a must ! i also love ordering some cured meats , cheese , and bread at every visit . i highly recommend all locals to come . it 's a bit on the west in a quieter neighborhood but it 's totally worth coming !
mexican	every dish was perfect from the sardines , to the steak , to the sweetbreads , to the blistered peppers . basque cake for dessert was my favourite dessert all time . service is perfect . try it . you will not regret bar isabel .
mexican	we were a group of 5 people and ordered a bunch of items on the menu . it 's tapas style so it 's the best way to do it . we ordered 2 bottles of wine , ceviche , carpaccio , shishito peppers , sobrasada & foie gras , patatas bravas , half octopus , rib eye and the basque cake . we loved everything ! highlights : foie gras tartine ceviche , rib eye and the basque cake it 's on the pricy side but we were extremely full so at least we can say it 's worth it . the server was very patient the vibe is casual thumbs up isabel
mexican	it was very sweet , very yummy ! - roast bone marrow : the portion was larger than we 've expected - the cholesterol tasted amazing hahaa mains : - sea bream ceviche : it has a lemon-y taste to it - mixed with avocado & fresh fish - grilled octopus : must try ! desserts : - corn ice cream , spicy caramel , walnut crumble : i would order this over and over again .. loved the sweet corn flavour ! ! it 's so good : d
mexican	they seemed to be understaffed every single time i have been there . ordering online didnt help to avoid lines , i had to wait for them to prepare my order after i had arrived . this defies the purpose of ordering online . food is good because it is chipotle and they have great quality ingredients and standard recepie that works . but this perticular location can benefit from some oversight and good management .
mexican	veggies aren 't always the freshest here . they serve old bread . good customer service is hit and miss . they definitely need to give this location some tlc .
mexican	unfortunately , teepee served up overbroiled , dry beans . a 2nd indicator is the margaritas . a drink with patron should have a bit of kick ; the bartender had a second chance to get it right - no luck . caution : very noisy . service was excellent . however , there isn 't much reason to return given neighborhood competition .
mexican	too many good spots in the valley to waste your money here .
mexican	and so i spent the night holding hair as she lost those flour tortillias . they did offer to comp the meal but if you have an allergy that doesn 't cut it
mexican	yelp led us astray . it was absolutely terrible . terrible ! we had the ceviche which was ok ... then everything got progressively worse . i had the tacos- crane asada and pork . the carne asada was inedible- i literally had to keep spitting out bits of meat because they were so chewy . the pork was so dry i could barely choke it down . handmade corn tortillas didn 't help- so dry . cheese quesadilla was bland and served cold . my husband ordered the torta- terrible quality bread- most of his meat was in edible and lacking in flavor . we were hopefully but this was the worst $ 50 we have ever spent . spare yourself !
mexican	adding a drive thru or second order line to a tortoise paced establishment was a mistake . today it took about 15 minutes in the drive through line ( aka the minimum amount of time here ) then i got the wrong order . i go inside . order again after advising of the mistake . guess what ? i 'm in my car again to find i 've been given another wrong order . i could have made breakfast at home in less than the 30 minutes and $ 7 i spent today . could have just tore my money up since i got nothing to show for it . avoid !
mexican	coming from a mexican household , my dad was disgraced by what they call authentic mexican cuisine . i got the steak tacos that were dry and bland , while my sister got a burrito that was cold dry and tasteless , you could tell that the meat they use is frozen . my dad got enchiladas that were a soggy depressing mess . will not return unless they fix the food quality .
mexican	slowest location i 've ever seen , even when there 's no line . never going back .
mexican	the service line is disorganized and quite gross - mixing of utensils , dirty service , prep area , and poor temperature control - food borne illness waiting to happen . upon ordering a brisket sandwich the employee thought it was acceptable to put pieces of nothing but fat in basket to weigh as part of order . when i called him on it , he removed fat out and proceeded to do it again with the end part / trash part of brisket . people in line behind me were as astounded as i was . after that , i cancelled order and left . eat there at your own risk !
mexican	the food was so cold and overpriced ! ! me and a couple of friends were there tonite , we ordered duck , chorizo , al pastor tacos and a havana sandwich , everything was cold , not warm frigging cold . the bartender was nice and warm up some of the tacos . the service was ok the beers were overpriced too , the tacos had no flavor the havana sandwich was so small and it comes with no sides . i really wanted to like this place , but sadly , i wont be coming back here there are better places than serve better hot and tasty food with better prices
mexican	avoid . avoid . i selected herb chicken tacos only to discover that the chicken was not fully deboned . the prices are cheap ; a potential trip to a dentistry clinic not so much .
mexican	my gf described the entree as " chicken helper , " which cracked me up for being spot on . no need to spend $ 50 for two people to eat a gross meal . giving two stars because the ceviche and flan were decent . we won 't be returning though .
mexican	greasy globs of food ... out of some salad items ... slow . i ate at cleo 's at the yard on saturday - there 's a barrio there that i thought i 'd like to try sometime . no way ! what a disappointment .
mexican	horrible service , rude managers who talk bad about you in spanish to everyone else thinking because your white you won 't know what they are saying ... too " busy " to fix the soda machine when your the inky people in the restaurant because they are all wanting to go on break and no one will fix it ( also talking about that in spanish ) . we used to love coming here 3 years ago and let 's just say since moving back we will never come back here .
mexican	the portions are incredibly small for the amount of money you pay . my wife is cuban and besides being completely unimpressed with the quality of the food , was absolutely livid at the tiny portions . we took one portion home without touching it , just to measure , and it was less than a pound of food for 14 $ . the dessert was the same ' quality ' , it was tres leches and about the size of an infants fist for 6 $ . we will actively tell people to avoid this horrible place .
mexican	the worst mexican food i 've ever had . i even ate there another time to give it another chance ( everyone at work raves about it ! ) and still found it disgusting . the beans are the worst that i 've ever had ( you can taste the lard ! ) .
mexican	i bought a $ 10 order for a family member and i wanted a glass of water with it . standard , especially for paying customers . what 's more it is the law in arizona . the clerk rudely refused . very disappointing . the bathroom smells revolting . it appears clean to the eye but there is a sound of a very unhappy vent fan . the food was indifferent . del taco was better . not like nasty but overpriced for very indifferent .
mexican	overpriced and bland food . the worst is that they are really really slow , the last thing you want at an airport . however it is the only place that has a proper seating service and not a fast food joint . i am not coming back . one star is only because of its existence in a terminal where there are very few options to eat
mexican	if you want to wait 20 minutes just to find your order is incorrect or to receive rude service this is the place for you .
mexican	only got as fsr as chips and salsa . the salsa was bland . but i was served a lovely bowl of peppers in oil . ate one and a swallowed a mouthful of horrible oil . turned out it was not olive oil but pure canola oil ... ( rape seed oil ) ... rest of the might i felt likr i had a rock in my stomach . very sick later on .
mexican	only one person behind the counter trying to do everything during busy lunch rush . left after being patient for 10 mins & walked across the street to jumbo empanadas .
mexican	ordered the steak burrito . it was dry and tasteless . possibly the worst burrito i 've ever had . a waste of money , tummy space and calories . boo to you non gourmet 360 burrito !
mexican	quality control is missing from : the physical building , the seats , the service , and the food . i was so close to barfing about 2 hours after having a taco / chili rellano plate . avoid .
mexican	went to macayos for dinner and wanted to sit in the bar to watch sports while we ate . we sat down and there was sports on but no sound . instead it was like i was at a rock concert as the bar tender had alternative music playing and at a level that anyone in the bar area could hear . then on top of that we didn 't get service unless we asked for it directly , no drink refills or chips . i would avoid sitting at the bar as the bartender was more attentive with something other than being at the bar .
mexican	terrible wait times at night . staff appears confused regularly . i gave this location multiple chances . closes before posted times . avoid ! ! ! !
mexican	it 's a rip off , such a shame because their pastor meat it 's pretty good but overshadows the rest of the experience . i
mexican	they tasted like watered-down juice . server didn 't even offer to have remade nor suggested any alternative from drink menu . service was ok but expected much better for a place of this caliber and price . paella was very good--just too oily for my taste . not going back
mexican	they are under different management / ownership . don 't expect the same service and quality . everything used to be ordered and delivered exactly like i wanted . i went yesterday and didn 't receive what i asked for nor was it correct when i did get it . loyal customer not coming back .
mexican	they say they have a drive thru yet i 've attempted on several occasions to utilize it , i 've either had to honk , drive up to the window and wave to get someone 's attention or just leave . i stand all day at work and prefer to use the drive thru it 's very frustrating . i found another one on the corner of nellis and lake mead that actually has a drive thru that works .
mexican	this area is dangerous . none of their food is worth getting mugged over .
mexican	how do you screw up nachos ? we were going to go here for dinner , but wound up killing our first drink and going elsewhere . horrible , horrible place . the only thing worse than the food was the service . and that 's saying something .
mexican	my wife and i always go to the location on decatur and twain . this time we decided to give this location a try and it was a huge mistake ! it took 29 minutes ( i timed it on my fitbit ) just for our server " cesar " to get our order ! we ended up not giving him a tip and the jerk actually followed us outside and asked us why ! i thought that was very unprofessional . so if you want horrible service , than go eat here .
mexican	comically small portions . horrible service . constantly out of critical items . don 't quite understand how you can mess up chipotle this bad , unless management simply does not care . i 'm done with this location . i 'd rather drive the extra few miles to old sauk .
mexican	horrible customer service ! felipe rodriguez ( if that is his real name ) needs a few lessons in customer service . this is , well was my go to for pizza . i accidentally placed an online order at this location while out of town . out of courtesy , i called to cancel the order and he was extremely rude and hung up on me . i tried calling again to speak to a supervisor but instantly kept being sent to hold . needless to say , i will not be getting my pizza here ever again .
mexican	i 've gone here twice , and both times were awful . the most recent time , i waited in their drive through line for 15 minutes , just to get home and realize they gave me someone else 's order . this place is ridiculous and i 'm never going back ... i would advise you to do the same .
mexican	ya it 's fast food , but i still expect it to be at least warm and semi fresh . every time i have been here the food is cold ! get it together " managers . " it 's fast food , not that damn hard .
mexican	i hate this place it 's too bad i like mcdonalds food
mexican	it 's disgusting and cold . last time i got food poison from eating here ! also they forget to give items on drive through .. there was a time i had to go back to drive though simply cuz they didn 't fulfill my order
mexican	- you are easily fooled by the sweet hostess at the front door . from there it was pretty much downhill . the food , to say the least was so-so . the prices were astronomical . $ 10 for a guacamole appetizer ? ? do you know how many avocados you can buy for $ 10 ? you get one . the food was minimally warm . i can see they were having a busy day , but for your server to serve like warm luke food , is unacceptable . there are much better places in gilbert to go if you want food . this is not one of them .
mexican	all cost i tell you ! ! ! even juan avoids this place ! ! i 'm going to keep it pretty simple , walked in with my gf waited 40 minutes after they messed up our order only to find out when we got home i bit in to my burrito it had a large piece of plastic in it ! ! look just avoid this place not worth the headache. don 't be the unlucky juan eating from here ! ! ! plastic ! ! she rolled the burrito with plastic in it ! ! i made this yelp account only to make this review , not a picky dude but this is ridiculous .
mexican	if you do decide to visit , check your order thoroughly ( open up your burrito if you have to ) because we 've had to go back inside every single time we 've visited . the food is okay and some items are quite tasty , the prices aren 't terrible , but a routine visit somehow turns into an inconvenience every time .
mexican	i had some beef tacos and they have to be the worst i 've ever had in my life ! i have never seen taco meat like this ? it looked like they first boiled a steak and then chopped it with a claw hammer and seasoned it only with black pepper . my wife had the steak buritto and encountered the same lousy beef . i went to this place because i was nearby and a yelper had given it 5 stars ? ! ? i can 't even imagine how drunk this person must have been to give it 5 stars . did i already say ? avoid this place ! !
mexican	is the service slow ? well , the water in my glass evaporated before they even took our drinks order . then it was an equally long wait before they took our food order . each time we asked a server for something , they disappeared never to be seen again . ridiculous . the food was okay - standard pseudo-mexican fare - and the margarita was tasty , but neither worth another evening of waiting and waiting and waiting .
mexican	the waitress barely spoke english and you could hardly understand her . she took the order then she was mia she never came to check on us . to the extent that we had to get another server to refill our drinks and get the bill . lasalsa you should be ashamed to be employing such a low caliber of employee ! ! !
mexican	the place had food scattered all over the floor and the tables . the chicken is so bland and flavorless . salsa was mediocre at best . my burrito was really undercooked . super over priced . took us 20 minutes for us to get our food with no one in front of us . will not be back .
mexican	ordered the beef burrito combo ( with rice and beans ) . this was unequivocally the worst burrito i have ever seen . came in a wrap , was so moist it was sopping wet . the packaging started sticking to the wrap and was difficult to separate . chewing on paper , not the nicest feeling . rice and beans were very small portions . combo is not a deal . should have checked with yelp first . my bad !
mexican	the chilaquiles ordered tasted like marianara sauce and we 're so soft and watered down we wonder if they were fresh with little to no cheese . then he had the nerve to say " it 's because your white bro . " we waited 20 min to sit , had to walk up to the front and ask for refills , never got an entree and he had the nerve to argue with us about the food .
mexican	i did check yelp prior to going in and there was only two $ $ so i figured it would be reasonably priced . wrong ! we ordered two margaritas which were ok but nothing to write home about . then we perused the menu . outrageous prices . our baby started getting whiny so we used him as an excuse to bone out . $ 26.00 for 2 margaritas . dinner would have easily been over $ 100 and the menu choices are basic . but hey , maybe you guys are rich ? ?
mexican	who decided to put this place in an airport ! ? do not eat at moes ever and especially if you are about to board an airplane . me and my traveling companion both were sick as dogs after eating here ! we both had the nachos which were less than mediocre and barely warm
mexican	my wife and i decided to buy lunch from this location through their drive thru . i gave my order through their intercom . we drove to the window to pay and after this guy returned my credit card i asked him for something and i was still talking he immediately closed his window - how rude ! their food is not good as other filiberto 's , the lemon they gave me has molds ! save yourself and go somewhere else ! definitely will not go back to this place !
mexican	avoid this tourist trap mediocre re heated chain restaurant food annoying disney esque mexican decor
mexican	go there to have a drink and dance on latin music . understaffed , worst customer service . extremely loud ear buzzing music . we left due to poor customer service .
mexican	went through the drive-thru , was not given any receipts whatsoever & of course order had 3 wrongs items even after they were confirmed following the order . they want me to drive back to the store for a " free replacement meal , " yipee ! ! only reason this franchise is still in business is their location .
mexican	this place is lacking in all areas - food quality was not good at all , restaurant was empty on a saturday night , place is very outdated , and the prices of the menu far exceed the quality of food they serve . my wife and i were optimistic as we love all types of latin food , but we learned the hard way with an overall unpleasant dining experience on all fronts .
mexican	location not open . called the business and recorded message indicates they 're open . tried aunt chilada 's and it wasn 't bad . i won 't be coming back to los dos since they don 't keep their posted business hours .
mexican	ate there twice now and it is way overpriced and not good at all . we got a burrito , a cheese quesadilla and a tiny thing of cheap chips with this weird cheese sauce and it was 20 dollars ! bad food , definitely never going back there again !
mexican	the health code fiasco wasn 't something they ever recovered from . plus they messed it up twice now . great job guys ! not my go to anymore , sadly enough . they opened up a taco joint where they used to be . not bad ! worth checking out .
mexican	bartender was laughing on his phone while we were patiently waiting for our order to be taken . then he wanted me to yell my order across the loud bar to him while he continued to stay on his phone . very inconsiderate . worst tortilla soup i 've ever had !
mexican	sorry i don 't buy into free chips and salsa . disclaimer we went their for brunch ( not dinner )
mexican	awesome food but the place is super dirty , you have to go through the kitchen to get to the bathroom which is pretty disgusting but my food is always amazing i probably wouldn 't recommend it for cleanness but good food .
mexican	drinks a lil 2 sweet that it overpowers the liquior ...
mexican	awesome service , however i only give it two stars because i have now gotten soggy drive thru food from there that was so wet and it smelled kinda funny like it was wet with mop bucket water .
mexican	the worst thing was the verde sauce or what is called their medium . it was unnaturally sweet ? i 'm like what ? by unnaturally sweet , i mean it was like their is sugar added to the sauce . weird and not good . guac good . pico good . everything else i tried was , well just ok .
mexican	the food was bland , the service was a celebration of " i 'm gay , " heres your food . i would not buy stock in this chain. it is as common as brown dirt , and the food is the same .
mexican	absolutely awful . the staff here is outright rude and don 't bother with drive-thru unless you want to keep your car running for 20 minutes while they ignore you . i 've been here 3 times and every time they 've taken excessively long to prepare my order and still got my order incorrect . when confronted , they argued about it . seriously , drive the 2 blocks down the road to the other drive-thru mexican place and save yourself the headache .
mexican	all i can say . horrible service for 1 and the food is nothing special and it 's over priced !
mexican	a lousy version of burrito boyz . service was terrible and the cheese on the burritos wasn 't even melted because they wrapped the burrito the wrong way . all the toppings are hidden behind the counter so you don 't know if it is fresh . while the burritos were large enough , they aren 't yummy so what is the point .
mexican	i am embarrassed they call this mexican , especially when we border mexico . had to meet clients there recently as they selected it , i will say they are consistent . jw
mexican	20 minuets in the drive-thru with an empty restaurant inside . the staff is incompetent i asked what non carbonated drinks they have . the response was all diet pops . when i finally made it up to the window i saw employees just sitting around .
mexican	just a disgrace . these employees have no pride in what they do . and it shows !
mexican	i thought i ordered a whole wheat steak burrito . what i got was some sloppy what-looked and tasted like-processed-cheese-too-much-rice-bad tasting mess . think i have to take a vodka shot just to get the nasty taste out of my mouth . thank goodness i only paid $ 7 for one of those daily deals . for the price you pay here you can go to either big fat burrito or burrito boyz and get something way tastier and worth your money . i do not recommend wasting your money here . two-stars because the service was good .
mexican	service was just as bad as the food . ordered a chicken burrito and had about four pieces of chicken . rice was very very dry . you can eat better at taco bell . so that should sum it up .
mexican	aside from not being able to hear your order they constantly repeat back the wrong order . when asked a simple question they pause as if your speaking a foreign language then ask you to repeat it . this situation happen to me twice in one day and 1x today .
mexican	awful i had a bowl of enchilada sauce for tortilla soup and a salad under my gross cheese enchiladas ! cold taco ! this place is garbage ! run ! ! ! ! nothing family about this place ! gotta puke !
mexican	she 's rude and rushes you . they always make mistakes . the reason i stop here so often is because it is close to my work and has a drive thru . i try not to order something to complicated for them .
mexican	beans were undercooked & tamales were so dry ..... the only decent thing was the beer . would never go there again . asta la vista baby !
mexican	bland flavored food . one member of our party had hair in her food . gross ! ! ! service didn 't come with a smile . the manager who came over to apologize was nice . i will never go back .
mexican	the drinks are decent and the service was good but i can 't overlook the terrible food . i 've tried many other mexican places in the area and this is my least favorite .
mexican	came in before meeting up with some friends later on at the casino . sat at the bar because i was by myself . bartender was clearly irritated i wanted to eat at the bar . food took quite a while to come and when it did it was bland and possibly the driest chicken i 've ever eaten . rolled the dice with a margarita but it was a gross bottle mix , thick and syrupy . didn 't want salt , but got salt . poor experience and will not be returning !
mexican	my kid has a severe food allergy with avocados / tomatoes . she ordered nachos with no guacamole no pico . order came with guacamole . the evil cashier lady refused to fix it and made her order and pay for another one ! we used to eat here at least once / week with 3 teenagers in the house . go somewhere else ! shadow ridge high school students beware . . . little triana could have died there !
mexican	complained to corporate . they screwed up my order twice . food made me sick . tip : don 't order the zucchini batons . they 're gross .
mexican	waited in the drive thru for 20 minutes , heard whispering through the intercom , finally gave my order only to wait another 20 minutes for my food , ended up with the wrong order . never go here !
mexican	customer service was terrible ! the general mgr with the red hair and beard was a douche ! our daughters friend had a finger nail in her food . my husband had a bug in his tea . and our son had a mosquito in his chips ! the manager all but accused us of putting the nail in the food . horrible ! never ever will we return !
mexican	don 't go . canned chicken . horrid margarita . the service was mediocre and rushed .
mexican	do yourself a favor and go down the street to mcdonald 's for a quick burger . not only did they mess up our order twice , the food came out cold . not just room temperature but actually cold . never again .
mexican	gave to the birds . trader jose 's handmade tortillas as really nice and they are soft tasty with few ingredients .
mexican	trying again wednesday ... i am told i ordered the wrong thing ...
mexican	waste of time and money ! rude employee named marisa or maritsa .... we were fine with paying for drinks but wouldn 't take off a disgusting cheese soup . if you enjoy good quality mexican food . go to mangos just down the road from here or even go to taco bell they are even more authentic than this place . never again
mexican	i was part of a large group of mostly out of town guests . we arranged to visit the night before and were assured they could accommodate the size of our group ( 35 people ) . the food was decent but nothing special . the service was horrible . when a complaint was made to the " manager " the service got even worse . overall , there are too many other options in old scottsdale than to waste your time and money here ...
mexican	messed my boyfriend 's order up twice . couldn 't answer simple questions about the food or function on a line at all . rude when asked questions and rude when called out about being wrong . definitely not coming back .
mexican	the food was ok but i was charged $ 50 when i expected $ 32 ! they really need to make it more transparent what you will be paying ! ! !
mexican	first they messed up or order and took forever to get it to us corrected . they issued a refund without asking , cool . however restraraunt was filthy and no hand soap in the ladies room , how must employees was their hands if there is no soap ? ! ! !
mexican	the cheese enchiladas were not even melted and had no flavor . my sons highchair was still filthy after the highschool girl sprayed it down with windex and a dirty rag- i went over it with a wet wipe and it was brown . don 't waste your time or money- totally sub par all the way around !
mexican	there are plenty of other restaurants around with great mexican fare than to eat here . also it took an hour to get our meal for take out on a sleepy thursday night . we would have walked away if we didn 't feel bad for our bartender she is the only reason we stayed and paid for our food .
mexican	there are few kosher restaurants so unfortunately anything goes ! ! !
mexican	waiter kept calling me " chief . " chips are good but food quality and temperature were very poor . really disappointing
mexican	anything else ? i worked by here for a while and some team members liked to come into this place at lunch for drinks . even the cheese crisp sucks !
mexican	food is awful , place smells . would not recommend this place at all . food is made with this lime juice and all food is covered with onions , and the black beans and rice is gross .
mexican	just reprehensible . i feel disgusting and terrible about my life now that i ate that over salted , processed cheese injected , and questionable " meat " meal . service - nice but painfully slow , especially for an airport . the worst " mexican " food i 've ever thrown down my gullate .
mexican	food tasted like a frozen microwave meal . way too expensive for what it was . halfway through our meal , people sitting across from us walked out after finding mold throughout their salad . their quote to manager after she offered to comp meal was , " you couldn 't pay me to eat here . " my thought now ... you couldn 't pay me to ever eat there again ! goodbye chili 's !
mexican	girls at the bar don 't know what they are doing ! they need to be more careful and not give attitude when it 's their mistake and i saw it happen .
mexican	awful , got a beef taquito , and it did not look like beef and had a funny taste and smell .
mexican	half the food bins are empty and they are scraping the bottom to fill your order ! both times i went the employees were arguing with each other . very uncomfortable . next time i 'll drive to the other location - much better service and employees . and they have their bins filled at all times !
mexican	i sent my margarita back twice and finally settled on water . i ordered some mediocre nachos , paid my bill and caught my flight . a few days later , my bank statement included one bill for the nachos , and then the waitress , without informing me , charged the 2 margaritas that i sent back to my card , as well , but on a separate bill . how deceitful ! definitely regret my experience here .
mexican	i stopped here during my layover in phoenix and i was higly dissapointed . i love mexican food but this was disgusting . i ordered the steak tacos ; the steak had an almost burnt taste to it with absolutely no seasoning . the entree came with black beans and mexican rice , they were both also very bland . the service also was pretty bad ; my waitress was very slow . i sat there for 15min before she even asked me if i wanted a drink . i definetely don 't recommend this restaurant .
mexican	i went through the drive-thru and ordered two chicken enchiladas w / rice & beans . i got home , opened the box and took a couple bites & got no chicken , so i cut the enchiladas open and it had 95 % onions & peppers and 5 % chicken ! i love mexican food , but this is the worst i 've ever had ! on a positive note , the rice & beans were good .
mexican	just awful . i took about three bites of my beef burrito and threw it away . flavors were all off . i felt sorry for the staff .
mexican	just awful . not sure how so many people love this place but it was literally the worst " mexican " i 've ever had . i had a burrito bowl with " steak " which looked and tasted like dried up ground beef . i had to force myself to eat it . it 's not difficult to make a burrito bowl . my boyfriend had a burrito and his description is just plain nasty . we sat there looking at all the zagat awards on the wall and i thought to myself we must be being punkd . the employees were awesome but i will stay as far away from this place as possible .
mexican	just disgusting . cold food . not going back . yuck ! ! ! but at least they finally got rid of that chocolate germ fountain !
mexican	just plain awful . i was born and raised in las vegas , and am still a local and i was extremely disappointed . the service was not great , and for $ 16 i expected to have a much better tasting carne asada burrito . the burrito was cold , the carne asada was dry , the beans tasted like they came from a can , and there was barely any cheese . everyone in my group was local , and we all agreed that the food was terrible . the chips and salsa also taste store bought and stale . don 't waste your money . i would have thought that with an owner living in town , the quality control would have been better .
mexican	prices for promo tacos that are advertised for $ 1 everywhere are $ 1.49 at this spot as well . not sure how they can get away with charging more for an advertised promo . took forever to get one taco and side of mashed potatoes . the only reason they get one star is because it has a more modern interior . the employee didn 't even greet me when i walked in . better off going to a different location ! i want to add that i 'm writing this after a few times of going thru the drive thru and not getting the right order . i 've also been told they were out of ground beef on another visit .
mexican	they must be known for their happy hour because the food is awful even the chips and salsa are horrible . i am amazed they are still in business .
mexican	nastiest hot dogs ever ! i love mexican hot dogs . but this place is the worst one in town ! service is ok don 't get me wrong . but the food is nasty . carne asada very bad quality too ! i 've been here 2 or 3 times but never coming back !
mexican	never again . ordered 2 " small " steak burritos which came to nearly $ 20.00 ? really ? tasted worse than something frozen out of the supermarket . no flavor , very bland , tasteless and rude customer service . fail ! !
mexican	nothing like what is advertised here . steak was painfully chewy , the corn tortillas were stiff as cardboard , and their service was unfriendly . the tacos look like they were made by my 3 year old son . not only was the food bad , but my stomach felt like it dropped through the floor moments after the very few bites that i actually took . my stomach hurt for hours after . if you like your insides the way they are and you appreciate good food , save yourself , i would strongly recommend another restaurant .
mexican	not sure it classifies as food . burrito consists of a flour tortilla and meat . no salsa , beans , cheese , sour cream , guacamole . nada . plus they won 't let you add anything to it . everything is as is . the cheese enchalada had cheese but it was not gooey and melted . the food was barely luke warm . service is also mediocre . the salsa was gross . it was super water down . the best part of the meal was my pepsi .
mexican	ordered enchiladas . tortillas not properly prepared . bland , dry filling . sauce lacked seasoning and good flavor . what a sad enchilada sauce . beans were bland and should have been refritos , but were not . cardboard seems more appealing .
mexican	the staff seem miserable but i don 't blame them , they probably deal with arseholes all day . go to fiesta farms or whole foods if you are looking for fine foods without the annoyance and attitude .
mexican	my kid ordered " nachos " & got 35 stale tortilla chips with a bit of shredded cheese sprinkled on top & melted . taquitos were overcooked & tough . fish bowl had dried out fish on top . desserts are served in cellophane . how did this place become a chain ?
mexican	the hostess seemed unsimpathetic to our concerns . but we decided to continue on , the margaritas we had were way to heavy with the sweet and sour . the food came out 35 minutes after we ordered , again for the time it should not have been busy . the server didn 't even apologize and as well didn 't being the additional hot sauce i requested . in short , this place really isn 't worth your time .
mexican	we ordered a bean and cheese burrito and a stir fried veggie burrito . they were expensive and both were 90 % rice ! ! ! when i called the restaurant to complain they told me to order and pay for another one . never buy from here ! ! ! there are tons of great burrito places in toronto including burrito boyz . don 't waste your money or aggravation with this awful place .
mexican	happy hour . not crowded . 4 waters for 2 of us . messed up my drink order . only checked back 2x . took forever to get check and come back to take payment . had to buy extra shot to put in margarita . happy hour margaritas are so weak . food is good
mexican	awful service all 3 times , twice driving thru and once as a walk-in ; items left off order all 3 times ; rude employees .
mexican	every time i go there the drive thru takes forever and order is always wrong .
mexican	awful service and mediocre food , the mangorita was all sugar and had barely any tequila in it , i 've paid less for a better drink in the past , altouhgh i will be back to vegas many more times , i will not be coming back to this terrible restaurant with bad food and bad service .
mexican	when i contacted the restaurant about how i was missing items from my order , they offered a coupon for 2 free meals ( not that i would ever go back ! ) their farmer burger was underwhelming , unseasoned , and cold . this establishment has some major issues ; until they are resolved , i am never coming back .
mexican	the cook handles money in the cash goes back to kitchen and handles food , without changing gloves or washing hands . bathrooms are one of the dirtiest i have seen in my life ! i don 't recommend this place to anyone . sad how entrepreneurs don 't take their business seriously .
mexican	full large margarita spilt on my lap tonight . when i complained that it wasn 't taken off the bill ( at least ... enough years waiting tables myself to know that 's worth a free meal ) the manager said it was because they were short staffed ( ... i 'm not seeing the connection ? ! ? ) . this wasn 't the only incident tonight , just poor service that didn 't want to be there or help us . even though we 've been there a dozen times ( for the food ) , we will now drive past it to hit zapata 's .
mexican	awful service is all i have to say ..... 10 mins for waitress to even show up , 20 mins to get chips and salsa ( which cost money ) after finally ordering , 15 min to get margarita after ordering , 30 min to have ordered finally taken ..... never an offer to refill drink or anything ...... and it wasn 't even very busy yet
mexican	service is awful , food was awful , order was wrong . do not go here , not worth ur money
mexican	every time i go in there , it 's like i am inconveniencing them by placing my order . i am never going back to this place . if you want good mexican in the area you should go to elmer 's , taqueria mi casita , si señor ( new mexico ) , or mucho taco . there are probably a lot more than that !
mexican	nasty food ! got a chicken burrito it was very greasy and expensive . they also charge for jalapeños $ 1 ... the cashier was very rude and the place has a sewer smell to it . do not recommend it at all . however there is a lunch truck a few blocks down 91st and grand they have great service for $ 5 ! !
mexican	our server , cesar did not serve us well and our he was very rude . he did not refill our chips and salsa at all . he was also very slow at getting our or stuff and made our visit very unpleasant . when we told the another waiter they were very understand and apologized for cesar 's behaviors . the rest of the waiters were very sweet to us . cesar , however did not apologize for his rudeness and lack of morale :
mexican	this chipotle is always slow and the flavors are always lacking ! the last 3 times i 've been here they have ran out of a protein while there 's a long line during prime time .
mexican	waited forever in the drive through , get my food home , they gave me the wrong order . had to drive all the way back and the manager at the time morgan was neither helpful , or accommodating for their mistake and sent me on my way . will never go back and do not recommend . to be fair though , the food was good just wish the customer service was up to par of the food .
mexican	they are supposed to be 24hrs ! ! ! i 'm drunk , hungry and pissed off
mexican	was charged for a " combo " that wasn 't on the menu when i wanted was an existing combo with added cheese , i was over charged $ 2 for an unadvertised combo . when i asked why i was charged $ 2 for a slice of cheese , i was told " sorry . "
mexican	sit in the drive thru almost 20 mi utes with only 2 cars in front of me and then when i got my carne assad fries they barely had anything on it and she didn 't give me napkins and i had to ask 2 times before she understood what i said and i also ordered a soda and i ask her for a straw and she said it was in the bag and it wasn 't so i 'm upset i 'm in a drive thru for a reason
mexican	small gnats were flying all over . the floors were sticky and the tables weren 't wiped clean . gross . horrible , slow service . one person working the front end and drive through . i asked for a toddler toy with the kids meal and was told to wait . 5 minutes later , she still hadn 't even looked for the toy . finally she said she didn 't know where they were to come back another time ! i don 't think i 'll be going back to that place anytime soon !
mexican	.. service was so slow our waiter had no idea what he was doing they use very cheap meat and so skimpy on the chips and salsa please don 't waste your money or time with so many other great scottsdale restaurants ! ! ! ! ! !
mexican	terrible ! disappointing ! rip off ! overpriced ! we waited 30 mins for our food . we could have gone to an authentic mexican restaurant & been served faster , better food and not paid this much . portion are small , food was bland , service was terrible . get it together ! or this will be yet another restaurant that fails in the plaza !
mexican	awful. terrible service. very disappointing. go to any other place in the pheonix area theres plenty other quality mexican places that value your business .. the mission is not one of them
mexican	the baked cheese tasted like spaghetti o 's . the food was over spiced or bland and nothing in between . the only thing at our table that tasted okay was the mango salad with the dressing on the side . dressing on side was key , because otherwise it comes drenched . first and last time i go to maria maria .
mexican	the staff was friendly , but i am pretty sure the waiter was on drugs . i am disappointed that the food was so terrible . even the ice tea was awful , how do you screw up ice tea ! the only half way decent thing were the chips . will never go here again and will tell people do not go !
mexican	they used cheese whiz for the nacho 's , the steak was chewy , and the drinks were water down . one member in our party went into the bathroom to make himself puke after dinner .
mexican	this location closes at 1am , or so they say . showed up at 12 : 50 tonight and waited , said hello a few times , two cars in parking lot and no response . guess they close at 12 : 50 and not 1 as advertised . have some respect for your job , because there are plenty of people that would appreciate it !
mexican	this place is so bad it doesn 't deserve 1 star. taco bell is much better don 't go
mexican	took almost 5 minutes after being seated to be greeted by our waitress to take our drink order . ( big pet peeve ! ) then the 2 camaron burritos that we ordered were very large but had only 3-4 shrimp and lots of rice . obviously trying to get away with using it as filler to charge more for less . so havw now tried the restaurant twice to give it a good chance . no more . : (
mexican	food not that great at all , will never go here . servers rude . food not cooked all the way , and people not wearing gloves .
mexican	very unfriendly waiter .... food was a smidge short of nasty . don 't think they 'll be open long .
mexican	wait forever just to be treated poorly & find out they 've run out of almost everything .
mexican	we got the enchiladas and what can i say , they were awful . better mexican places in the valley : valle luna ( 10 out of 10 ) , taco bell ( the one with the chihuahua ) , your grandmother 's cooking ( tamales. tamal in spanish , tamalli in nahuatl ) , and costco brand tacos . ask me if the service was good ? it was not . they messed up my order as well . they get one star over 0 because they comped the one entry of many .... yes i am fat .
mexican	we had a large party of 18 and when we got there promptly for our reservation out table was not ready . we were led to our table and only a portion of us could sit down . the rest of the group stood in the middle of the restaurant while we waited for a smaller table to clear and pay their tab . the salsa was tasteless , the salmon was gross and the ribs were worse . not a fan ! ! !
mexican	worst burritos anywhere . cheap interior . spent all their money on yonge st . frontage and nothing on interior or food quality . save yourself grief .
mexican	ordering was fine but seemed limited but it was cool that they cooked right in front of you . if it were just an in and out taco shop i 'm sure i would 've been happy but when we went to the other room to sit down and everything 's dirty and under construction it just takes away from the feel . i 'm hoping to update this once all the changes are done and it can feel clean and comfortable .
mexican	food tastes nasty . hardly felt like a / c was on in the middle of a phoenix summer 's day .
mexican	this was not authentic mexican food but watered down american-friendly whitewashed " mexican food . " soup was bland , mole was not a good flavor . i should 've just gone across the street . wanted to try something new but was disappointed .
mexican	the only saving grace were the flour chips . the chimis were bland and 90 % dark meat and flavorless . i ordered a chile relleno with chicken . well they piled a chuck of shredded chicken on the top that looked like someone had thrown up . beans tasteless , rice ? red and tasteless . the tea was great . our waiter was excellent
mexican	past few times i have been here , the wait svc and the kitchen have been extremely slow . soup came out lukewarm but i did not send it back because i had waited about 30 mins for.it. bean dip is not as delicious as it used to be , salsa is good but not consistent , fries were cooked in grease that tasted like it needs to be changed . it has changed to a place that 's in a hotel , run by a hotel that expects a captive audience . it 's a shame ... as this place used to be the best kept secret in tempe .
mexican	i was happy to see them back in my neighborhood today , so i ordered the closest thing on their menu , which was a beans and greens and pasta dish . while it was still fairly tasty , there was very minimal amount of anything except pasta , and the beans seemed mushy like from a can . this meal is what i would throw together in 5 min in a pinch ; not what i would buy when out with other food trucks and restaurants around . i wish i hadn 't spent $ 10 + tip on this .
mexican	i 'm a glutton for punishment and for .59 cent tacos . two cars in the drive thru and it took 7 minutes to place an order for 3 tacos . 10 minutes to receive them and the cashier made it seem like i 'm some sort of a-hole for patronizing his place of employment . ugh .
mexican	the service was good as it usually is here but my combination of chicken enchilada and beef taco had absolutely no flavor . couple that with the usual flavorless beans and rice and it was quite bland . how could this happen at a once decent mexican place . did you take lessons from tres pesos across the street ? meh , i am sorry to say that i will not be returning here .
mexican	i will not be back here again ! . she got my order wrong did it again gave most of my food away and i still waited . this is not customer service .
mexican	once again short staffed only two employees on duty mid day today . waited a bit to order . took a while to find one small table that was clean enough to sit at . the rest were filthy dirty sticky needing wipe downs . the trash can next to side door overflowing . the beverage dispenser orange soda basically spitting out orange water the syrup was out same with the brisk iced tea . had to settle for a drink i didn 't want . i 'd recommend drive through but not dining in here sadly .
mexican	no meat in my crunch wrap . i bet they were closing and out of meat and didn 't want to cook anymore . i can 't stand this taco bell .
mexican	back in phoenix and back to mi patio. this time i asked about the refried beans , they are vegan , no lard. had a tostada. it was good but nothing special. margaritas were still cheap and pretty good but nothing excellent about this restaurant .
mexican	but a couple of years ago they changes ownership and the place lost the prestige from back then . it used to be the spot back in the days . plates were full all the time ... you would never finish the plate . but now ... my god .... the increased the prices and they give less food that is bland , no taste whatsoever ... i don 't like 3 amigos so i can 't tell you to go there ... i just have mexican food at taco bell , taste better then at carlos seriously .... sad cause that used to be my favorite spot . chicken chimichangas was the bomb back in the days ....
mexican	service is great . but none of these factors are enough to make up for the fact the food is decent at best .
mexican	new management again and the service is slower than ever before . i must say , i think i 've given this location enough chances . no more for me thank you .
mexican	upon my return to filberto 's a few days ago , i was so disappointed when i ordered chicken quesadilla to-go and received an unappetizing mess . it was a monstrous tortilla shell uncut , folded over multiple times in the to go box . if that wasn 't bad enough , the quesadilla was missing the sour cream and guacamole and had a clear , slimy , rubbery , circular , unidentifiable object inside . yuck . 1 star
mexican	choose from any of the hundreds of other hole in the wall taco shops nearby for tacos that are both cheaper and tastier . if i 'm going to pay over $ 2 for a street taco it had better be amazing and the carne asada tacos i got were dry and the al pastor just average . on top of that , they are always ridiculously busy . not worth the price .
mexican	beef and shrimp fajitas : carne asada was bland , shrimp was undercooked green chile burger : meat was well almost like it was cooked over a propane grille and was burnt , didn 't taste the green chile , best part was the french fries water : was pipe tasting , had to add 2-3 lemon wedges to help with the taste
mexican	paying for the check now ... couldn 't wait to tell the yelpers to stay away . food : 0-stars . the burrito i ordered came out with everything on the side , i.e. guacamole , beans , cheese . only thing inside was rice and meat . yet burrito was closed . what ? ? ? so then it 's a fajita right ? the rest of my group shared other complaints . avoid at all costs .
mexican	food was not great . you could tell they freeze , thaw and then re-freeze their meat because the steak was tough and unevenly cooked where half of it was not at the below edible temperature . also-- there 's no coffee bar . never going back .
mexican	i don 't know how this place stays open. you cant just throw some beans , rice and salsa on a plate and call it mexican. staff is really nice i feel bad they have to serve that stuff on a plate. do yourself a favor and go some place else , any place will be better ! run run away from this eatery !
mexican	came in with my friend for lunch yesterday , we both say thanks and try to make convo with cashier and she just ignored us . then , i found a hair inside my salad . pretty much would say don 't go to this location . won 't be back .
mexican	second they serve blain taco meat with no flavor . they charged me $ 11.75 for 2 tacos with rice and beans . at the airport gouging prices are to be expected . but an extra $ 1 for watered down salsa mad the experience worse . i will never eat here again because the food was disgusting .
mexican	bad bad bad never will give a good review if the service is not good how you can retain customers if i waited to get myselection of tacos from different lines and when i got to my so delicious tacos they are cold and the grease that could be ok is cold white on the plate you definily need a organization if you change it it could be better than king taco but ........... not yet .
mexican	the girl up front was very mean as well .
mexican	we do not go out to eat often but will definitely not go here again . hockey fans were going into the arena , so it wasn 't busy . picnic tables outside were low - maybe set up for a midget and i am short - 5 ' 1 . " waitress was terrible - unattentive - very very slow getting drinks , chips etc. food was less than adequate . do not waste $ $ here taco bell would be better .
mexican	the manager on duty yesterday had very poor managerial skills ! ! i feel like when we are dieting and only get meat and cheese tiny bit of salsa and yet i 'm charged for the whole bowl ! depends on who cashes you out bc one of the guys does not charge me for full bowls when dieting ! ! ! you may lose our business ! !
mexican	torta carnitas and tacos are expensive , salad , little portion . they don 't have idea how is the mexican food with good portions ! the only good thing is the pozole .
mexican	the lady in the front is rude and nasty she doesn 't wash her hands ! she left me waiting on drive thru for an hour at 103 degrees outside ! she was awful ! i don 't think i will ever come back here again ! i love me some good food but i also love me a good service with it ! the food is ok but they won 't work with you if you want to change your order up a little !
mexican	bad bland food looks like it can out of a can from sysco restaurant supply
mexican	bummer , spot looks nice and is in a cool neighborhood . but the mark was missed in a substantial way .
mexican	bad : ( cook dropped his tongs on the floor while we were ordering and then picked them back up and put them in the food. bad news : (
mexican	waiter named hector got our mashed potato order wrong twice. when the food was ready he gave us the food in our hand to put on the table . smh
mexican	but usually the asada fries are good at all the locations i 've tried . i paid $ 10 for a small portion of arne asada fries that was presented like soup , drowned in runny guacamole and sour cream . there were barely any fries . and i kept having to spit out weird pieces of meat . also topped with way too much fake cheese .
mexican	the owner is rude , i 'm assuming it 's lola , if not my apologies to the actual owner .
mexican	unfriendly atmosphere . the young girl serving me looked disgusted to work there and was purely throwing the food on the plate ! not going back
mexican	no social skills . it 's been like that the 4 times i have gone .
mexican	there were nearly 10 employees , 3 customers and the 2 girls at the register were talking and not making eye contact or helping me . i stood there for 2 minutes and they didn 't acknowledge me . disappointing , guess i 'll go to chipotle next time .
mexican	bad attitude to start with .. we asked for extra green salsa and hot sauce twice but did not see anything when we got home , not even regular salsa . basically no sauces , no spoon , no napkin , nothing ... we even asked for it again after the girl gave us the bag of food and she said its all in the bag ... disappointed ! !
mexican	dirty restrooms . dirty dining area . and from the looks of it dirty kitchen ! ! ! ! food came out cold and even though my order was small they still managed to screw it up .
mexican	bad customer service every time i go to they forget my takeout and i always get burnt chile rellenos
mexican	once we finally got it all situated the food was blah .... not even close to authentic , borderline cold , chips were stale , cheese hardly melted . for as expensive as this place was it was not even close to being worth it . wont go back
mexican	i got the steak tacos . they were nothing special . i asked for one more corn tortilla since the tortillas were too small for all the meat and i was told that they come in sets of 3 for $ 6 extra . really ? ? i just wanted one more tortilla that was 2 1 / 2 inches in diameter .
mexican	shrimp is always not cleaned ! ! yuck ! ! be better off and just go somewhere else . food ok , but doesn 't make up for lazy service . got our to go order wrong again . : (
mexican	i feel like my mexican friends can do better .
mexican	they don 't greet you the right way , they act as if you 're taking forever to order . oh and the drive thru . yeah it pretty much sucks . they need a new speaker . food is great . people there are just horrible !
mexican	they got my order wrong then they started talking about me in spanish not realizing that i speak spanish . $ 7 burrito was the size of a taco bell burrito . i 've lived in el mirage for the past 14 years and have been coming to this spot and the one on thunderbird for years . this was definitely the last time .
mexican	bad customer service to the point you don 't enjoy your food and the guacamole was brown .
mexican	very disappointing experience food is just okay but the worst part is their awful customer service will never go back specially after finding out the employee with the bad attitude was the manager
mexican	waited in the drive through line after 3 cars . finally got to the intercom to place my order at 9 : 28 pm . a young female gets on the intercom and while laughing , says they are closed now . all of the lights on the menu were on and the car in front of me just placed their order . i asked how are they closed now and if they knew they were closing , why didn 't they turn off the drive thru lights so i didn 't waste my time waiting in the line to order . again , very unprofessional , no apology at all and i will not be going to this location again !
mexican	more likely just another day . i ordered a classic steak bowl . dried out meat . sprinkle of beans . about 2 servings worth of rice . brown guac . weird corn . all in my burrito bowl . had to clarify the order with the clerk , but once he got it right on the register it was already built without my input on the line . i guess that 's somehow my fault for not doing a build your own . alas , it could have been a good alternative to hamburgers or pizza in the airport . but it 's not chipolte . too bad .
mexican	the guaco is not bad . but the asada is gamy and chicken dry . i dont get what people like about them ..... this place is not overrated , its awful . go to taco guild instead
mexican	couldn 't even enjoy my chicken bowl through eating it . i 'm not a big fan of sour cream but the girl that made my bowl put the shit load of sour cream .
mexican	employees smoking in front of the store while on their shift . employees dont listen when they put your toppings . and fountain drinks are very very watery . i used to love this place but service is just terrible .
mexican	food was bland . walked in , ordered our food and looked for a table . no where to sit , 5 tables were covered with dirty dishes . so i asked the woman at the counter if someone could clean some tables . she nodded and totally ignored my request . i asked another guy standing around doing nothing if he could clear some tables . we finally cleared a table ourselves . the cheese crisp lacked flavor as well as the cheese enchilada . must be using a very low quality cheese . food was very bland overall . margarita was weak and no tequila taste at all . i won 't be back . sorry i just call it like it is .
mexican	they forgot about our table after they brought chips and salsa so we had no napkins , no water no nothing no service for about 25 minutes and it was not busy just understaffed . so i flagged down a waitress who apologized but then was snippy that we were asking for things ( like really , why would a customer group of 7 expect to want to order drinks and food ! ) . it then took another 20 minutes to get drinks which sat at the bar getting watery . this was my second time here and never again . it ruined a good night . the food is pretty good but not great and neither were the margaritas for the price .
mexican	bad experience in this restaurant burrito was not to my order , had to ask them 3 times why there was no cheese. no refill on horchata at this location and they overcharge for a drink. thinking about making pepes my go to place for now on. also called corporate and they seem to not care. not recommended at all , beware ! ! !
mexican	love this place but don 't plan on ordering ahead . placed an order for tortillas and enchiladas two weeks ago and was given a time to pick items up . got there to find enchiladas ready but no tortillas . was told 15 to 30 minutes . 45 minutes later they were telling people 30 to 60 minutes . this was on 12 / 23 and everyone was picking up orders , but to take orders in advance , then not be able to deliver shows poor planning on management 's part . i will no longer depend on them for party food .
mexican	the food is over priced , the portions are small and my lunch tasted like a mexican tv dinner . my husband and i were disappointed and we will not return . you can find better food at the local taco shops for 1 / 3 the price .
mexican	sat in drive through for 10 minutes in line to order a drink and two side orders of chips and quest . after order was placed , sat for another 5 minutes . no " hello " or pleasantries , just handed me a bag . when i drove out , i looked in the bag and only queso was included , not chips ! two small containers of cheese in a bag ! got out of my car and came inside to ask for chips , and waiting additional 5 minutes . employees need some energy and pep , because they seem tired and slow . this was all at noon lunch hour , so management needs to get people motivated , here .
mexican	bad experience with food quality : -dry tortillas ( burritos ) both bean and cheese -dry beans -dry shredded beef ( taco ) -salsas red and green were bland * * place was empty .. should have trusted our instincts when we drove up
mexican	i 'm serious . don 't come here . worst joint in pittsburgh .
mexican	why is the price different when using a groupon ?
mexican	waiter had a very condescending tone when we asked about chips and salsa . he said several times " no , this is the strip " when we asked about specials . ok , i get that but all i asked about was specials . never came back to our table to refill waters either . black beans tasted like they just came out of the can and rice had a very chemical type aftertaste . at least the ahi was goodish . fly far far away from here and go to happy hour at the border grill ( great specials on the strip ... lol ) across the street .
mexican	tortilla soup very salty no sour cream if you want $ 3.00 little porción , acapulco salad add chicken for $ 4.00 and i saw little porción and then the music like metalic rock and and then fajitas bad flavor
mexican	it 's basically canned food . you can 't expect excellent food in an airport but this place is real bad . i was there a half hour ago and already can tell i will blow up the bathroom pretty soon .
mexican	bad service . bad prices . bad everything . most uncomfortable chairs i 've ever sat in- i literally saw a girl fall off these high stools . $ 7 beer , $ 5 taco and $ 5 chips .
mexican	so dissapointed . rude waiter who made us very uncomfortable & rushed us all the way through our meal . the quality of food was very poor . enhilada dish did not resemble anything close to an enchilada . chips were stale and dishes were dirty . i will never go here again nor recommend .
mexican	if you have a hangover and need grease , this is your place . other than that , drive a block and eat at mucho gusto down the street--now that is real mexican food !
mexican	nickle and dime you to death ... used to love coming here , but never again . and when we tried to speak with the manager about it he laughed and walked away ... stay classy jalisco . stay classy .
mexican	chips were stale and cold . but mostly stale . i ordered a combo of a cheese enchilada and a chile relleno and added a hard taco with a side of mole . when the food came without the taco and mole , a different server explained to me that i ordered incorrectly . the food came quickly but had cold spots . weird . i think it was previously made , frozen or refrigerated and then heated ( or not ) and served . so for two sub-standard items , stale chips and a coke - it cost $ 10.63 . i 'm not coming back .
mexican	the chicken quesadillas , tacos , and pretty much everything sucked . not much else to say .
mexican	the food is not mexican at all ! definitely not going back here again .
mexican	service was slow , food was cold , food made me sick , chips were salty .. need i say more ? 1 star because the staff was courteous , but that 's about it . i won 't be visiting ever again .
mexican	refried beans were not cooked , chewy . chimichanga had more veggies than chicken . rice boxed . wife 's enchilada tortilla wasn 't even cooked / heated . service was avg , unfriendly in the bar .
mexican	so get your food and run .. and by the way .. will not return there .. they charge a " fee " if you use a debit card .. did not know til i looked at my receipt since no one at the drive thru said anything .. ridiculous ! ! ! ! ! !
mexican	one star because the music was too loud and our food was reheated.we ordered a five food platter. it was good at first until we at a piece of a chicken leg . the inside of it was cold . we asked for rice and we got reheated rice because the bowl was very hot and the rice was warm . the chicken was reheated because when we picked it up from its black sauce , the inside of the leg was purely cold . if i wanted reheated food , i would go home and look in the fridge . our waters never refilled our waters as well as they sat back and enjoyed the music . we will never go back !
mexican	haven 't been to one chipotle restaurant that has them . very inconvenient . this is a family friendly place except for this .
mexican	bad manager , he talks to his female employee in a not nice manner. i will not go there ever .
mexican	horrible plate presentation ! it actually looked like someone had eaten off of this plate already . the only reason i didn 't give them 1 star , is the sklrt steak taco was decent . skip this place , and go to the mission .
mexican	burnt out servers , pretty much the worst mex food i have experienced in years . bla .
mexican	i had to stop at a store in the parking lot and very much regret grabbing a bite to ear here . i wish i was one of those bulimics and knew how to make myself vomit right now . something doesn 't feel right at all inside of my stomach . why god ... why ?
mexican	you would be better off eating at a taco stand
mexican	it 's hard to get past how unlcean the facility is and the employees don 't look well kept either . i 've eaten here a few times but i 've decided i just can 't go back to a place that unkept . who knows what the kitchen looks like and that 's why i recommend going somewhere else . just doesn 't seem safe to eat food from here .
mexican	what i don 't like is that in response to yet another c health rating , instead of cleaning up , the owner posted an intense nonsensical conspiracy rant on ktnv 's facebook after they featured him on dirty dining . so i will be truly sorry if yayo 's cinnamon-y sweet black bean dip is gone from my life ... but it won 't be because he 's getting ' picked on ' by snhd . it 's because he 's too lazy to keep things clean and in good repair . it 's just the truth .
mexican	bad service and an attitude by the manager will cause this restaurant to close in the next 6 months
mexican	i ordered the chicken fajita 's and the chicken was all dark meat and overspiced . i 've had better garcia 's experiences but i 'm souring on the chain .
mexican	the milton margarita tasted like an old dish rag . my wife ordered a taco salad and when it came to the table it had an inch of water in the bottom of the bowl . to top it off the waitress basicly threw our food down on the table probably was mad she had to serve such garbage .
mexican	we had the carne asada burrito and the casa chicken . the carne asada burrito is just chopped beef with taco seasoning you buy from walmart and that 's about it , maybe it could be better if all the ingredients were in it . the casa chicken was again missing ingredients but much better than the burrito . this is my personal experience try whatever you want maybe you will have better luck . : )
mexican	plus they were the smallest i have ever seen ! server doesn 't offer any extra service at all i ordered a coke she brings me an empty cup and points at the coke machine ! ! ! really ? ? ? it would of taking 10 seconds to fill and would of gotten a bigger tip , oh well i guess , off to the next one !
mexican	expected more from such a supposedly good chef . chili relleno seemed like it was put in microwave . enchiladas were bland . expected more . will not come again .
mexican	had been looking forward to coming here and what a bad experience . the chips oil was rancid . the salsa only sour taste .
mexican	my receipt and bank statement do not match . do not recommend this location !
mexican	bad drinks . bad food . go to the one in cancun instead . no comparison . this place should not have the senor frogs name .
mexican	can 't seem to get anything right . first i couldn 't get anyones attention , and im sitting at the bar . it was hard to get a drink , even harder to get a menu . my side of guacamole for the chips never came my food.order was wrong and when i explained that , they looked at me as if i am crazy ! ! bottom line this place sucks .
mexican	didn 't get what i ordered & they didn 't make it right . overpriced meal ! won 't be back !
mexican	cashier named peachy was awful and had major attitude . definitely was not a peachy person . my order costed $ 5.05. when i gave a $ 10 , she was angry i didn 't have any change . repeatedly saying " do you have anything ? ? 5cents , 10cents , 1 dollar ? ? ! " in an angry tone . stunned at her attitude , i politely stated " no . " i don 't think she thought things through when she stated if i had a dollar in change either anyways . terrible service .
mexican	cheapo management . overpriced . full restaurant lunch ties . only 3 servers .
mexican	over priced . small portions . the only " good " thing i liked was they make their own tortillas . i would like for the owner to be aerate of the horrible management that their store has . after all they spent a lot of money building that place for some punk to ruin their investment .
mexican	there are other venezuelan places in the city that showcase the typical flavours on a better way and at a right price . again , service was awful .
mexican	first time i 've spent 2 hours in a restaurant for eating 3 tacos ! ! also got a shot of mystery tequila in a broken glass ! ! ! ! ! i would give zero stars if we 're possible
mexican	bad service , food isn 't amazing and also 1 / 2 pound calamari for 10 $ when you get 6 pieces are you serious ?
mexican	they have a bad attitude about service to customers. the service would have been nice if they gave extra effort to make your dine-in experience better . just rude and the don 't listen to what you ask for when you order. very poor and less than what you expect at other chipotle restaurant locations .
mexican	had to ask for salsa three times . guys next to us came in 10 minutes after we did and got served first . we walked out and won 't go back .
mexican	place is empty we were the only customers , now i know why . food was over priced , bland and cold . definitely not coming back .
mexican	also , i found out that she didn 't even give me some napkins ... the foods alright
mexican	bad service , long lines , food ok , not good enough to make big lines , some rudeness from the people in the kitchen , not enough space , definitely they need a bigger space and more workers don 't recommend if you are starving , takes more than 30 min to get to the front of the line
mexican	the cashier was texting when we approached and kept finishing his text before greeting us . huge no no . he shouldn 't even be texting on the job in the first place , but if he is going to text then he should put down his phone immediately when customers approach . this glaring error in basic customer service is costing the restaurant most of it 's stars .
mexican	went through the drive thru and did not get my complete order . had to get out to correct it and they reluctantly gave me my food no apology at all whatsoever . sad
mexican	my 3rd time at this location , i want to like the place . always have to wait , the food is not as good as mesa drive location ( the original ) rosa 's ! mckellips location is better in service and the food is better . i will not be going back to higley and guadalupe tia rosa again
mexican	my food was sitting wrapped up on a counter for five minutes while i stood there watching it being ignored . i won 't go back . the food was just ok , pretty greasy .
mexican	sucks that i made this place my # 1 for fast mexican food
mexican	however , simple drinks for men are $ 11 and up .
mexican	ok food . i had their shrimp mexicana . there 's barely any shrimp in it . way expensive for the food .
mexican	mexican rice is from a box ; waitress didn 't even smile ; restaurant is dirty ; menus are falling apart ; complimentary chips & " salsa " is the shrimp cocktail stuff ( not salsa ) . order was wrong " no pico " was interpreted as " let 's jam pack this burrito with pico . " * oysters are good though . this place has gone downhill my friends .
mexican	bad service : out of five available employees , one is cooking , one is taking orders and the other 3 are chatting while there is a huge line of people waiting to get served .
mexican	i will not visit again . i hope this is the right location in the airport because that is the one i am basing my review on . staff was rude , short and did i believe everything they could to get me to post a bad review . mission accomplished !
mexican	rude cashiers . the only reason i go there because they have good chicken casadias . i was there yesterday and they messed up my order . i will go there not to often . they need to work on their service a lot .
mexican	sat at the bar and had to flag the bartender every single time for every little thing ! ! they both just kept walking off and hiding in the back . the food is good but the drinks are watered down and weak . the guy closed me out because new shift came in , i found this to be strange and somewhat rude , but was told it 's normal . i do not plan on returning .
mexican	come on mcd 's . 1st off they couldn 't take two separate orders in drive thru , so had to go inside . once inside my order which was a big breakfast and oatmeal took way to long to get . then to top it off i ask if there was salsa i was told it was in bag . and it wasn 't . plus not fork . get ur stuff together ...
mexican	the enchiladas were some kind of red sauce the tacos suck , tripitas learn to cook them people . the chips at least are fresh . come on now if you have a family restaurant cook like you want to keep customers .
mexican	tasteless food with too much salt ! i guess they are striving on guests from out of town in the nearby hotels .. will never be back ..
mexican	ordered a mocajete de mariscos . the crab legs literally did not have any meat . ordered extra octopus and i had to fish the teeny tiny bit of them out . overall the dish was flavorless . i waited until after paying the bill to tell our waiter about the terrible dish because obviously she did not cook it . she agreed , yet did not offer an apology or anything at all . lol so horrible . do not recommend this place to anyone .
mexican	i asked them which orders were what and they looked and said they didn 't know don 't you so they didn 't mark the items at all so my family and i spent 15 minutes trying to figure out which was ours ! this restaurant need to take notes from the one on warm springs very perfessional !
mexican	the girls that are order takers weren 't friendly . no hello , thank you or have a nice day . so f 'n rude . the chicken with quinoa that i ordered was bland , portions were small for the $ 15 i paid . this place is overpriced for the quality and service you get . go to cafe rio and get a chicken salad for $ 10 and it 's good enough for 3 meals . plus their service is better and food taste delicious .
mexican	bad service , their attitude was worse then the service ... two different ppl keep takong my order so they got the order wrong .. but who wonts to wait even longer for some food after you received your order wrong whats tge point of the read back ... taco bell corporation would like the way this place give service now i cant eat at any yaco bell again receit was not given so cant contact the corporate with my complaint and she wouldnt reprint it for me
mexican	they pick and choose who to give exceptional service . ripped my burrito and dumped the insides into another wrap . i know it all gets digested in the stomach anyways but " presentation is everything ! "
mexican	took long time to take order . food doesn 't taste good . i ordered veggie fajita and veggies were just steamed . no spice nothing . not going to come again . avoid .
mexican	bad service waiter disappeared and didn 't come back had to find the manager to order more food very disappointing
mexican	waiter was rude and obnoxious . we never got refills on drinks or salsa . the menus were sticky . fajitas came out w literally one tablespoon of cheese .. we live in wisconsin ! ! ! the chimichangas were on point though .
mexican	we asked repeatedly to turn down the music , even to the manager . they did for around two minutes , and turned it up again . does the manager not have control of his staff ? when our food came , half was either cold or messed up . the food is expensive for what you get .
mexican	went for lunch on cinco de mayo . saw there were specials , prizes , balloons ... but our waitress never mentionned any of the specials . we found out only after placing our order . we were offered a free tamale because it was our first visit . they forgot to bring it out . got it when the meal was almost finished then they charged it on the bill . the waitress barely came to our table so no way to refill drinks or get extra napkins . food was mediocre . i am dissapointed because judging by the crowds i 've seen there i expected excellent food and excellent service , neither of which we got .
mexican	so get in second line i order they give me the tacos for one variety meat i ask about the other tacos i had ordered they tell me to go next line and tell them what i want . that the most stupidest idea of ordering will not go there again i also told all my coworkers about it , they said they will not go there some have experience the same drama . also they 're not that good neither it 's so so ,
mexican	i wanted to like this place but it 's just a pretentious wannabe taco place . but the margaritas are good
mexican	what else can i say . if you come here for alcoholic drinks , probably okay . but this place is no better than any mexican fast food . well , maybe better in the sense that you get to sit down and have your food served on a plate . we just had to try it out as we had a coupon and the parking lot is always packed . needless to say , it was disappointing . this place is overhyped .
mexican	bad sport chipotle asked me to wait outside for 5 minuets before they opened very rude 100 plus degrees out n your doors were open lock your doors if you dont want people in there with you before hours .
mexican	stay away . unless you like dry chicken and empty tacos . go elsewhere . not worth what they charge . better off staying hungry .
mexican	the restaurant is located a bit far from the strip with strip prices . located among pawn shops and alike we got a bit scared but the good thing there is a parking in front of the restaurant . the prohibition like ambiance is kind of cool and you feel part of a boardwalk empire episode . you expect james gandolphini or joe pesci showing up at any time . if you are budget conscious you 'd better ask for the price of he cocktails before you order . we only took appetizers and no entrees but the cocktails were half of the bill and it wasted our entire experience . the food was ok and the bread was really dry and old . disappointed .
mexican	i was surprised they don 't serve chips and salsa to munch on while your food is prepared . if you want to hear music you have to pay for it at the itunes box . will never come back or recommend this place .
mexican	these guys can 't even make a combo of 3 taco supremes . one taco was beef and tomato on an old taco shell that i 'm sure spent time on the floor . the imature girl at the window was a giggling idiot .
mexican	other locations give you a nice amount of food for your money .
mexican	three times i ate here . three times bad food & drink , and lousy service . funny how one restaurant in a chain can fail when a different location is so much better . i have had a completely different experience at the shadyside location . i mean , mad mex food is marginal even for tex mex , but , the highland ave store , at least , made it look all right and had decent cocktails and attentive service . i know what to expect from mad mex and this store doesn 't even clear that so low bar .
mexican	very bad . ordered a combo : sour cream enchilada , taco and tostada . the shredded beef in the taco was harder than jerky , the enchilada was an oily mess and the tostada was soggy . you can tell a lot about the type of food you are going to have by the salsa . true to form , the red sauce tasted like canned tomato sauce and the chunky sauce was about 80 % jalapeno and no flavor . there was a strange smell in the restaurant and i couldn 't wait to leave . i will not be back
mexican	manager or that dark skin lady such a b * second time i go in there and her attitude is horrible ! ! they messed up my order and i tell them and they get mad ?
mexican	no such special as fajitas for 2 at $ 18.95 . beware website promotion ! food not very good . will not return . too many mexican options nearby .
mexican	the size of my thumb . $ 3.50 each ? ! the tortillas were awful . service was horrid but she was nice . can 't beat the 5 for $ 5 street tacos , but again , tortillas- no bueno . won 't be returning .
mexican	the burrito size is shrinking , and the price is growing ! wtf ! did they think i wouldn 't notice ? i still like their burritos , i just don 't think it 's worth it now . i can get a much more filling burrito from my friends at chipotle for less $ . oh and i normally like mango salsa but this time theirs tasted like dookie .
mexican	queso appetizer great ! nice ambience and decor . service slow and short of attention . had to wait for anyone to come to table . still waiting for containers and check and its been 15 minutes . better service would have gotten them more stars because the menu is fun . not likely to return .
mexican	on my way back home from a vacation to mexico city i had to catch a connecting flight at phoenix international airport . after a long day of traveling i was starving . with not much time to catch the next flight and not many food options at terminal b gates 1-14 , el bravo seemed like the best choice . a taco salad seemed like a good transition from vacation to reality but it was mostly a reality check . a fried flour tortilla shell with a few shreds of lettuce , a meager scoop of salsa , guacamole and chicken and a ton of absolutely no flavor for 10 dollars ? i need some tequila to help me forget this experience .
mexican	you pay extra $ $ for kosher - subsidizing the expensive kosher certificate , basically . beef blt and smoked meat - both very greasy , tons of fat - which is ok when you have a melting smoked . the rendition i had was stiff . place is packed but when the people line in the door both quality and service go out the window .
mexican	hostess was clueless . 1 ) first told us there was no reservation 2 ) told us we have to wait for a table after finding our reservation 3 ) we mention our friend 's have arrived and she said we were the first of the party to be here 4 ) walked past her and found our friend 's sitting down under our reservation . you 'd be better off going to any place on spring mountain or roberto 's
mexican	had the chicken enchilada with mole sauce . fair but not exceptional .
mexican	family of 5 and 1 ate their meal . the twist on mexican isn 't a good twist .
mexican	limited menu and poorly run knock off of big fat burrito and not even close . the only mexican was the man cleaning the windows .
mexican	this place is for yuppies . margaritas were $ 9.50 but luckily we went monday and they were $ 5.00 . very weak pour . hostess was uninterested and sat is at a dirty table . charged for chips and salsa- chips were stale . guac was good but $ 9.00 ! ! ! not worth it hardly any veggie options . food was decent but so unauthentic . i 've had pb & js in tortillas that were more mexican . service was below average . nice waitress but seemed to be too busy . i felt like a sucker for paying for this place . will not be returning . $ 45 for two people- nope .
mexican	they have a captive audience in state government workers given the lack of restaurant choices in the capitol area and perhaps that explains it . the food is generally fresh but offers little in the way of taste . the red sauce they use has a distinctly " off " flavor . everything is very greasy even by the standards of mexican food . this place is a cut below the isbertos , rolibertos etc. that are everywhere in the valley . the staff seem to resent your presence . to call them unfriendly wouldn 't do it justice . i 've waited forever for the food to come and then had the barely warm food almost thrown at me . give this place a miss .
mexican	i 'm giving it two stars because it didn 't come back up .
mexican	small portions cold employees especially the hispanic manager who had an attitude about giving me more thank 3 napkins . no wonder it was a ghost town in there at 3 pm on a monday . they need better staff
mexican	the most pricey and pretentious mexican food i 've ever not enjoyed . bad service , craptastic food-stay away from the pork- and cost too much even for vegas . i 'm on a roll ............ 1 star . ding !
mexican	why are humans so lazy . just because i 'm held captive in terminal c , it doesn 't mean i deserve to eat dog food .
mexican	stopped in for their $ 0.99 margaritas . the expectation wasn 't high because it 's $ 0.99 , but it was still pretty bad . the husband got a beer , which for hh , came in a small glass and tasted light watered down coors light ( it was supposed to be a mexican beer ) . granted , the beer was only $ 2 , but we 'd rather pay $ 1- $ 2 more for a better beer at other hh spots . the bar itself looked a bit grimy which deterred us from ordering any food . in addition , the food that we had seen at other tables wasn 't appealing . well , i satisfied my $ 0.99 margarita curiosity !
mexican	and there 's not even a warning ... just some idiotic " our famous barrio browns " in the menu description . wake up and fire some ceo 's please and fix your menu . also the food was horrible . $ 30 at the airport for two breakfasts that weren 't even as good as mc donalds or burger king breakfast . you people should be ashamed . i didn 't know that it was even possible to screw eggs , bacon and hash browns up this bad . my advice would be to avoid this place at all costs . a microwave breakfast burrito that has been frozen since abraham lincoln was born would be better . run for your life .
mexican	the restaurant itself was not inviting . the echo made the place feel cold , more like a storage room . the food was utterly forgettable . bland and boring . i am not that hard to please and this food failed on every level . the server was attentive in the beginning but after the entrees were dropped- we were forgotten . we finally found someone to help us and got the dessert to the table and even that was gross . which i find unbelievable . the positives : the bathroom decor is very cool . the margarita was the best i have ever had . and i do not say that statement lightly . it was awesome .
mexican	it was different and the service fine but the portions teeny and the prices upscale . we laughed when our order of two tacos was delivered on a plate about 3 " in diameter at a spendy price . they were good but aaron sanchez i think would have giggled . french fries ( wow fries not beans ) were a little underdone with the chille relleno " sandwich " ) i ordered . it just had a big fat hot chili on top of it ) . even the waiter said he didn 't eat the chili and neither did most other people . sorry we paid for it . okay if you are not hungry and don 't crave real az-mex !
mexican	food is bland and service is not at par with its ambience . .. for mcdonald it would compare .. whaaa so sad i miss 83rd grill : ' (
mexican	do not get the tacos . they were so small the table laughed when they brought it - we thought it was a joke , looked smaller than an appetizer . they had numerous items on the menu that were not available and the waiter was pretty rude . with all the good restaurants in the area , dont waste your time or money at barrio queen .
mexican	given the limited options in d gates i have given this place no fewer than five tries . significantly overpriced for poor quality food is a pretty good summary . i even got sick one time within 20 minutes of eating . i wish d gates had better options , but i am guessing barrio will be replaced in 2014 .
mexican	but this location has the worst customer service . i do not recommend this place to anyone , i prefer going to the one on brown .
mexican	barros maricopa food quality could be better floors and tables are filthy i half of the is old radio shack building very hot the other side is both side building needs major cleaning .
mexican	barrio anyone ? i guess the chips were worth one star . the tacos were just bad !
mexican	she was great . he was rude . also pigs head ? it 's pork mate . it 's shaved pork .
mexican	don 't know his name but he is middle aged white guy that works nights . he is sassy and he must think he is so great and everyone else is beneath him . i would rather east somewhere else than eat at this chili 's .
mexican	awful drinks . food isn 't much better . bf ordered " texas burro " -was supposed to be ground beef but they cut it with chorizo ; cut the lettuce with cabbage . not recommended even though it 's cheap . you get what you pay for . - _ _ _ -
mexican	3 times i had to ask what beer they have on tap after he gave me a menu that doesn 't list what beer they have and then gave me an attitude moron should be fired . i will never go there again and will bad mouth to everyone i know
mexican	too bad , because we have lived in the neighborhood for 3 years now and need a late night spot for good food .
mexican	chips and salsa were so not authentic . i won 't ever go back
mexican	avoid the chorizo tacos w / rice and beans . not really worth the money for the quality against price . great location ; very average food .
mexican	bean dip is delicious but i don 't think so when you add boogers to it .
mexican	the health department is around for a reason and , if this restaurant rejects their standards as too " institutionalized , " i can 't imagine wanting to give this place another chance . as i stated , if the violations were silly ones , like not having their letter grade displayed in the exact place specified by the health department , i 'd overlook the grade . unfortunately , this restaurant appears to proudly flout safe food-handling procedures and they 're extraordinarily sanctimonious about it . listen , yayo taco , i 'm not in cahoots with " the man . " i just don 't like food poisoning .
mexican	i ordered the overpriced " carne asada " burrito ( $ 8.65 w / tax ) and i would be shocked if it was even 20 % carne asada . it was loaded with so much beans , rice and pico ( no guac ) that you couldn 't even taste the overly chewy carne asada .
mexican	service was good but that was it ! 7.95 for a half dozen tamales . you get what you pay for ! they were dry and chicken was tooooo spicy . a one time thing ! ! ! tried beef , chicken and chili !
mexican	i ordered nachos for them and i ordered 2 pupusas . the " nachos " were chips with beans on top and a melted processed cheese poured over the top and some canned , pickled jalapeños and runny sour cream and imitation guacamole . even the kids didn 't want to eat it . the pupusas were ok ... the picked cabbage was bland . if you 're used to authentic salvadoran food or good mexican food , you will be very disappointed . i won 't go back , that 's for sure .
mexican	the costa burrito was incredibly greasy and one of the worst things i 've ever tried . the gringo was ok . as others have mentioned the rosemary potatoes that were actually cooked were quite good . the cinnamon roll was very tasty so it was not a complete loss . the staff was also very friendly . the combination of subpar food and high prices will keep me from going back .
mexican	the large majority of the food ( rice , beans , tamal , and enchilada ) was bland , even the chile relleno was pretty unappealing . the fajita chimichanga tasted like chinese food . i smothered everything in salsa and jalapeño cheese dip , which helped , but it should be delicious enough on its own . i 've had much better at the same price .
mexican	had the carne asada burrito with rice and beans . carne asada had almost no flavor or char ( appeared to be boiled ? yuck ! ) which they attempted to mask with guac and pico . beans and rice were sub par and bland as well . meal came out in the time it took to fill my soda , which isn 't a good sign . if you want good , quality , flavorful mexican food look elsewhere . the only real positive is that it was fast and inexpensive . i won 't be coming back .
mexican	what a disappointment . chicken in the taco was dry , bland , and tasted old . one friend 's enchiladas showed up at the table plain with no sauce . she had to ask the waiter for the sauce . another friend 's plate came without rice that was listed on the menu . the rice never came even after she asked the server . i am done listing the negatives . the view from the restaurant is great if you don 't mind bland food or pay for food you don 't get . there are many good mexican eateries in the las vegas valley but lindo is definitely not it .
mexican	felt wonderful and warm inside with strolling mariachis and a festive mood . service was impeccable ! unfortunately , the food was only okay . it seemed that much of the menu is served " fajitas style " ( my words , not theirs ) and the shrimp , peppers and onions were nothing special , plus the portions i thought were small ( eight medium sized shrimp ) . no " knock you over " flavors in this dish and the best thing about the meal was the wonderfully done rice . won 't repeat as my disappointment will not go away any time soon .
mexican	the one thing about the reviews that was correct : service is not great . here 's the simple lowdown : food is a solid 3 chips and salsa were decent - chips were nice a warm guac sucks - its the kind that they make every so often and put in refrigerator ( try los somberros or bario cafe for real gauc ) taco - good flavor on the ground beef - but taco was luke warm , like it had been sitting 10-15 minutes food smell - i 'm not sure if this was because i read on previus review ... but i did notice a wierd smell to the enchilada .
mexican	i ordered 4 tacos , 2 carne asada and 2 pork . the meat was hard and felt like i was eating bone fragments on my first bite ! i had to spit them out . i tried one of each and lost my appetite . extremely disappointing after reading all the rave about it . there 's too many other places like manuel 's or macayos that are guaranteed to hit the spot . unfortunately , i will not be back . maybe it was just my luck . there is a chipotle down the road from this place i 'd rather spend my money .
mexican	we had carne asada tacos and there was almost no flavor at all . plus , two of the tacos had big pieces of gristle that were unedible .
mexican	i ordered tacos which consisted of some unidentified beef goop as a filling in soggy shells with a weird non-mexican kind of flavour ... not cool .
mexican	chicken was " ok , " but not fresh - was taken from some heat lamps it was sitting under . no bread available , though it was advertised on the menu . i don 't mind eating at a dive if the food is great , but this place was just a dive , without the great food .
mexican	the food was okay but nothing special . the salsa was really bland - ranks as probably the worst salsa i 've had . the flavor of the enchilada and burrito i ordered was okay but lacked something . nothing to do with the food but they were playing puerto rican music videos on tv 's and some were borderline inappropriate ( entire screen filled with barely clothed women 's backside shaking ) . not something i want to see while eating ( nor my kids if they were with me . i was eating with a mexican friend who told me they were puerto rican videos . with other mexican food options in the area i will not be back to this place .
mexican	i went at around 11 , so it wasn 't super busy but while my food came fast , i hardly saw the server . that may have been a good thing , because i struggled through my meal ; the chicken rolled tacos . i love nothing more than a fried tortilla , but these almost cracked my teeth they were so hard . on top of that , the chicken did not seem at all seasoned . the red salsa and beans saved the meal . i picked at the dry-looking rice . i will never go back , except maybe to get the cheap margaritas . i 'm thinking the meal would have been better with a couple of those under my belt .
mexican	the only one worth trying is the pulled pork . mind you for 10 $ for 3 it 's a good deal , would i eve go back ... nope ... but good if your passing bye . guac was very lemon tasting and was almost fluorescent green .
mexican	nice décor . service was good and friendly ... it 's not the servers ' fault that the margs were just ok and the only food worth eating is the chips and salsa . steak tacos were ok , but we certainly wouldn 't go back for them . we also ordered one of their signature dishes -- flank steak wrapped around a stuffed poblano chili -- and it was bland and tough , and the accompanying veggies were mushy . worst item we had was the queso fundido -- i 'm pretty sure it 's watered-down velveeta with yesterday 's taco meat thrown in . and it 's pricey . we definitely won 't be back .
mexican	basically another filaberto 's type with lower quality foods , smaller portions & a lot higher prices
mexican	2pm on a saturday ? it 's just a mediocre , overpriced burrito i could have gotten a filly-bs . sorry , not really a huge fan .
mexican	this is an airport , therefore expectations are way lower . still , this " airport scale " of one star ( which would be negative in the outside world ) is fitting .
mexican	hard stale rice at that ... this use to be the g.o.a.t chipotle . now the food has gone down hill and the service too . unfriendly staff ... this has been going on for the past couple of months . fix it ! i want to love you guys again ! lol
mexican	the difference ? the prices . they got rid of their cheaper specials and the menu prices are i n s a n e ! if it was home made , delicious , authentic mexican food then maybe . but what they are giving you is a food prep area filled with precooked foods and thrown together some time after you order . nothing is really " hot " but rather warm 'ish . slow service , mediocre food and high prices . nexttttttt !
mexican	the staff was rude and they are super cheap with their drinks and chips / salsa . maybe i 'm just used to the great service and food at emilianos . the food looked like a bunch of slop and when someone at my table asked for double meat on their tacos they were rude and said no because the meat is already portioned out . ok ...... so you don 't want extra money for extra meat ? weird .
mexican	i had the beef burrito . found the beef to be flavorless . the big tortilla was nice . there were no authentic flavors / spices jumping out . its not surprising alot of people on here like the place , the food is bland and predictable , it is very americanized mexican food . for a chain mex restaurant , chipolte beats this place .
mexican	i do not recommend eating here . that being said the atmosphere and design are great , nothing like it very cool spot . also , cocktails are decent .
mexican	nothing too exciting on menu . food served without garnished or anything colorful on plates . very few diners . lovely space for hopelessly underused .
mexican	the nacho is big but is far from the best i had .
mexican	you could go to taco bell and get the same food . will never go again cuz it 's basura
mexican	average . not impressive at all the corn tortillas were rubbery in the enchiladas . hot salsa had a. weird unpleasant taste to it . rice was ok and the beans were good . i do agree the rellenos are very good .
mexican	disinterested staff . sat at the bar for dinner and bartender seemed annoyed we asked for a food menu . we decided to move to a booth after the bartender disappeared . our new waitress was fine . no menu explanation . luckily we saw the taco tuesday sign on the way in and asked about it . ended up going with at least one of each taco . most of them have mayo based chipotle sauces and are similar to anything you 'd get at del taco . i 'd go back but wouldn 't be excited about it .
mexican	they should be more generous and flexible with the ingredients--especially because there 's nothing special about the ingredients . they use cheese sauce on nachos . can 't tell if the staff is unfriendly because they hate their jobs or because it 's too loud to be heard .
mexican	the restaurant offered me nothing i would go back for . i would say if you didn 't grow up in or spend considerable amounts of time in the southwest / west you might like this place . i put mad mex in the same category as an apple bees .
mexican	wasn 't really blown away by anything . the nachos were pretty lacking . so much for the " never a dry chip , " we had a bunch of them . if you 've been to one american tex-mex eatery , you 've pretty much have been to them all . at least the manager was honest about their mediocre tamales . i give him credit for being truthful about it and not trying to sell me on them .
mexican	i ordered a large burrito , and sure enough it was a good size . however , the burrito was soggy and unappetizing . didn 't taste the lime or the guacamole . i was going to blame it on the delivery service first , but it 's clearly this location . i would love to try an actual fat bastard burrito from another location and maybe i 'll have a few comparisons to make .
mexican	no paper towels makes me wonder if the employees wash their hands .
mexican	girl taking orders was also making food , very slow service and bad attitude . our food took more than 10 minutes after we ordered to be ready and was placed on prep counter to wait while the employee went to make another customer 's tacos rather than give us our competed order . needs better management .
mexican	the ' cheese ' used in the burrito was not a melting cheese , lumpy and unappealing , at best . no flavour from the poor beans whatsoever . service was not an issue , the food however is an entirely different story . bland . the white cheese stuff from bags is just soooo , gmo- ish .
mexican	the beans tasted like the canned beans you buy at the supermarket . overpriced food . try filiberto 's instead . some of them have daily specials running monday thru friday .
mexican	they 're only in business because there aren 't a lot of decent quick options around .
mexican	also ridiculous price for a bean and cheese burrito -- $ 10 bucks -- are you kidding me ? ? and the chips were completely stale .
mexican	gross . very small portion of pintos & cheese . and scanty on the cheese . not up to par .
mexican	the ordering system is stupid . you can only place certain orders at certain windows . the tacos look like tijuana tacos , but they are not worth the wait or headache to even get an order in .
mexican	i should 've manned up and just told my growling belly to quit being a whiny baby and waited until i got home to eat . but , noooooooo . 10 minutes and $ 11 later , i felt gross . i should 've listened to intuition , instead i was stuck on my flight back to san diego regretting every minute . it wasn 't that the food was bad , it was totally edible , just not very good . i would suggest paradise bakery if you must eat and if you decide to be brave-stick to something like a cheese quesadilla . it 's almost impossible to ruin that ... almost .
mexican	tacos underwhelming and service uninspiring . that sums it up folks .
mexican	disappointed that they refuse to do any substitutions ! ! our server walked away abruptly after being unsatisfied with questions about the menu . i wanted scallops , a near $ 40 meal - but with a side salad instead of beans , he refused . i instead went with a $ 20 salad , which he informed me would " only be lettuce . " chips and salsa was amazing . drinks were just ok . food was not exciting . don 't waste your time and money go to a mom and pop mexican spot and spend a fraction of the money ! !
mexican	i know this is in downtown summerlin where rent is high but ... 90 % of meals are over 15.00 ridiculous ! two tables came in reviewed menu and i heard them also talking about the high prices . the lowest thing is a plain burrito at 13.95 . so - they started sending out coupons 2 for 1 for dinners but there 's s catch .. you have to order two drinks . watch it a simple soda is 3.75 each ! lol so u really get 8.50 off of highly expensive meals . really only 50 % off your second meal . lower ur prices your not that great of food and i was around people not coming back again .
mexican	that 's it though . the food us very bland . will not give this place a second chance .
mexican	mediocre food , at best . the water didn 't taste right . the salsa was just okay . i ordered chicken fajitas which were bland and not even worth eating . husband ordered green sauce chicken enchiladas . he said they were alright . nothing to write home about . best mexican we 've had is lopez in cleveland heights or tres potrillos . we could have gotten better food at taco bell ...
mexican	not very attractive , but warm. the waitress was also very nice . asked for quesadillas made extra crispy with condiments on the side- got neither bc it was baked , not crisped in a pan and the condiments were on top . so changed to nachos , but no cheese on them. when i asked the waitress , she said the sauce drizzled over top was cheese sauce. but if it was , it was watered down with sour cream. my aunt got tostadas- meat wasn 't so good , no beans or cheese on them. on one positive note , the green enchiladas tasted good per my uncle. agree with other reviewer- awesome ambiance outside but the food lacks substance .
mexican	you pay for what you see not for what you eat . is like tacobell but upgrated . very expensive and not welcoming at all . how did they survive for 40 years with this type of food and service . our america has lost the good taste for food and they settle for looks . i rather it frozen mexican burritos and save my money .
mexican	frustrating since i drive past it every week wishing we had a great mexican place in the neighborhood . nearby juan jaime 's is better and cheaper with 1 / 10th the attitude .
mexican	too bad the food didn 't match . didn 't think it possible to mess up a taco salad but guess i was wrong . wilted lettuce and tasteless .
mexican	i ordered the taco trio and the fish tacos tasted like dirt , talapia is bad but this really tasted like dirt , even the guacamole didn 't taste the same . i had dinner at the one in summerlin and it was excellent . seems like they have to get on the same page . i heard the one on decatur is really good also , will try that one next time .
mexican	the menu descriptions sound wonderful , but unfortunately nothing is seasoned properly . from the tasteless salsa to the super bland cochinita pibil ... everything tastes like nothing . what a shame .
mexican	great selection of specialty margaritas , but most of them were too sweet . the calamari was good , the taquitos too , but the tortilla soup was not good , and the corn cakes were even worst . the chicken empanadas were marginal . we had a very sweet waitress . very good at her job . overall , will not go back
mexican	the patio at la hacienda was the best thing about this restaurant unfortunately . the service was quick although there were only 4 other groups in the place at the time . the chorizo hash and egg bake was oily and lacked any flavour other than salt while the breakfast burrito was just scrambled eggs and black beans rolled up in a tortilla . a side helping of salsa was provided , which tasted home made . all in all , a mediocre experience .
mexican	if you try to use restaurant .com or groupon .... the restaurant doesn 't count alcohol in the total bill ! ! ! i spent $ 103 and they refused to allow restaurant .com second , .... if you request a song from the band ? ? ? cost you $ 20 bucks ! ! ! even happy birthday.i tipped $ 5 and a band member said all requests are $ 20 . we will not return .
mexican	i will be not returning since every fast food chain in this area doesn 't penalize their customers when they pay with debit .
mexican	hot plates will burn your fingers ! ! ! burnt my finger from the ridiculously hot plate in front of the manager , and he didn 't apologize or offer to mive the plate for me !
mexican	i was using 2 daily deal vouchers , i bought one for me and one for my mom to use . the deal states one per person , not per table , but they would only let us use one . the tacos were delicious , but the experience soured me .
mexican	the last two times they didn 't follow my order and i got a chicken burrito instead of a veggie one . very disappointing . if you order the normal stuff and are flexible about what they actually give you then the staff is pretty nice and it 's not that bad . it was a guilty thing for me anyway so i 'm going to go elsewhere .
mexican	they got our order wrong and forgot a few things . the chicken on my grilled chicken salad was ice cold and showed no signs of it ever even touching a grill ( was home and eating in 10 minutes ) . there was no dressing on the salad and none was in the container or in the bag so i had to eat a dry salad . my wife had ordered a vegetarian friendly salad and it had chicken on it . they reluctantly remembered her dressing . they also forgot our chips and salsa . i hope that they start paying more attention to carry out orders or they are likely to lose some customers .
mexican	the mexican guy that handles the window is an a $ shole . is always rude and i not willing fix his mistakes . avoid this place
mexican	service is horrible . don 't ask for anything on the side because you won 't get it . don 't get avocado because it 's not avocado its guac and its a drop of it for . $ 75 . not friendly and they make mistakes on orders . never coming back- subway is more worth it then this place or making your own at home .
mexican	el toro doesn 't have much for us , and what they do have is standard rice and beans ( meh ) and gluey cheese stuff ( ugh ) . much better choices for us in town are maize ( fish tacos ! ) , huraches moroleon , and wedge .
mexican	chicken was good but isn 't that what a chain food restaurant can do also . fair but i 'll keep driving by as i have been .
mexican	it was already overpriced ! also , who uses nacho cheese at a mexican restaurant ? will not be back !
mexican	dressing optional as it 's so tasty with salsa only . oh ! and don 't forget to squeeze lime on it . flavors are great , serving size is a bit small for the price paid . seems a small salad like this one shouldn 't be close to $ 7.00 , i 'd think more around $ 5.00 . ambience is sort of beachy if you use your imagination .
mexican	totally unappetizing and will not be back . so disappointing as i grew up with popo 's in maryvale and was looking forward to a good meal .
mexican	sad to say this cafe rio will never get my business again .
mexican	unfortunately , this past year food quality and service has dropped exponentially for the exception of one or two servers . whether it 's stale avocado or chips or the a / c is broken it 's sad to see a once great restaurant slowly go down the drain .
mexican	not any more ! they left the price the same and removed the veggie patty . really unhappy about this . looks like nacho daddy is going el cheapo .
mexican	since it had always been relatively clean , i decided to give into my urge for a couple of tacos . nobody was at the counter . i waited , and waited . finally the girl in the kitchen with limited language skills went to find the manager . again i waited and waited . apparently the manager could out wait me because i finally left in disgust . while i was waiting ( and waiting ) a couple of other potential customers came and went . a couple of tacos ain 't worth the wait .
mexican	it 's definitely lost its edge . they nicole and dime you for everything now . salsa is an extra $ 1 , sides are overpriced and the menu items have increased in price . pass next time .
mexican	been awhile since ive been to chipotle and much to my dismay i realize why i make these excursions less and less. seems anyways to be producing skimpier versions of slop. wanted to opt for something vegan and ' healthy ' but im v turned off by the overall sad look of the ' fresh ' ingredients death to capitolism
mexican	steak fajitas not worth $ 15.49 ... served luke warm , over cooked charged for extra tortillas and a few slices of jalapenos ... sever joaquin , ignored us for 15 mins when we arrived and was less than friendly or attentive ... won 't be back ... too bad arribas use to be much much better ...
mexican	inconsistency and especially human laziness is always the root of nothing good ! check your cameras and do some remedial training with the lazy ass excuse of a human responsible for this . a lazy ass will always be the bacteria infection to the success of any business .
mexican	the last two times i 've been here my order was given to someone else and i have to wait for it to be remade . while waiting for my food to be remade this time i watched 3 people wait for their food which was sitting in the heat box . one guy walked up , asked is that my order , they said no , then 2 minutes later they called up and gave him the same food he 'd asked about ! it 's to the point i won 't be back . how many times must i wait for my food because they gave it to someone else ! ?
mexican	sad , but i 'll be searching for a new mexican restaurant .
mexican	lived in utah for a while ... just like you camilla k . i loved the ones in utah and thought i would give this one a chance . the manager guy , don 't know his name , is a total jerk . the food wasn 't even warm . it was cold . my wife and i are sitting here right now and i 'm so upset that i have to leave this review right now . just awful service and not even good food anymore . gradually getting worse . i 'm going to costa vida from now on .
mexican	ordered a taco and cheese enchilada ! took a bite of the taco and it was sour ! ! i had to vomit in the bathroom ! ! the thing that really upsets me is the only thing the manager did was take it off the bill ! ! the whole meal was spoiled ! ! ! will never go there again ! ! she blamed it on the tortilla ! ! ! that was a lie ! ! ! my girlfriend smelled the meat and it smelled rotton ! ! and tasted rotton ! ! long time customer ! ! last time there ! ! ! !
mexican	however , the food and service are erratic at best and the prices on the menu keep increasing significantly . the food is not true sonoran style mexican food - it 's a variation that is lacking flavor . on my last visit , i realize the prices of most items have increased a couple of dollars again . i 'm moving on and giving up . there are far better mexican restaurants in the north east valley .
mexican	restaurant is clean wasn 't overly busy the counter help was quick . i ordered two shredded beef hard tacos side of beans and a fountain drink . wait time wasn 't bad about 20 minutes order was correct . both taco shells were broken in several places , shredded beef was more like ground beef with no flavor . sour cream plopped on the side of one of the tacos . beans in a small container with little bit of cheese warm not hot seems like they are prepared ahead of time . salsa bar was fair . glad i finally gave them a try . probably won 't be back .
mexican	tonight it was terrible and it appears there 's been a big turnover in staff . none of the regulars were there . service was awful , food was cold and soggy and no one seemed to care . so sad ...
mexican	for 15 years on and off i order and they make chicken or beef tacos for me al a carte . so , i order them like usual and the mgr. comes over and says i won 't make them for you , not on the menu . ok ... i say , just put some ground beef in a tortilla and i am good . he says no ! i am so frustrated ! this was my favorite dive bar and now , on principle , i refuse to go back . i asked the manager if i could speak to the owner and he said no ... boy , i wonder how much business this jerk has lost / is losing for this poor owner !
mexican	probably ate here 20-25 times . the last few times things seemed to have been going downhill both food wise and service wise . the last time was , well , the last time . waitress copped an attitude and service was uber-slow even though it wasn 't busy . we noticed a lot of the staff standing around bs 'ing with each other. food used to be pretty good , but no longer the case . we will have to find a new mexican eatery .
mexican	service was so slow and i told the waiter i was dehydrated and was begging for water . there were only two other tables so i shouldn 't have to beg for water . i also had to beg for more salsa and didn 't dare ask for more chips . i ordered the gardein chicken tacos and spit out the first bite and boxed up the rest . not enough flavor for this tex mex chick . probably fun at night when you 're drunk and the place has a really cool atmosphere .
mexican	but after my last visit i wont go any long . aside from the multiple orders messed up . putting fresh , but still with hot oil on them , chips in styrofoam containers . the first time i took my girl friend there she was throwing up a few hours after eating . she hadn 't eaten anything else . i would not advise eating here , the price doesnt match the food quality either .
mexican	on top of that , they have been out of an item i want on numerous occasions . the credit card machines are always broken , the drive through box is broken as we speak , the lady asks me to order then stops me in the middle of my order because she 's not ready . lines take forever on drive through . frustrating experience every time i come . don 't go here , take the extra five minutes and go to the taco bell on happy valley .
mexican	they raised the prices to the point of insanity . it 's basic mexican food ... not fine dinning ! ! ! the prices have gone up close to 35 % ! ! !
mexican	have not been able to get back for several months . went last night , all prices have risen . ordered 3 bean burros , ( $ 4.25 each ! ! ) 2 tacos , a cheese crisp and a beer . total was a massive $ 36 and change ! ! ! ! ! ! way more than before and way over priced . they forgot the cheese crisp. the cheese crisp is now only a store bought tortilla with melted cheese . it tasted blah and was a bit ' chewy ' which is the opposite of crisp . will not be returning .
mexican	mexican food places are a dime a dozen and i refuse to pay for salsa , this was a first time for me getting billed for salsa . lol
mexican	today was no different only to find out that this particular location charges $ 1.29 per taco . kind of disappointed she probably won 't be going back again . in looking online , they 're still advertising these tacos for .99 . not sure if it 's only this location but i 'm not driving around to different locations to find out . bye bye roberto 's . i 'll take me business elsewhere where i know what the price is !
mexican	it continues to go downhill . the food portions are quite a bit smaller than they used to be and the prices have headed the other direction . the flavors aren 't particularly bad , they just aren 't much . rubios is a step above taco bell , but the step is getting smaller all the time .
mexican	albeit mostly the original location in nw phoenix , but i have been to this mesa location 4 times . this restaurant is going downhill . food is getting worse and the portions smaller . further , customer service sucks ! although the prices are reasonable , the food is mediocre at best . you are better off eating at the food courts of the mexican oriented grocery markets - at least the foods there are more authentic and tasty .
mexican	they 've had a new crew the last month and the food has suffered . usually go for taco wednesday and this is the second time the food has been below par . undercooked tacos are no bueno ! not sure i 'll come back and sad about it cause this has been my wednesday tradition , but i like my food cooked thoroughly . i was wondering why they were not so busy , i guess more people are having bad experiences too . this place used to be really busy ...
mexican	too many steps to get what you want , service was slow and inconsistent , and the food was not worth $ 13 a plate . i would save your money and go somewhere else worthwhile in the area . the first entree came out 15 min before the second . the carne asada is something i would compare to canned cat food . the salad looked like it had died and came back with a vengeance . soggy , and gross . wish i had the guts to ask for my money back , but it 's only the second day open so i feel bad .
mexican	mexican food here is not mexican food . they had store bought taco shells and tortillas . ugh what a disappointment .
mexican	been here 3 times and 3 times i had to leave because they were out of something or the service was bad this location also closes earlier than other kfc 's wtf !
mexican	worst del taco staff and management . you need to seriously evaluate your management and staff .
mexican	been here 4-5 times , always have to wait for food in drive thru , they always have me park to wait for the food , the people who work here are always rude , not once has it been a smooth easy drive thru .
mexican	only got in 2 times posted hours mean nothing . they close when business is slow . first meal they forgot to bring the bread with my meal . had to ask for it . it came cold . second time i got there 2 hours befor posted closing time . bone fragment in my meat sauce . could not order anything else because they shut down the registers after i had placed my order . grrrrrrrrrrrrrr
mexican	the decor is nice but thats about it . last time i ordered shrimp it came out so fishy we had to send it back . the guac is good though .
mexican	twice i 've had to talk to the manager about being overcharged . both times the cashiers were budding beurocrats who couldn 't admit to a mistake . both times the manager was good and admitted they needed to communicate better down the line and tried to make things right . i feel for them . they are always hiring so i think turnover really hurts . the bathroom was out of paper towels . the parking is cramped . i tend to come at peak times . on the up side the food here has always been good , the dining area clean and i always run into a friend or two .
mexican	been here about five times since moving to the area , food is okay but too expensive for what you get.lots of better mexican restaurants around phoenix .
mexican	once for a beer . food is quite good ( green chili ) but their customer service is very lack luster , and i 'm not picky . the people up front always smile , but it is always one of those f-u smiles . just a bad vibe . they even charged for a water cup once . not cool .
mexican	today ordered the fish tacos for the first time . not much of meal for 9 bucks . two small ( approx . 6 " round ) tacos with some chopped fried fish mixed in with a lot of cabbage with a small dish of coleslaw . had a tasty chipotle sauce on the tacos though . picked up the first one and attempted to bite in , but before i could it literally fell apart in my hands . had to eat the tacos with a knife and fork . only reason for the two stars is for the service not the meal .
mexican	food here is bland and servers more interested talking to each other than their tables . there are by far better mexican places in the area , like taco bell ! i suggest trying that .
mexican	mediocre food . overpriced . flavorless fish tacos . salsas are not very hot . two stars for good margaritas and service .
mexican	while i love the service , i just feel like everything there is dirty . the menus don 't seem to be washed down and upon going into the restroom this last time , there was gunk on the sink handles and the automatic paper towel dispenser wasn 't working . after leaving the bathroom , it didn 't matter what the food tasted like or how the service was . i just wanted to go home and wash my hands with rubbing alcohol ( which is actually what i did right when i got home ) .
mexican	the server we had acted like we were a bother and he didn 't follow up on the food . when the food came we were missing some simple sauces for my wife 's tacos and we also asked for more napkins . after fifteen minutes i had to get up ad ask the manager if he could get it for is . our server came out with like ten knack ins and dropped a small container of baha sauce in the middle of the table and walked off . what an asshat . won 't be back . i 'll make sure my friends no longer patronize this establishment either . joyride is across the street and they have much better service not to mention food .
mexican	birria de chivo for both my husband and i. the broth was good but the meat was hard and dark and left a funky after taste . not a good sign when your eating goat . too bad , we used to like this place .
mexican	been here a few times for breakfast .... had burrito with " chorizo .... " 95 % egg 5 % " chorizo .... " nuff said will not return .
mexican	stopped in the other day and trash can was full , and tables were dirty . place has gone down hill . food was still good , menu changed and so did the price . used to get 3 tacos for $ 8 . now you 're lucky to get 2 .
mexican	the lady that was doing the drive through window was the least helpful person ever . very demeaning . they don 't have a posted dollar menu / value menu . so i asked wrong apparently , asking about a dollar menu , with a sharp , " we don 't have a dollar menu ! " followed with silence ... " okay .. do you have a value menu at least , " " well we have this this and this . " " okay . well let me get those then . " thank goodness burger king is right up the street . i will be going there for my local burgers from this time on .
mexican	i 've tried both breakfast and lunch and really wasn 't impressed at all with any of it . the place is always packed for lunch and dinner , but i 'm not really sure what the fuss is all about . the chips and salsa are just ok . not very fresh tasting . the sauces on the burritos and enchiladas taste like it 's canned ( or just old ) . i 've had much better for a lot less money . the dishes are spendy and the portion sizes are small . on the good side , the service each time was great !
mexican	don 't order anything for takeout , food tastes terrible once it gets cold . their guacamole is a green paste so i 'd highly suggest not eating it or ask for it on the side . it 's a decent taco spot but there 's better options out there .
mexican	it was not busy at all when i ordered so no reason why my order was burnt . i will give it another try another day and update my review .
mexican	came back today to order for pick - up and everything went smooth . problem is we have been waiting for 30 minutes ( and still waiting ) for 2 burritos . they 're 4-5 workers behind the cashier but no food is coming out . wished our experience here was better . on top of all that , we have groceries that have been in the trunk during this 40 minute wait ..
mexican	didn 't tell me in how long my food was going to be ready in . i specifically asked for roasted chili and onions . i get there to pick up she was rude looked like she didn 't even want to work there . handed me my food forgot two of my drinks until i reminded her and i had to ask for a cup holder bc i ordered 3 drinks . get to work check my order and they forgot to give me the onions and chili and gave me no lime for my tacos ? ! seriously , i 'm beyond disappointed
mexican	didnt recognize anyone . it has been a while . started in drive thru . girl messed up my order . told it to her twice . i could tell she wasnt listening . half way home discovered it wasnt the right burrito . went back and inside . she didnt seem apologetic . i myself had to explain to cook , just a beans rice n cheese burrito . no meat . git home and no cheese ! ! ! i am done here at this place .
mexican	came in today just for menudo . i won 't be back for it again . before i could taste a spoonful i had to skim out quite honestly about 1 / 4 cup of oil / fat first . it literally filled the little styrofoam cup the onions / cilantro come in . they don 't clean the tripe , each piece had a layer of gooey fat on it . spoons were itty bitty , especially if your bowl had the pata .
mexican	just walked in , there 's about 5 customers waiting , no cashier . finally after 5 minutes cashier comes walking from back still on the phone and says " what do u want ? " wow , really ? ? ! ! ! then he was talking and almost forgot to give me my $ 14 change ! ! when he did and me my change the wasn 't even looking at me and instead was turned around joking with the cook while talking in the phone ! ! come on man ! ! someone needs to do some better hiring ! !
mexican	still every time they forget at least 2 things that i ordered . just a reminder to completely check your bag before leaving this taco bell . i 'm not sure how their memory can be that bad but at least it 's consistent ...
mexican	have our margaritas , but they must be picking the avocados for the appetizer guacamole straight from a tree in california ... we had two waitresses ? each of whom told us that the prices on the menu are not correct , but higher and they were getting new menus tomorrow ... we actually ended up leaving ! they didn 't make us pay for our drinks , which was good , but wow ! i wouldn 't be surprised if they still hadn 't put our order in by the time we left .
mexican	first time ever stopped in for happy hour today . ordered the hh tacos . big mistake ! these were simply deep fried frozen tacos with some lettuce and salsa thrown on top . didn 't finish one of the two . grease dripping down my hand . just terrible .
mexican	staff is always seems very friendly . been there three times over the last three weeks and they don 't have crunchy taco shells . that is mine my wife 's favorite doesn 't seem logical with their menu that they would not have those . tonight for the first time they said that they 're deep-frier is broken . staff was still very friendly but quality is seem to drop off over the last few months .
mexican	nice staff , above average food--but tonight , no soap in the men 's room , even after 45 minutes letting staff know ! probably 100 people in the house with a dozen or more severs--and no soap ? people !
mexican	so bad it won 't even melt the cheese !
mexican	the food is spotty . sometimes it 's amazing ( even though it only resembles mexican food ) and sometimes it 's blah . the one constant is the horrible service and slow line . they always seem to mix up the order of the orders in line . the operation is a cluster . i want to go back there and help . just writing about it makes me anxious and mad . sloppy food prep , doesn 't matter what you order because a little bit of everything else will be in your scoop . i 'm done . don 't care how much my kids beg , there are too many better , cleaner , tastier , and much faster options .
mexican	the beans are always dry and flavorless at this location .
mexican	this time , something went bad . pork belly tacos , dry , no glaze and no scallion / onion on either taco . one taco shell hard ( normally is soft ) the other semi hard . brisket tastes ok , but , cold . did not feel like going all the way back down , so , suffered through 2 dry tacos today . update : just ate my lunch . 2 pork belly shells were too hard , could not even bite through them with my teeth . really off the mark for me today . fyi - it also seems when you get the 3-taco ' deal ' you get much less meat than the individual taco .
mexican	the rice was not cooked and made our meals very inedible . it 's sad when your expectations of a restaurant is always stellar and then they disappoint this way . i know everyone has their bad days but because of this , it left anmad taste in our mouth , literally .
mexican	had bad service , small portions and messed up orders multiple times . they forgot to put salsa in my last pickup order . seriously ? how do you forget that ? last time i go here . lesson learned . this chipotle sucks .
mexican	we live in the area so try to frequent the businesses in our ' hood . sandbar is what it is i suppose. cheap drinks during happy hour and ok ( ish ) food . fun place to day drink at times . i dont go to sandbar expecting to be wowed by the product or service , so for what it is , its a decent bar . pro : cheap happy drinks , day drinking cons : food average at best , nothing " special " about the place .
mexican	had coworkers that didn 't want to go anywhere far and chose this establishment for dinner , so i joined even tough i knew wasn 't gonna be good . had the camarones tacos and the quality of the food was so cheap that i couldn 't believe how people can offer that . the grilled shrimp were so small and seemed the ones that you microwave . i wish yelp would let us rate half star because that would be more appropriate as rating . never again !
mexican	on one occasion the lady " forgot " to give me change .. ( seemed intentional ) and i felt awkward asking for it . probably my own fault , but still she definitely knew . their service is so-so . hit and miss .. would reccomend a trip to the newly opened uruguayan shop at kennedy and clarence , brampton . la gran uruguaya.their quality is unreal . and the staff is amazing .
mexican	this last time we decided to sit at the bar to order margaritas and some appetizers . both bartenders were not very friendly , barely said a few words to us . ordered a few tacos and guacamole . please use salt in the guacamole . it was so bland and barely edible .
mexican	this is not the place to eat anymore . ordered one fish taco & 2 beef tacos , drive thru rep was abrupt & very short when ordering . i know it is not a nice place but a hello and how can i help you would be nice . so , lets get to the food , fish tacos , under cooked & not tasty , beef tacos totally skimpy on the beef & full of lettuce . next time i will check yelp for reviews , they have always pointed us in the right direction !
mexican	they always mess up my order , especially at the drive-thru . skip this one and drive 3 minutes north to the mcd 's at alma and queen creek . it 's much better .
mexican	been here three times and every time seems like the staff don 't care if you stand in line for five minutes and no one even says hi .... and you 're the only one here
mexican	the 1st time they struggled to take our orders properly . today , it was moderately busy and it was still taking 20-30 minutes for people to get their orders . everyone started to demand refunds -- what a mess . we won 't go back .
mexican	i used the drive thru not once but twice yet even though i order a tostada salad and other things .. the dressing never seems to make it to the order . other than the food is cold and the quality suck i rather drive farther than try this place again
mexican	one thing i can say as a plus is the bartenders at lunch are always friendly and quick . the food so , not so great . i can never eat it all , the portions are extremely generous , but it 's never very high quality . just kinda seems like it is coming from a slop kitchen , and not really fit for a human . the house margaritas are actually pretty good , and a fair value . i recommend hanging out with a margarita and some chips and salsa ( also pretty good ) and then moving elsewhere for dinner . call me crazy , but restaurants that leave me feeling sluggish and greasy are never my favorites .
mexican	our service was good the first go round , as we sat at the bar and learned a lot from the bartender about their tequilas. the second time , service was no good. very slow and our waters went empty for entire meal , even after we asked for more. they do have great guac and chips and their margaritas are fantastic , and they should be for what you pay. but if you are looking for great tacos , skip this place. you 'll be underwhelmed .
mexican	not this time . meats were flavorless and tough . sangria watered down . very loud hard to talk with friends . prices have gone up and product has gone down . sorry pampas ! not coming back .
mexican	been here twice ... don 't know why i even came back they are over priced and order has been wrong every time .... i can name you a handful of restaurants that have way better tacos for your money ...
mexican	first time was just ok , average taco shop fare . the staff has a hard time with communication in english , but no big deal . well the second and last time , i had to explain 3 times what i wanted. then when it was served , looked and smelled worse . the girl behind the counter was rude . so into the trash the food went and out the door i went .
mexican	last year was a great meal so we decided to go back and it was extremely disappointing . the ceviche and guacamole was great for appetizers however paying $ 28 for enchiladas , 2 or 3 stars was highway robbery . our bill came out to be $ 150 for 2 adults and 2 kids without alcohol drinks .
mexican	both times they were out of carne asada so i didn 't get tacos . tried the ceviche the second time they were out of carne and it practically came in a dixie cup ! literally ... it was probably 4 bites of ceviche for a ridiculous price . i miss the baja fresh that was here before this joke moved in . one star ! !
mexican	the first time my wife got sick and won 't return . the second time my son got sick . the food was very greasy and salty . the chips and salsa are great . i wish the other food was equally as good , but it really isn 't .
mexican	this location specifically is under staffed and it reflects on their dining area which has dirty tables , semi working fountain drink dispensers , and non functioning bathrooms . food wise , i ordered their chicken salad and my friend had the pork and chicken taco meal and a side of chips and salsa . my salad was pretty bland and the chicken was dry . the pork taco was pretty good according to my friend but the salsa was pretty bland and didn 't taste fresh . i think the one on the east side has far better and fresher food and cleaner dining area .
mexican	service is a joke as well , not even a thank you of any kind after leaving a 30 % tip trying to be nice . unless they do some major coupon campaign and learn to flavor their food , i 'm doubtful they will make it to the end of the year . this location needs something good based on it 's close proximity to general dynamics etc .
mexican	best : - salsa is addictive , much spicier than anywhere else around , which i love . -enchilada sauce is great as well . -they are fairly cheap . worst : -the service is soooooo slooooooow . it takes forever for them to take your order or bring your food out . the first time we went we were there over an hour . -the food is not that great in my opinion , serranos is much better & faster . -the decor is awful ! overall i don 't think i would go back .
mexican	only 4 medium sized shrimp and a handful of rice and beans . everybody else 's plate was twice as big and cheaper than mine . nick our server was great but i recommend management that they make this plate bigger since you pay more than the other entrees . i was displeased and left hungry which never happens when i eat at a restaurant . if anything i always have leftovers .
mexican	not one employee has apologized . there there was 1 car ahead of me with a small bag and i 'm still waiting on my food .
mexican	the customer ahead of me are complaining to the people at the pick up windows and they employees are arguing back ! ! ! do not come here !
mexican	what the hell and it smells like weed . i don 't know if it 's from the cars or the employees . i don 't know what is taking so long when ive seen the staff hand people their food 5 minutes ago but no one is moving . this is ridiculous .
mexican	not to mention the fact i froze my nuts off for 60 minutes whilst eating .
mexican	my family is mexican when they came my husband had made his food i was afraid they might not like they wanted more than seconds and they kids love his food . they need to step it up with there flavor and there rice is sticky and there prices are high .
mexican	service is terrible our waiter today sunday december 22 of 2013 , irving took our money and then came back acting innocent asking if we wanted our change back this is low , i can 't believe we got jack at this place ! ! ! ! ! !
mexican	slowest service possible . today , was the only one there , and it took 10 minutes for 2 carne tacos and a corn . and , there was no effort whatsoever to make it speedy . also , service is average at best . fix this and i 'll be here far more often .
mexican	nice patio , fair drinks , overpriced bad bland food . nothing much has changed in 8-9 years of coming .
mexican	food is good the tacos and margaritas especially . i went back recently and the staff seemed to be too preoccupied with each other . the food was still good however i 'm not sure i would go back because the place seemed filthy especially behind the booths , on the light fixtures and bottles above the bar .
mexican	last time we ate there we waited 50 minutes to get our food ( on a slow wednesday night ) plus when i have to pay $ 13 for upgraded tequila in a margarita i expect a strong drink . so close to our home but we won 't be back .
mexican	she wont even look at you when you wave at them . had to go to the inside bar to order drinks instead and me snd my friend got sick drinking the overly sugary daiquiri and long island . had to leave early after feeling sick but did finally wave down a waitress and get some chips .
mexican	service is awful and very slow , portions small , ingredients often inferior , and food overpriced for its quality and portion size . seared tuna was not even chewable , lamb balls dry , potato tapas prepared ma-a-any days before we visited . they used to have tasty ox tail as tapas ; now it disappeared , though remains on the menu , and the waiters lie that " we ran out of it today . " the only reason to go is a huge list of draft beers .
mexican	been there not so much anymore s * * * * * food was great people think they know what they 're doing not so much
mexican	never going back . service has always been bad .
mexican	first time was good but second visit was pretty bad . waited at the door for 5 minutes then decided to seat myself . asked for more dip and chips three times before we got more . asked for no peppers on the fajitas but yes on the onions . sizzling plate came out with nothing but a bunch of dried up burnt chicken . tamales and the wifes salad were good .
mexican	they get one star , only because you can 't give them zero . don 't waste your money , here ... if you want mexican food , just walk around the corner to hussong 's , instead - it 's better food , better margaritas , and a bit cheaper , overall .
mexican	i keep waiting for some reason to love this place but it isn 't there . our last meal consisted of a decent fish burrito , 2 tacos my wife stopped eating and a bag of uncooked tortilla chips . no joke . the bag was 1 / 2 full of raw , uncooked chips . furthermore the salsa , which is pretty decent , had to be filled up by the customer at the salsa bar . there are a ton of quick mexican style restaurants in phoenix and several nearby . good thing dan 's old place is nearby , we will probably just make the drive there from now on .
mexican	unfortunately in every single visit there is something wrong . either bad service , a bad dish , or both . on this last visit , service was very fast at the beginning but once the restaurant got to about 75 % capacity , it totally crumbled . we waited and waited and waited .... too bad cause our server was really nice . my wife 's salad had chicken on it that tasted like gas . adios hot taco ...
mexican	this was not one of them . ate at the bar , no tv , not the greatest selection of draft beer , the chips were like eating cardboard , and the burrito i had didn 't have much flavor . the queso topping was watery and bland .
mexican	haven 't really found one that could be called outstanding . this place is no exception ! ... average food at best , just slightly above taco bell !
mexican	love the food . but this location did not lead up to my expectations . too many workers , could not handle the long lines , and they rushed every customer . the portion amount was very little . the workers seemed upset when you asked them for a little bit more . need to work on customer service .
mexican	service is the worst of any i have ever been to . the past 2 times the carnitas was not even cooked all the way and all fat . service at the counter is pathetic and doesn 't even listen , you have to correct them constantly . when you check out , depending on who rings you up , you get a different price every time ! ! ! do not go here ! ! rip off ! ! ! ! manager even stands by as workers screw up and does nothing ! ! !
mexican	i had the spicy pork tacos and they were just alright . wish the meat had more flavor .
mexican	always a rough to bad experience . tonight was the last time i go here . waited 30 minutes for food . watched them give the drive-thru order to someone in the lobby . they had to remake that order . people sat in their car for something near 20 minutes . when my food came we were missing a burrito and another one was basically made from the wrapper with a tortilla sitting on top of the mess . avoid this location .
mexican	first time i came around 8pm during a weekday and there was nobody at the counter to take orders . waited for about 5mins and decided to leave . there was another person waiting while i was there and i assumed he also left shortly after . decided to come again since there aren 't too many burrito options in markham . this time there was someone there this time to take orders but was thoroughly disappointed in the food . i ordered the fish burrito and seemed the fish was old or microwaved . the burrito didn 't seem fresh at all and did not taste very good . after this experience i will not be coming back .
mexican	went there last night . had a taco de carne asada that did not look , smell , or taste like carne asada . my wife and i were both worried we were gonna get sick . that was the last time we will be going there .
mexican	the food is overpriced and the beans definitely tasted like there canned ! it 's mexican food how hard is to make homemade refried beans ? yuck ! this place is a total disappointment !
mexican	i had to wait a long time before i could place my order because the waitress was hanging around in the back kitchen . the food took a long time to be ready and when i finally get my food , the chicken was dry and tasteless .
mexican	bad service and very very average food .... bummer as it 's in my neighborhood .
mexican	been twice both times was crappy soggy food with microwaved beans and dried out rice and expensive prices ... do youeself a favor and go to central phx or find a roach coach and get the real thing for cheaper instead of this nasty overpriced taco bell food ... and dont get me started on the flan either , yuck
mexican	normally , the staff at this location is great . tonight , however , very different . i went through the drive thru and the woman immediately had an attitude , scoffing when she found it hard to hear my order . i 'm sorry you work for del taco , but this is your job . treat your customers with respect from start to finish for the sake of your company and your pay check . a note to the manager , perhaps make sure the person taking the orders for the drive thru gets some customer service training .
mexican	been waiting 20 minutes in this drive thru when im the only one here and only ordered carne asada fries .
mexican	they care more about carrying out the online order rather than helping people in line . chicken was burnt and rice was soggy . however , when i actually got help they were efficient at getting me out of the line and on my way .
mexican	so my buddies spanish grandma would have had bread , olive oil , olives , cheese and bragged just a little about one of his favorites that was next . man bun doesn 't quite get that . just saying
mexican	after a few weeks of being open they 're already closing early before website says . not good for a brand new business
mexican	these guys are always very slow after 9pm but today was the worst ! ! !
mexican	gave us the wrong order . three times . no apology . terrible service . worst location i 've ever been to . customers in the lobby also have been waiting for a very very long time with messed up orders . would not recommend .
mexican	it was a little busy but got a nice table in the lounge where the band was setting up . ordered some tacos . carne asada and pork were just ok , the shrimp was decent . overpriced beer ( $ 17 pitchers ) but were willing to pay that for the ambience . unfortunately , it was hot as f * * * in there . oh , and when i ordered a bottle of bud light , i got a can ! ! ! going to america 's taco shop next time for amazing carne asada !
mexican	stopped in for lunch . got an arizona burrito . took 10 minutes to make . home made tortilla . small and bland . not worth going there again .
mexican	i 'm a huge mexican fan but this fell short of landing on a top favorite list . chips and salsa were fantastic and our waiter was very courteous and attentive . i ordered the beef tacos-price was extremely high for what you get and there was no flavor to the meat . the corn tortilla was drenched in greasy oil and just a big snooze of what was inside . rice and beans were descent but thats not hard to get right . no plans to go back . the price to park at the epicenter is redonkulous and they do not validate at this restaurant .
mexican	they looked good , had nice crunch , but there was very little flavour other than the citrus which came from the lime . i really wanted it to be better . oh well .
mexican	sometimes you need a cheap mexican food fix and this is the place for it . this place is in mandalay place ..... i 'd suggest spending the extra couple of bucks on food at border grill in mandalay bay for more upscale and flavorful mexican cuisine .
mexican	( heck , we 'll even take taco bell . ) the meat here was cold and the flavor was awful . don 't come here unless you 're a big fan of chef boyardee .
mexican	the staff is normally friendly and usually ( for the most part ) they get my order right . this time , the woman at the window , was not very friendly . i asked her for creamy cilantro , she gave me guacamole instead , she asked if i wanted flour or corn tortilla , i asked for tortilla chips and she didn 't include it in my bag . i didn 't go back to correct my order , because i did not want to get back to work late from my lunch break . let 's just say i expected better service .
mexican	this place is overpriced for the quality of food and the portion sizes . to add to the madness the service is absolutely garbage . it still boggles my mind to this day as to how they 're still in business . i ordered the chicken fajitas and no i wouldn 't recommend this place to even my worst enemy .
mexican	the service and management has been sliding downhill the past 6 months . today we got half the meat we usually do on our bowls . my husband asked about getting a little more and was told he would get charged for double meat . they did not have forks and when i asked the cashier samantha if we could get forks she said " we are out of them . " i asked her if i was supposed to eat a salad with a spoon and she shrugged and looked annoyed . no apology . no customer service . they could use some basic pr training . and a good manager .
mexican	tasty , but when ordering a second ... ran out of agave . boo . ordered a cheese plate and a meat plate . out of the speciality pork . wow , really ? again ? had the grilled octopus , was good , but way too much vinegar . also had the lamb empanadas . i love most flavors , but this was pure indian , with a very minimal bite of lamb . way more fried dough than anything else . on the up side , the staff was friendly and the chef greeted the tables and the flan was delish . won 't be back .
mexican	well ... spoiler alert ! as bad as i wanted to like this place , it didn 't give me that warm fuzzy feeling of home . the food was just okay ( that 's blasphemous to ever say about dominican food ) it 's my favorite kind of food ever and i felt a little sad inside especially my stomach : ' ( .... two stars for effort i guess
mexican	penguins are seeing up igloos inside ! black beans were quite hard and not cooked / soaked . always a high turn over of employees like its a training center . loud in the small dining room with nothing to absorb the excess sound . it 's ok . nothing special here today .
mexican	if those friends happen to be from so cal , don 't bother taking them here . below average food and no even close to authentic . the last and final time i was there , oct 2010 , the table-side guacamole was pathetic . the fruit was not ripe , so the waitress actually had difficulty making it ! i should have sent it back , especially because my daughter wouldn 't touch it and she inhales the stuff at home and at other establishments like agave and lindo . agree with other comments , this place used to be good , but it sucks now . even their management was apathetic to my comments and complaints . done .
mexican	i want the real shizzle . so when i heard that there was an " authentic " taco shop close to work , i instantly knew that i had to try the tacos there . so i pull up and this place is located in a pretty ugly strip mall , but my craving for tacos had me dash for the door . the place is pretty small and clean . so i ordered an " al pastor " burrito and 2 tongue tacos . the food was mediocre at best . the tongue was hard and too rubbery , i was really unimpressed . i personally will never walk back into this joint .
mexican	this just did not measure up . it was not a particularly busy night , but the wait staff had problems keeping up . the food was not good at all . i could not eat the chile releno . it was salty , greasy , and had a fishy taste . enchiladas new mexico style are flat , not rolled .
mexican	this place was neither . we ordered a steak & chicken breast plate which came with arroz , frijoles , pico de gallo y guacamole . the steak was thin , & fatty . the chicken breast was orange in appearance from spice but lacked taste & definition from said spice . the frijoles were mediocre they lacked the true all day simmer with lard that gives the distinct flavor . my husband ordered flour tortillas with our meal & to my shock & amusement the tortillas were not fresh but store bought . the service was great , food came out in a timely manner , & the restaurant is clean for those points i 'm awarding them 2 stars .
mexican	los tacos are by far way better and w / lots of meat and you only need to make one line .
mexican	here , i ordered a steak burrito and a horchata . the burrito was small for the price but the horchata was nice ; i don 't know anywhere else where you could get it . the burrito was bland and not filling . there aren 't many chips given and they too were flavorless . pitt students do get 10 % off with id but sadly i 'd recommend chipotle or qdoba over veracruz .
mexican	i came here with a friend on 31 / 12 / 13 for a quick , last minute dinner as all the other restaurants in town were fully booked . i ordered the chicken burrito and for £ 11 it was actually pretty decent . however i 'm 100 % positive that it was the burrito that gave me food poisoning about 6 or 7 hours later . don 't come to mariachi if you can help it !
mexican	the carne asada was bland and didn 't think this is authentic mexican food but another street faire .
mexican	these tacos i never want again . the chorizo taco had chopped up foil in it . i had to wait 45 minutes in the beef line and my food was cold when he handed it to me . they make the carne asada then chop it up into tiny bits like rice and it was filled with grissle and it doesn 't taste great . i hate everything about this place and food .
mexican	not so much . i spent 14yrs in new mexico and know new mexican food very well . this is a fairly bad knockoff of what new mexican food is . si senor is a bland chain in new mexico that is reaching to capture other markets apparently . this is no los cuates !
mexican	this place was horrible . i ordered the chicken fajitas and they looked like a piece of rubber , or if it was warmed up in the microwave and tasted the way it looks . this is not new mexican food ! i also don 't like the cheesy names on the menu like the roswell burrito or the carlsbad enchiladas , really ?
mexican	first their salsa was essentially canned rotell , chunky and flavorless . the queso was made from the giant cans of cheese you can find at walmart . i had chicken tacos and the meat was so dry it took me awhile to chew each bite . rice and beans were bland and tasted worst than canned . the waiter told us this place was closing . i feel bad cause he was very nice and a good waiter but based on the quality of food and skills of the kitchen staff , i understand why they are closing avoid this place at all costs
mexican	most of their meals do not so that is very disappointing and thus i do not go out of my way to go back to the restaurant .
mexican	can 't really say i 've missed anything : the bag probably had more flavor than the cold , limp fries and unmelted cheese on the all-lettuce " chicken " tacos .
mexican	havana cafe doesn 't even come close . i can make better food at home . their pasteles were bland , as was their rice and their beans . the mojito was pretty good , but not worth being disappointed over the food . wouldn 't go back .
mexican	the food is awful , tastes nothing like mexican food . so tasteless , definitely different from my first visit but that was on the eastside of vegas so that might be why .
mexican	well , i have had better mexican in atlanta . the service was just ok and the munched raved about chimichanga arrived soggy on the bottom , sitting a retried beans and loosing its crispness .
mexican	serving rotten fruit as a side dish to a breakfast burrito is embarrassing . food was rancid , it actually makes me angry . this place got our $ 40 for breakfast , don 't let them get yours . close this place down , what a pit .
mexican	this place is anything but that . ordered cochinita pibil and i can say the cans they sell in latin stores taste better.service was a challenge , may be because it was a busy evening , but still , i believe they need to prepare for those nights , no ? also , not friendly staff.they don 't talk or establish any rapport with customers . i have been there two times because it 's one block from my place.won 't come back anymore though ...
mexican	we ordered the jaela , a seafood platter and the lomo saltado , a steak and rice dish . the lomo saltado had an overwhelming taste of wine which is in all my life of eating peruvian food , i have never had lomo saltado cooked in wine . highly uncharacteristc . the jaela had pieces of octopus that were uncooked . in fact , half of the pieces of seafood i got in the platter were uncooked or chewy in texture but not in a good way . not saying that the restaurant was awful , but if someone is expecting true authentic peruvian food , this is not the place i would go too .
mexican	service was very slow for a saturday night at 8pm . the introductory corn muffins were tasty but i would have preferred chips and salsa considering how slow the service was . we had a pitcher of the house margaritas which were heavy on the sweet and sour and seemed light on the alcohol . i had the spicy shrimp nachos and my g / f had the mexi cobb salad . the shrimp were the tiny shrimp which lacked any real taste . her salad seemed fine , both portions were good sized . overall , not great value , fair food but nothing special .
mexican	but the customer service is beyond horrendous . i thought i was getting fast-food , not a dine-in service . it took them 30 minutes to even order my food , and i wasnt even gonna order much to begin with . i love their food , but they need to fix their time management .
mexican	this place is terrible . the entire experience is not enjoyable . from the bad attitude of tina at the hostess station and the slow service of jose . it 's all terrible . food sucks . just go to taco bell and save yourself the headache . same food quality and a whole lot quicker .
mexican	this place will screw your order up . having read the reviews before going in the drive thru i paid extra attention to my order and had to correct the lady three times before she got my order right , her broken english did not help either . when i received my order i double checked a few items that i wanted plain , but could not check everything since they piled my order in one bag and i did not want to hold up the line . sure enough when i got to my destination i found to be missing five dollars worth of my order . how bad do you have to be to mess up mc donalds ?
mexican	over priced food . tried a few different options . would guess that the main ingredient in most dishes is sugar . everything had unbalanced sweetness . the street taco was not a " street taco . "
mexican	ingredients seem lower quality than qdoba and chipotle , extras cost more than both restaurants . wouldn 't recommend .
mexican	some of the staff needs an attitude check . usually i don 't have big a problem , but coming on a wednesday afternoon , the guy with dreads and gold chain was terrible . horrible , horrible attitude . good god .. at least show some common decency for your customers . also for some reason , flavors of the food are never the same on different days .
mexican	chips were stale , portions where small , staff was nice though . ordered a burrito and the girl used a ripped tortilla . when she first saw it she started to get a new one but couldn 't pull it out right away so she gave up and used the ripped one . slightly disappointed . i 'm not expecting fine dining , but would at least like it to be comparable to other visits .
mexican	was served cold tamales . they reheated it and served it again . should have made a whole new order . rice was hard & crispy . seemed left over from previous day .
mexican	we came at happy hour and we 're not given any menu or any rundown by the staff that happy hour was even occurring . extremely overpriced . 13 dollars for flavorless melted cheese- queso fundito . not fun and about 10 cents worth of meat in a 13 dollar meal . absolutely won 't be back .
mexican	would not come back . employees were nice , though . i paid eight bucks for a chicken sandwich consisting of lettuce , tomato , white sauce , and bread . what a rip off , especially since it didn 't taste good . apparently they charged lower prices in new york but now they expanded and raised their prices . take your food chain money to chipotle where you at least get onions in your burrito .
mexican	the beer came in a plastic cup . the only thing worthwhile was sitting outside overlooking the strip .
mexican	and $ 6 for chips and guacamole ? unless you go to chandler high , skip this place .
mexican	we got a veggie bowl and chips / salsa .
mexican	food tasted rushed and bland . lacked traditional mexican culture in the food . honestly felt like i could make there food myself . even down the the coffee i ordered tasted real cheap . first time here . maybe ordered the wrong food on menu . but dont see myself going here again especially with it out of the way location .
mexican	salsa is non traditional . chips were seasoned which was weird . drinks were week , and service at the bar was terrible . go somewhere else . seriously , not worth your time .
mexican	we went once and everyone in our party agreed that the food just didn 't hit the spot . when the check came , the prices were a little higher than we anticipated and we felt we had wasted our money , especially with some good restaurants within walking distance for a comparable or cheaper price . brgr and mad mex come to mind . to be honest , i would have rather gone to chipotle around the corner .
mexican	bland guac , the rice and beans tasted like leftovers / stale . weak , super sugary margaritas ( and not cheap at that ) . would not go back .
mexican	each one was about $ 1.79 . you might think that 's a good price until you try them . the carne asada was bland , dry and the quality of the meat was poor . the al pastor was better , but also dry . my expectations for the pork were high when i say the meat on a spit , but it doesn 't come close to al pastor at other places around town .
mexican	both entrees were shrimp and both were terribly overcooked . food was fast so the shrimp were definitely reheated and terrible .
mexican	unfortunately since then their service has slowed to a snail 's pace , the food isn 't the same quality , and they raised prices . too bad . great burritos and bowls , good service and reasonable prices . our favorite gilbert fast mexican place : )
mexican	all the food was bland and service was just as disappointing . we sat for several minutes without even getting our drink order in . the chile releno was a disappointment . the breading was just totally mushy and disgusting . i had high hopes but i think i 'll stick to el jalapenos down the street !
mexican	rice was not cooked all the way . food was lukewarm . salsas were flavorless ( maybe not fresh ? ) pretty disappointing .
mexican	ben here several times i really love spicy food of any ethnicity use ghost chili sauce at home however i could not eat the farmers burrito it was so spicy the waitress removed from the bill and offered a replacement but the wife was already done probably won 't go back and that 's a shame because the ambiance is better than most mexican restaurants
mexican	be prepared for a bad stomach the next day everything is basically microwaved or heated in the oven hygiene can be an issue
mexican	he insulted my sister . completely unprofessional and uncalled for . a horrible employee and person .
mexican	in addition to paying an arm and a leg for a breakfast burrito , i also had to deal with one of rudest staff members that works there ! i would have kept paying their outrageous prices ( i am a fan of supporting local businesses ) , but after being so rudely mistreated by their main staff member , i have not and will not visit again ! i would also discourage others from going there , until mangos rethinks their prices .. and hires new and friendlier ( english-speaking ) staff !
mexican	the food is good but my vegetarian companion found beef in the burrito . we won 't be returning .
mexican	waited more tban 30 for burrito . go to burrito company down the street and in and out in 5 min and they have better food at burrito company .
mexican	we waited 10 minutes for the waitress to get our drink order , 10 more minutes for it to arrive , 10 more minutes for chips and salsa and 20 more minutes for 9 tacos . cheese was burnt , forgot my side of rice . only checked on us twice ..... needs major improvements for me and my friends to come back .
mexican	the food was poor . ordered tortilla soup and guacamole . soup took 30 min and guacamole 40 . thought i was ordering quick derive items . soup was luke warm and not very good . guacamole was flavorless . no additional chops offered or given . manager came by and all he could say was i am sorry . put you time and money somewhere else . then it took a bit to get a check and no other apologies
mexican	two stars mostly because the lady 's attitude sucked & having to repeat what i wanted so many times made me cut my order short just to avoid the hassle of ordering additional items ( or trying to ) with this overwhelmingly joyful employee .
mexican	small portions and over priced . i 'd rather spend my money at chipotle .
mexican	we waited well over 30 minutes for a seat ( 2 people ) and i counted at least 20 open seats at tables they apparently were not seating . we arrived just after happy hour ended and the margs while tasty were way to small for the price they were charging . the table side guac was well done and made to your tasting but the tacos were thrown together poorly and were just mediocre . my wife and i love mexican and are pretty easy to please but unless i have a meeting or reason to be in solon we will not be making a special trip back .
mexican	fajitas used to be better . it 's almost like they are pre making them and keeping them warm . not the crowds that used to frequent this restaurant because of above reason .
mexican	so food was good but nothing i would pay $ 90 for . yes $ 90 for four people . it is so over price and not a great selection of the tacos de canasta . won 't be back .
mexican	too bad none of the atmosphere moved to the new mad mexican . food sill great , but more suitable to old location south of annette
mexican	the menu and quality is otherwise just typical fast food chicken
mexican	i 'll make this short ... my family will not be returning .
mexican	food is definitely tex-mex and needed some seasoning . regular guac is seriously lacking -- we didn 't do the table side . beans were lacking in flavor . we went on a sunday night and definitely got sunday night service -- very slow ! !
mexican	good stuff . we ordered two before the yankees v indians game . otherwise , the food was bland , and the portions small , for this so called mexi-cali fusion restaurant
mexican	do not get the stuffed peppers appetizer ... tasted horrible , very small and too expensive !
mexican	bland run of the mill mexican food . you can get the same thing at filebertos for a lot less . ordered the beef fajitas . no seasoning , very bland flat grilled meat . my fault for assuming " grilled " meant flame not flat . condiments include an abundance of sizzling onions with some bell pepper mixed in and a few slices of avocado ( no guac ) , beans and rice and 3 tortillas . the hotter salsa was actually pretty good . good flavor , nice heat . maybe there is better selections to try off their menu but the fajitas were terrible.service was sparse and slow . just a dissappointing experience all around .
mexican	come here for chips & dips & drinkies or go elsewhere . the enchiladas and tacos are ho-hum . with so many other excellent mexican food choices in town , this place can be skipped .
mexican	this is so upsetting all of the above were rude , unprofessional and especially the manager , threatening to call the police when they were in the wrong , after all that they waived the extra charges because assuming to call the police was not putting a scare into us when they were in the wrong ! ! '
mexican	ordered the same shots twice and was charged very differently with one being excessively high .
mexican	unfortunately it 's not the quality it was 15 yrs ago . food was drowned in sauce , and bathrooms were truly authentic mexico ( and not in a good way ; dirty & rundown ) . service was just average . pricing was very expensive for what u get .
mexican	no flavor . and chicken doesn 't look cooked . worst mexican i 've ever had . lol . how 's t hard to mess up ? but yea never ever .
mexican	the big disappointment were the watered-down mixed drinks ( i went through a 23oz mojito and a captain and diet coke ... a total that would have floored me if it 'd had anywhere near the amount of alcohol it should have , and the drinks are not cheap either . the atmosphere is cute and looks over market square , but i was too miffed about the rip-off to enjoy it .
mexican	the fajitas were ok but it didn 't come with sour cream which is a must for me . it did come with guacamole which you would usually have to pay for at other places . there wasn 't much seasoning on the steak and veggies . my husband dish was satisfactory , i don 't remember what he even ordered so that says a lot . service seemed disorganized , it was a full house and they just recently opened so i " ll give them a break because of that . wouldn 't go back for dine-in but maybe for their take out area for a quick burrito or taco fix since its the closest mexican place around the area .
mexican	better than currito burrito in the cleveland airport , but still not as good as chipotle .
mexican	to be fair , i 'll note that i prefer new mexican style . i ordered a combo that came with refried beans , rice ( good ) , 1 chicken taco and 1 shredded beef taco . very bland . also ordered a cheese quesadilla with green and red salsa . the red salsa tasted flat and was missing something ..... it just tasted like red chilis and water . the green salsa is what saved the day . super yummy . i 'd go back for the green salsa . next time i 'll try a burrito . i 've heard that they have good breakfast burritos too . i only gave two stars because the salsa was the highlight of my meal .
mexican	unfortunately , it 's a little pricey for mexican food and really not all that great . if i really have a craving for good authentic mexican food i usually find myself driving into tow to carolinas at peoria and 91st ave .
mexican	had beef burrito enchilada style . ( i know , not my usual attempt at healthy eating . ) i am reminded why i don 't eat this way anymore . bland and not a good feeling afterwards . it was a moment of weakness . one and done .
mexican	those that think this joint is authentic probably also think sizzler is a great steak joint . decent decor , very average food .
mexican	or at least don 't show up at night . my whole night got ruined because i came here . right now i 'm pissed because of the stupid ass ghetto people around this area . they ruin the fucking mood when you walk into a mexican taco place . they just come in and bother everyone and scream and shout . shit man ... if i ever come back i am getting it to go . fuck this place and fuck all the other tacos mexico i am going somewhere else . oh yeah for the record the carne asada was kinda burnt . the lengua was good . the rick was dry but the frijoles were real good .
mexican	be careful of cash transactions at this place . be careful of giving small change . i got ripped off by $ 0.05 . my total was $ 10.78 and i gave the cashier $ 10.85 in cash . he was suppose to give me back $ 0.05 , but did not . $ 0.05 is nothing to me . do once , they can do it twice . maybe in a larger value . cashier didn 't put my cash value in the receipt . cashier input my cash value as exact amount as requested on receipt .
mexican	i had the chicken and baja tacos only . not that different from anywhere else . casual dining like chiptole . salsa bar is good . the ghost salsa is really spicy . the guacamole was good . i may try a bowl another time but it is too far to make a special trek
mexican	customer service was nonexistent and the staff were very rude . what a waste of $ 70 + .
mexican	this has been by far the worst " mexican " restaurant . i don 't understand what triggered their mind to go into the restauranteur business ! ? ! machaca is supposed to be a dry beef with egg but this was oozing of water because it was broiled . good thing i don 't live around here , i had found this on yelp from a dr. visit .
mexican	the location is near the ghetto a bit and is a busy location .
mexican	this is such an immense contribution to the plastic pollution problem . in an establishment that does not offer beers " to go , " there is no excuse not to use glass .
mexican	food was so-so , i did like the fried flour tortilla chips . but the red chile burritos are beef and not pork . they don 't serve rice , the pasta like side with carrots and peas is marginal at best . but its the bait and switch happy hour menu you have to be careful of . they offer a $ 3 house margarita , but will charge you $ 7 saying you ordered a " big " margarita . save your money and go to carlos o 'briens , macayos or top shelf .
mexican	used to go here all the time especially since it 's open 24hrs . went there a few months ago about 1am and ordered a pretty big order for a group of friends totally was about $ 35 i paid with card and when i got the receipt back he charged me $ 80 ! ! ! when i told him to refund my money back he pretended he didn 't understand me and only spoke spanish ! then he gave me another receipt showing the correct amount . i was charged both the $ 80 and the $ 35 ! they steal your money ! !
mexican	also they jack up their prices and can 't get the order right prices went from about 7 to 8 bucks a plate to 12 to 15 ridiculous . i will never return to pay sit down restaurant prices for pathetic lackluster mexican food , gross . the one on main and sycamore is way better and they have the 5 buck chimichanga plate .
mexican	had dinner round 5 : 00 at the bar had a couple sips of my margarita and felt odd and so did my boyfriend . got food to go and passed out on the way home and don 't remember anything , and my boyfriend woke up with an awful headache.pretty sure the bartender put something in our drinks . just fyi . the food i 've heard is good but won 't ever go back there .
mexican	husband and i went here for lunch and that night we were both incredibly sick . this was the only thing we had eaten that day and we both got sick with the exact same symptoms which leads me to believe we got sick from this location .
mexican	i ate here one night and was in the hospital the next day with salmonella poisoning !
mexican	we had 2 each ( they were on the smaller size ) and within 45 minutes , we were running to the porta-potties ! ! then , we had to rush home . we had to stop along the way , as well ! this establishment ruined our entire day , as this situation continued throughout the night and the following day . i don 't want to assume what happened , but i would never take a chance again with this place ! walk ( better yet , run ) from this food booth ! !
mexican	my husband and i both had a few bites of the steak from there and it didnt taste right so we stopped eating it . ( that is the only thing we both ate the same that day ) . we both ended up with horrifying food poisoning for 2 days . i am pregnant so of course i am extremely scared and mad . still have yet to get the little one checked out ... but hopefully the baby is okay . please avoid this place ! i feel like i died for 2 days and am finally coming back to life .
mexican	second time coming and once again very disappointed . ive been waiting more than an hour for a quesadilla ! ! ! everyone in my party and other people that walked in after us have been served with their food except for me and my uncle . i talked to the waitress and all she says is " its on its way " seriously never coming back .
mexican	ordered : whole tilapia carne asada plate ( food poisoning ) machaca shrimp cevice ( this didnt get me sick ) i had been there many , many times with my family . i was willing to tolerate poor service in exchange for cheap and decent food . but then one day ... i ordered the carne asada plate and everything on my plate was hot ... except for my meat ! ! oh they warmed it up for me ... but , the real question is why did i eat it after that ? i got food poisoning . never will return
mexican	oh , and their parking lot cameras are coincidently " not recording . " never going back to this place again . completely violated .
mexican	pretty sure the fat lady manager ( hispanic ) at this del taco location is a apart of a group of people stealing people 's atm cards . she is either tipping someone off or stealing them herself . there are several reasons why i believe this to be the case . i hope lvpd sees this review and arrests these pieces of shit .
mexican	i ordered a breakfast burrito with no meat and no sour cream for take out . i asked for extra salsa . i go to pick up my burrito and it was just an average size burrito with no extra salsa on the side . i had to ask for the salsa and when i went to pay i was charged over $ 10.00 . yes ........ $ 10.00 . i asked for a manager who did refund me my money but no discount off the burrito . i left . beware ! chaotic and unorganized for sure !
mexican	the very unfriendly worker asked me if i wanted it with everything and i of course said yes not knowing that it was three dollars more for sour cream and cheese on my tacos . the staff is very rude there and horrible to deal with . the pastor is very good and does not need to be drenched in sour cream so i would like to try it again on its own , but the carne a is horrible , just flap meat grilled and chopped with no seasoning , not even salt . not good , not good !
mexican	she also went from handling cash to serving food without washing her hands ! and of course my order was wrong since she wasn 't paying attention . sorry pollo , you are off my lunch list !
mexican	the tamale dinner gives you a choice of red beef , green chicken , green corn and blue corn tamales and says it comes with rice and beans and green or red chile . i ordered the red beef tamale and when i inquired about the green chili i was told since i ordered a red beef tamale that i got red chili . what ? there was no chili on my plate . and the waitress was rude in addressing my polite inquiry . i gave two stars for the awesome spiciness of the food ! ! !
mexican	worst service ever . the few times i 've had amnesia about how bad it was and have come back i 'm reminded ten-fold just how terrible this location is . the last time we waited 25 minutes in the drive through . when we got to the cashier they were clueless - no apology , no nothing . the workers inside looked like they were moving in super slow motion and our food was incorrect as usual but the thought of going inside and trying to resolve my order was worse than the initial experience itself .
mexican	complete tourist trap . ive lived in the area for 5 years now and have only been here once . once was more than enough - the shawarma is not authentic as they use poor quality ingredients and not enough at that ! not fresh and completely underwhelming . the owners don 't care - they just want to make a quick buck off of tourists . had had issues with food authorities in the past over cleanliness . stay away !
mexican	luckily we caught it and had them remake the food .
mexican	pretty sure i got food poisoning from this place . wasn 't thinking right when i walked in and saw how dirty the place is - should 've ran .
mexican	they finally have prices on the interior food menu but not on the drink menu . so i ordered a margarita thinking , how much could it really be ? ! ... well , it 's $ 16.88 to be exact . rebecca the bartender was great but the prices were not my taste .
mexican	they literally pick at their food , the ladies use their finger nails as forks and the go back to work without washing their hands . i witnessed this personally today . in a county where restaurants are constantly being shut down due to poor employee hygiene i 'd expect better .
mexican	what should have been a 10 minute wait turned into 45 because of deliberate slow service . there is a single person cutting meat , who insists on putting everything back into a warmer after serving each customer . if only they utilized their staff properly , and had multiple people preparing food ( instead of standing around and managing the line ) the owner obviously thinks that forcing people to wait will make their barbecue taste better . and based on these reviews , most people fall for it .
mexican	this location charged me extra as a tip without my knowledge . the price i was owed is different than the price i was charged and they also did not include my drink with my combo like they should . this is a late night scam ! beware
mexican	went in there just for two tortas ahogadas and ended paying $ 30.00 i will never come here again ! ! ! i will glady take my business elsewhere .
mexican	was eating here last nite me and wife and found a four inch long pice of hair in my food it was so disgusting i really did like coming here but will never come back ! ! ! even worst was manager first didn 't even come over to apologize had to ask to speak with her she acted like it was not a big deal she offer to take off that order she should have taken care of my whole bill really bad management disgusting food prep seriously how dose that happen no reason at all to ever happen do not eat here
mexican	it 's amazing how tasteless food could be dished out here , maybe its better when you 're inebriated . doubt it ! however , the guacamole and ribs were ok .
mexican	the meat had little to no seasoning ! this place seems to be striving for average at best
mexican	the worst mcdonalds in existence . they make the food bad . not just mcdonalds ' bad ... worse . every time i get into the drive through i ask , " why do i punish myself ? ( because i like the sausage burrito ) " it is almost so bad i want to write mcds , and tell them . but it 's mcdonalds .
mexican	most menu items not available . took the narrowed down food suggestions and promptly became ill . nice people behind the counter though but the family is here all sick .
mexican	bad flavors , uninspired menu , taco not worthy of taco bell . spoiled cheese . a waitress who lacked even the most basic knowledge and who has never tasted a single menu item . brought my 3 item combo minus the third item . i had to catch her attention only for her to say " oh yeah i thought something was missing when i picked it up in the kitchen . i 'll get it for you now . " these guys won 't last long . don 't go by the phony yelp reviews .
mexican	a surly staff member posted a cheeky response to my complaint on facebook . the management promised publicly to send me dinner on the house along with a profuse apology . great pr , but when i called them on it , the offered me two burritos and told me to pick them up . they claim to offer take-out , but they never answer the phone and don 't return messages . i was never rude to them even once but have been treated with a complete lack of respect . unacceptable and completely unnecessary .
mexican	beans were microwaved before serving too . place is not to clean either tables are sticky .
mexican	i ordered a carne asada burrito and a grilled chicken burrito . i really don 't know what meat i consumed that they called carne asada . it was terrible . chicken burrito i could take it or leave it .
mexican	this is the first taco bell i 've been to where you had to wait for over 13 minutes to get your food . the sad thing is that they weren 't busy . if you go , bring a fidget spinner to keep you entertained .
mexican	the double chicken avocado salad was my choice , but after arriving home , almost half of the chicken was ineligible to be eaten . it was either rubbery or fatty and chewy . the other half of the chicken was good , but some soggy lettuce doomed most of the salad , even though the dressing was served on the side . at about 7 bucks , this wasn 't a great deal or meal . watch your chicken people . update : customer service and manager responded to my online complaints in a timely fashion . they were both nice and gave me coupon codes for free food .
mexican	ordered a margarita and the glass it came in could almost pass for a shot glass . $ 10.00 later .... a shame for so little .
mexican	the meat was cooked extra burnt , overpowering the other flavours of the whole bowl . cashier was extremely rude . the staffs were tasting the fresh chips with their hand , yet did not wash their hand after , just continue packing the chips . not impressed at all , the location at don mills is much better , with better quality food and service
mexican	no alcohol and ( at keast some ) soda was served from bottles . wife liked the ketchupy red salsa ; i enjoyed the green . chips were chewy and greasy , not bad , but different . i had the chiles rellenos -- the green sauce was bland and the chile , very mild . my wife has the chicken enchiladas with the same bland sauce . kid one had a red tamale that had mushrooms , etc. in it ? wasn 't expecting that ! kid two had scrambled eggs . this place just isn 't worth it . there 's way better mexican in town and spinato 's is right across the street .
mexican	only good worker was the manager and for that i give it 1 star .
mexican	it goes downhill from there . no flavor in any of the toppings ( shredded chicken , green sauce ) . and the lettuce was placed in the container dripping wet , which means my burrito was soggy from sitting in water .
mexican	nothing special about menu and prices leaned towards expensive for a location targeted to locals . service was worse than average as we often felt like an afterthought . need to try their unlimited taco and margarita night before i draw my final conclusions .
mexican	fryers are shared with flour and corn and so is everything else . they are obviously trying to jump on the gf bandwagon without regard to who gets sick . oh well , back to chipotle !
mexican	wow ... disappointing , crazy expensive dry tacos and dustbowl rice . server was slow and not happy to be there . we all had tacos , chicken tinga and steak . portions were small and well done . definitely won 't return .
mexican	i had to grab our server to get another beer. she was very inattentive and or overworked with too many tables. my lady had the chille rellano which was decent , but not great , even though i love skirt steak . i had the shrimp fajitas which were also just okay , although there was a good amount of shrimp. even after piling some of our plates at the edge of the table , it took another 10 minutes to get a dessert menu. next time we will go to ri ra with their awesome local discount .
mexican	i was very unimpressed with the food though . that made paying for it even more difficult : you cant get out of there for less than 15-20 bucks . they had a guy playing clapton tunes one night , which was cool enough to break even on the experience haha .
mexican	my husbands chicken was burnt , my carne asada was tough . although the margaritas were tasty , they were $ 10 a piece , which none of the prices for margaritas were printed on the menu . spending over $ 60 , we expected higher quality food .
mexican	mad at the world cause you broke . didn 't even let them take my order because the customer service was so bad . trash .
mexican	the food was lacking , the service was lacking . i had the " signature " diego carne asada , and there was no notable marinadey flavor that i associate with even the weakest carne.the chips were crumbs and the salsas forgettable . even the drinks were meh at best , and how can you mess up alcohol ? a $ 90 meal for two people , and seriously i would have eaten better at one of the strip 's seventeen la salsas ! you hurt me .
mexican	completely forgot to give me my cinnamon twists . and gave me tons of hot sauce all of which were not the one i asked for . paid for extra black beans , instead got extra disappointed ...
mexican	spoiled rotten guacamole . when informed of the challenges they could care less . i guess if you have a captured audience it doesn 't matter and the people here don 't care .
mexican	couldn 't eat it . fyi that means it 's bad ! - extra for sour cream and guac ? fine ... but don 't advertise on the menu that it comes with both on the menu ! - finally kid behind counter sighing and rolling his eyes who wasn 't focused on work . he either needs a break or needs to be educated on open kitchen behavior . my previous chef would have fired me for acting the way he did . unimpressed , mostly because of the rotting ( not bruised ) cilantro . never going back .
mexican	who does that ? and the hot sauce tastes like bbq sauce . seating is very uncomfortable . you sink down in the chairs . this is our third time here as we usually give a place 2-3 chances . doubt we 'll be back .
mexican	eating inside i feel like i 'm on the streets of mexico because of the cheap plastic chairs and dirty environment . i don 't see what the hype is about this place . the ordering system is quirky and irritating . the food is an odd mix and i don 't care for it .
mexican	beans were good . taco very greasy . enchilada quite greasy . don 't even want to think about the fat content of my meal . yes i know mexican food for the most part is fatty but this was excessively so . service ok . food came out quickly . i 've certainly had better mexican food especially considering we drove almost an hour to get there . loved the decor ! good lunch specials . parking lot really crowded .
mexican	i expected a lot of flavor but the food was very bland . ceviche was good as a starter . my short ribs were under seasoned and lukewarm . my wife 's shrimp dish was okay but lackluster and was also served nearly room temperature . our server was friendly and the manager greeted us but people were seated inches away from us though the restaurant was nearly empty . $ 16 sangria was essentially white wine with a few bits of fruit thrown in for looks .
mexican	lots of food . lots of really bland food . salsa was flavorless . mashed beans masquerading as refried bean dip . and the soup tastes like a wet dog smells . howard johnson style decor . chipotle is better , and that is saying a lot . second the opinions on the the weird tag teaming service .
mexican	margaritas served in a small martini style glass , soooooooo full of ice that it is about 3 sips and it 's gone . nachos served in the chip container with a " splash of cheese " on top and pico de gallo the rest was dry as sh * t. the chips were wet from the pico de gallo they put all over the top . yuck ! the only thing that is normal is the beer . save your money .
mexican	hot sauce was either hot and no flavor or no heat and no flavor . guac tasted very " watered down " i think they just increased the sour cream to make the dip last longer . staff wasn 't very friendly . the place doesn 't look clean , but 2 stars because we didn 't get sick .
mexican	no salsas served with the tacos . drinks are strong and actually good of you like tequila but expensive . i much prefer authentic mexican like la catrina in brampton .
mexican	not great . i 've had worse but also had much better . i had a burrito which was ok and a chicken quesadilla that was horrible . ( didn 't think you could mess up a quesadilla ! ) my husband enjoyed his meal !
mexican	was fresh but not much flavor . chicken burritos same reaction blah fresh but lacking flavor .
mexican	please don 't go here . lackluster menu . watered down cocktails . tasteless food . overbearing waiter . the hostess and valet were lovely . that 's the only nice thing i can say about our experience . so many better options in clt for chips and guacamole and margaritas . we ordered drinks and guacamole and tapas . not one thing i would order again . saw a bunch of kids when we arrived at 6 : 30 , so maybe that 's their target audience . kids with low standards .
mexican	the pork nachos were ok , but the cheese was not very good and there was minimal pork on the marginal , kinda stale tortilla chips . the rice , beans , and lettuce were , again , standard restaurant cheap stuff from a restaurant supply . gross ... my chicken ' burritos ' were bland with minimal chicken and nasty cheese . service was slow , as stated by others . never again !
mexican	its way overrated and super expensive ! nothing really tastes fresh or authentic . your better off taking the time and making it at home.soggy fries , frozen corn , dry cornbread and meat that is so overcooked and smoked i cant taste what animal it strarted off as . final verdict .... boo !
mexican	tacos and empanadas are not up to par . i would not even compare it to the filbertos on every corner of phoenix . very americanized tacos , which lacks flavor and spice .
mexican	the salsa was the only thing on the table with any true flavor noted . we honestly have not been here before but my son was excited to try it as the place seems to be busy on first fridays . as noted in other reviews , the service is ok - but they seemed eager for us to finish and leave - which wasn 't relaxing . well , now we know and we honestly will not be back - too many other places with great food .
mexican	blah .. that 's all i got ... been here twice and will not be back .... not sure when it became kosher to serve bland mexican food and cover it in cheese .... perhaps because they are catering to the over 65 crowd in fh ? ? ? go to senor taco ... the food is authentic , the people are friendly , and you will walk out with alot more money still in your pocket .
mexican	the pico is good flavor . the portions are big but the food is lackluster . filibertos blows this place out of the water
mexican	went for taco tuesday and got a small tortilla with a bit of chicken on it . as i headed to the salsa bar , i saw a giant cockroach climbing the wall . i 'm out .
mexican	what a disappointment ! after reading reviews i was anxious to try this place , but it was a total let down . we all ordered recommendations from the waiter- stuffed peppers , green chile meatloaf and tacos . no one was impressed . i 'd go here for drinks . the restaurant was really cool inside and the margs were great . pass on the food though for sure !
mexican	and i thank you for the three-day colonic that resulted from eating here . despite the restaurant touting its vegetarian / gluten free options ( even here on yelp ) , rudimentary items , such as the " cheese crisp with guacamole " are , in fact , lard-based . i understand lard is used in authentic mexican cuisine , which this is not . here 's a " concept " for you , fox - label your menus in accordance with 21st century standards . as a result of this visit and your irresponsible practices , i 'm removing all fox restaurants from my dining and entertainment repertoires - too many other superior ( and responsible ) options in town .
mexican	plain and simple . the food sucks ; it 's not even mexican food . the only thing mexican is the fact that they use words you 'd find on a menu at a mexican restaurant . i love other fox restaurants so i was quite surprised . try again guys ... better yet , don 't !
mexican	even with salsa on the tacos it tasted like nothing . the rice has a ton of butter and the beans are half cooked .
mexican	phoenix has a lot of great mexican food restaurants , this is not one of them .
mexican	ordered the large chicken burrito and regretted it almost immediately . they were out of black beans ... i would think this is pretty basic for a mexican spot ? no spices or really any flavour to speak of . pass .
mexican	whats with the fries ? ! no body in the world wants mexican food with fries . a bad representation of phoenix in an impressionable location . besides the sub average flavor the tradion of bad attitudes and slowness from the employees carries on from the 16th st location to the airport . never again barrio . dont believe the hype .
mexican	if you 're looking for anything remotely close to tex-mex , this is not the place ; try your luck at emiliano 's ( south side ) or gran agave ( bloomfield / waterfront ) . if you 're looking for drinks , just go to buffalo blues next door .
mexican	bland and over cooked ( burnt ) asada. wouldnt go eat there again .
mexican	weak margaritas . good service , but overall disappointing experience food wise .
mexican	good service however . everything is extra , chips and salsa , sauce etc .
mexican	this is what i would expect mexican food to taste like in canada . also , with your meal you get a tiny helping of chips , seriously there may be 10 whole chips in the basket . if your in a pinch i would go across the street to taco bell !
mexican	in fact , the best thing i could say about it was how neatly the cook packed and folded my chicken burrito .
mexican	sadly this is why we will be walking past mazama in the future .
mexican	this is my first time writing a review on any website or app and its because i was so blown away by how terrible the food was . i 've also noticed that every other valley location associated with this one is just as bad . everything between the salsa , food , and horchata tastes bland . the good news is that there are plenty of other great filibertos in the valley
mexican	i had to smother my carnitas in hot sauce to make them edible . do not recommend this place at all !
mexican	the food here is just plain bland . it requires hot sauce just to be palatable . beyond that , prices are fine and service is pretty good .
mexican	i came here with the hopes of it being great . the location is cool ... but i ( and girlfriend ) ordered two burritos ... they came with salsa ( not much flavor ) and chips ... the burritos themselves were poor , and the service ( person at counter seemed annoyed ) the pork was dry , and no offering of hot sauce , etc ... only thing that was decent was margarita . but that itself seemed like the pre mix you could by at any store ( and cost eight bucks ) let down .
mexican	i was thoroughly unimpressed . although the portions were huge , there was absolutely no flavor to the food- just bland chicken and cheese inside an overly fried shell . i will not be returning
mexican	service was good but food and drinks ( mojito ) were bland ! ! ! we went to have a date night at casa don juan and sadly my husband and i were disappointed , coming from san diego and spoiled by amazingly authentic mexican food ; nothing here had any flavor . from the salsa for the chips ( it had heat ) beans were bland and if you order a tamale , that is exactly what you get a steamed tamale with nothing and hardly any meat . my husband had the chimichanga platter and it was bland boiled chicken fried in a tortilla . the mojito taste like lime juice over ice ... very disappointing
mexican	very disappointing . the rice and potatoes are very bland and the chicken is basic , the hot sauce is also basic and not very hot .
mexican	we ordered beef rolled tacos . they barely had any meat . my 6 year old said they were too plain . we also had a cheese quesadilla which was dry . the carnitas burrito had potential but it was soo bland . the shredded beef chimichanga was good .
mexican	bland salsa . bland food . food came quickly , waitress did not return to the table until we were done . i had to get up and find someone to refill my glass . my wife 's chicken nachos had no onions , peppers , or cilantro . the meat in my burrito and enchilada had a grainy texture . the taste was not horrible , just bland . i have no reason to return .
mexican	warning sign # 1 : all white people dining there . warning sign # 2 : salsa that 's bland as ketchup warning sign # 3 : no hot sauces on the table the three of us each had a different item from the lunch specials . yet our plates looked almost indistinguishable from one another . on each was some configuration of flour tortillas , mountains of shredded iceberg lettuce , and a slick of pale refried beans , all topped with orange cheese . you can get more flavorful " mexican " food at del taco . this place is more like mexican 't food . ulgh . i want my $ 5.25 back .
mexican	go to tacos el asador for good portions , flavours that are more mexican and prices that match what you paid for . mexitaco is a rip off joint .
mexican	needs some salt . yes the hot sauce is spicy but taste shouldn 't be just about " how hot " the salsa is . i 'll try it another day and update my review .
mexican	and the chips were way over seasoned . queso with the chips was the most edible thing but i wouldn 't order it again .
mexican	if you want good burritos , go to burrito boyz next door - better tasting and cheaper . the service here was good though .
mexican	way overpriced . taco bell is better and at least has hot sauce . get this , jalapeños cost extra $ $ at senor peppers , what a joke . how is this place open ? because the locals have never had mexican food and think it 's something special , it 's not . go anywhere but here , it 's genuinely the worst meal i 've ever paid for and if still bothers me a year later .
mexican	phoenix has plenty of good mexican food ... i don 't know why anyone would waste their money here . even their hot sauce was flavorless . taco bell is a better bet for late night . want good mexican ? try tortas los reyes , carolina 's , or most wanted ... not this place .
mexican	nothing was terrible but nothing to write home about either . i posted a new photo of the menu because the one i looked at on yelp was out of date .
mexican	absolutely nothing special about this place , and we 've been a few times just to be sure we gave it a fair shake . sad , because we were really looking forward to it opening .
mexican	we did not feel welcomed coming in . dirty walls and decorations . no mild red salsa .
mexican	they got my order wrong and took fifteen minutes to fix it a half empty dining room . my wife ordered sour cream and guacamole with her tacos . the tacos showed up . the sour cream and guac did not . our server was nowhere to be found . another server did bring them over but we got a glib reply for the manager . the bisteak and chicken tacos were bland and dry . the chorizo was very salty but otherwise not flavorful and also quite dry . finally , the server took my wife 's plate while she was still eating . skip this place !
mexican	skip this place , you will be disappointed . the food isn 't that good and they were so rude .
mexican	$ 4 for an a taco . you will get a better taco at del taco for 1 / 3rd the price .
mexican	bland food , chips wer really thin nd tasted stale nd the burrito i ordered tasted like it just come out of a microwave .. im surprised it has 4.5 stars .. not to mention its up fr a rennovation .. go somewhere else fr a 9 dollar burrito .. definately not coming back ..
mexican	got the # 7 platter which is a fish taco and a mini burrito . the fish taco had no flavor and the mini burrito was sub par . the iced tea is from a machine and tasted awful ! i poured it out and got the instant lemonade instead .
mexican	an upstate new yorker recommended this place ; i don 't think they have eaten a lot of mexican food . i would take seniors here who do not care if their food tastes good . it was not bad food , just bland food .
mexican	had they put as much time and moeny in to the recipes and service instead of the property it woudl have been much better . nice location but there are much better alternatives ! ! yo qiero tace bell after this one ! !
mexican	staff was nice . atmosphere was great . won 't again though because the food wasn 't good .
mexican	small portion sizes . bland chips . no salt on tables . had to pay for salsa . i do not recommend this restaurant . do not come here ! ! !
mexican	our server was the best part of the meal - by far . want good mexican ? go to juan 's flaming fajitas on tropicana , off the strip a few miles , well with the trip ...... see my review of juan 's for more info .
mexican	the service was horrendous . the waitress hit me from behind with a tray , she didn 't come to the table for 15 minutes before taking our order , she didn 't bring plates for the nachos or any forks and knives , no sweetener for the tea , and it goes on . the quickest thing i got was the check and that was after i walked to find the waitress to ask for it . don 't waste your time with this place .
mexican	service was very slow . the crowd was dead ( late sunday ) but music decent . bill was $ 60 for 2 people and we ended up only eating a few bites .
mexican	had the flautas , got 3 greasy rolled tacos with a sprinkle of cheese , i had to pay extra for the guacamole and sour cream . absolutely tasteless . boyfriend ordered the tamale plate .. tamales were dry and over microwaved . will not be coming here again that 's for sure . next time i 'll have taco bell for " authentic " mexican .
mexican	no lime though . flat soda , request for replacement never came . tiny margaritas . not worth it . almost empty restaurant with slow service . disappointed in our first vegas dining experience .
mexican	have eaten at mad mex at least a dozen times with a friend who loves the place . tried everything from tacos to enchiladas and burritos . it all tastes the same and in some cases looks the same . another corporate restaurant offering big food that 's better marketed than prepared .
mexican	no flavor in anything . don 't waste the walk from your car inside . i 've had better mexican at taco bell . the best part of the meal was my diet soda . after our plates were cleared it took over 20 mins for the waiter to bring our check . not recommend at all !
mexican	with not even a liquor license to help wash it down , there 's really not much here besides steam table meats and soggy pico . chips are extra , no salsas to try and flavour anything , tamales dry and soggy at once ( how ? ) much too common in this city unfortunately . kensington market remains hugely overrated ( not to discount a few gems ) but avoid this place . you 're better off with old el paso . not to mention my friend ordered a coffee and asked for it twice and it never came .
mexican	i was so bummed out my party of 5 all left there plates almost full great tap water horrible food " my advice stay away bland tasteless food yuck super sad "
mexican	they had us waiting nearly 15 minutes before they asked us for drinks and gave us chips. we were 3 minutes from just walking out. to top it off , they wouldn 't honor my 100 % valid bogo-entree coupon. it was an entertainment coupon which means the restaurant signed up voluntarily to be a part of the program .. which is irritating that they wouldn 't accept my coupon without a reason. our server asked my boyfriend if he 'd like another beer , but did not refill my obviously empty water cup. don 't go here - mexican food isn 't hard to come by in phoenix .
mexican	i ordered the chicken and beef tamales and a mango margarita . never receieved the margarita and the tamales didn 't taste as good as the looked . oh , and did i memntion that once out food was delivered , the waiter never returned ?
mexican	that is the single term i would use to describe this meal . even the " spicy " table side guac was bland . the chile colorado wasn 't that great . a few pieces of the meat were really fatty , and they do the version which is cooked to order and not the version in which the meat simmers in the chile sauce for hours . to make it worse , they must have had some " bring your screaming young child " promotion or something . for that i blame the parents for not giving enough of a shit about teaching their kids about proper public / restaurant etiquette .
mexican	totilla was kinda burnt though why would a burrito go back on the stove to be closed if it 's wrapped correctly ? it made the veggies soggy . if i go again i won 't get veggies in my burrito . good point : the staff was nice , place is clean and its got lots of drink options .
mexican	had to wait a while to be seated , not because the place was full , but because they were understaffed . menu is small , the food was boring , and very salty . i guess there is a market for this , but it was a very forgettable experience . also , even though we were there for under 30 minutes , we had to endure the same loop of music twice ... yeah , the mexican hat dance . maybe this is considered as passable mexican food and ambiance in iowa or something like that , i expect more from my city than this flavorless spot .
mexican	do yourself a favor and drive a little farther up the road and hit up los taquitos .
mexican	i had 2 fish and 1 bean taco . the beans were good - the rest of the tacos , not so much ! they were kind of slopped together . no fountain drinks - cans and bottles only . so much for being eco-friendly hippies .
mexican	i wish i went to subway . oooohhh , their receipt was printed on their paper , too . i think dog food is better .
mexican	vomit served in a variety of ways at dos reales . i can 't believe anyone likes this place . if you like this place , you either a ) don 't know the meaning of flavorful mexican food or b ) have no taste buds and can 't wait to have nasty diarrhea in a few hours .
mexican	the owner should be embarrassed by whatever employee chose to act so unprofessional .
mexican	the salsa tastes like they opened a can of stewed tomatoes and threw in a pinch of parsley . the food was greasy ( not fried ) and left my stomach unhappy . my plate looked like they just slopped the food on it . the hostess was friendly and attentive unfortunately the waitress was one of the worst i have encountered . if you want good americanized mexican food , go to on the border .
mexican	there 's a reason they give the food away here half price half the time and have a million coupons and deals on line . the food sucks . service was unprofessional and harried despite the place being nearly empty . the room has all the ambience of a bus station . crummy live band was playing way too loud . stay away . stay far away .
mexican	disgusting ! just went for a quick appetizer and to feed the kids and it was horrible . kids food was fresh out of the freezer / microwave and i can make a better quesadilla at home . and i can 't cook .
mexican	had the fish tacos , they tasted of fish that had been bottom feeders that had been frozen , thawed , refrozen and then thawed again before cooking. i.e. mushy and not the best . they were cheap though ....
mexican	hated this place . the waiter was creepy , the food was boring and i felt a little sick after i left . i 've had way better meals at taco bell ..... there was nothing even close to authentic about this place .
mexican	hubs and i did not care for this place at all . i would rate filiberto 's higher , and that 's sayin a lot . we 'll stick to ramiro 's , even though it 's farther .
mexican	the flautas were really extremely small taquitos , the chicken flavorless , the beans canned , and extremely small portions for a hefty price . i 'm sure there are better options in phx airport .
mexican	the saltiest mexican style food i 've ever had - worse than places like baja fresh . i had the fajita burrito with chicken . if you like salty , give it a try ; i won 't be repeating it .
mexican	we ate here over a year ago when we first moved here ... never to return . it tasted like " mexican " food you get in kansas . low quality and not very authentic . sorry ... didn 't care for it at all .
mexican	complete and utter disappointment . i 'd sooner go to taco bell and del taco before i would ever set foot in filiberto 's , rigoberto 's , aliberto 's or any of the ' bertos in that chain . yuckity yuck yuck yuck yuck . did i say yuck ? best mexican by far i 've found here has to be rosa 's .
mexican	chips that taste funky , like the oil is rancid . salsa , macayo 's used to have awesome salsa , but now it seems water-downed . this place looks like it needs a power-washer and a deep clean . and the food was meh and really not very good .
mexican	my pork arepa was drenched in oil . that usually wouldn 't turn me off , but the arepa was completely flavorless . i had to drown it in " spicy " salsa that was more mild than vanilla pudding . never again .
mexican	do not go here for food ! you have been warned . my coconut almond crusted fish sandwich had no flavors just bland with a crunch ! ; ) my boyfriend ordered a burrito and was given something that almost looked like a burrito minus those little brown spots tortillas get from being cooked . so what wrapped around the stuff ? god only knows ... service sucked too , it took the girl so long to put in our order and then so long to get our check and it wasnt even packed . : (
mexican	if you 're like me and searching for new mexican style green chili outside of colorado and new mexico don 't come here . staff is really friendly and the place is pretty cool but the food tastes nothing like new mexico style . the green chili smothered is actually just shredded green chili there 's no pork or stew so sorry none of that . bummed .
mexican	i had a chile relleno & cheese enchilada combo and i was disappointed from first bite to last . the enchilada sauce was extremely salty , the enchilada tortilla was tough to cut as was the ortega chile used for the chile relleno , which was also filled with seeds . the beans were thick & pasty . i want my money back .
mexican	service was incredibly slow , the food was pretty decent , but it took so long to get my bill that any joy felt for my meal was long gone before i left the door . the only reason i darkened the door of on the border was a sorority function , the staff had advanced notice that there would be ~ 20 people in our party and they seemed ill prepared / short staffed to handle us .
mexican	" so ... that being said .. i 'm not sure why everyone 's giving it 4 / 5 stars. sure they have a super cute truck with a hot gal painted on it , but really ... looks should only go so far !
mexican	i 'm a regular starbucks fan , and this was my first visit to this location . i ordered my usual latte and didn 't think to taste it until after i had left , and it was aweful ! i was in a rush and couldn 't go back so wasted the $ 5 . something tasted off with a strong hint of chemical ( cleaner ? )
mexican	i was not expecting to have real authentic mexican food , but this was just bad . the food had no seasoning or taste whatsoever and was missing a lot of key ingredients . also the service was terrible ! took a long time to take our orders , we had our empty plates in front of us for about half an hour and we had to ask ourselves for the cheque . i will not be returning ! !
mexican	that 's really all to say about someburros . the only reason i came to this place was because of an unused gift card that i had for over a year . i ordered a common mexican food item : a carne asada burrito . the steak was bland , the salsa was okay . i think the only good thing about this place was the chips . save your time and money and take your business elsewhere . this is a very mediocre mexican food restaurant that i am not even sure how it stays in business .
mexican	the food is worse than a chain like rubies- the bathrooms and tables are dirty and sticky- we got a highchair for our lo and it was filthy ! ugh
mexican	i order my burrito then try to order a water cup and got cut off about 3 times . it was 8 : 30 so i guess she really wanted to get home to watch game of thrones . then she proceeded to ask me 3 additional times if my name was really morgan . i 'm a guy by the way so i 'm guessing this was blowing her mind harder than my water cup order . foods delicious , i just think they could walk left or right for a couple minutes and find a more competent cashier . i 'll stick to los favoritos and tacos n more from now on .
mexican	have messed up every single order i have ever placed through this particular location . expect a very long wait for your delivery order , or they may botch it entirely and rekey it as a pickup . every time i have gone inside to pick up an order , staff are angry at one another , rolling eyes , and the atmosphere is chaotic and occasionally abusive . 1 / 5 stars , turdfest .
mexican	blue burrito grille - mexican redefined ... my question is ... redefined to what ? dont think good mexican needed to be redifined in the first place ... when they say your burrito comes wtih sour cream and guac ... its like a thin thin layer spread by a butter knife .... failed ...
mexican	poor quality of meat on the ribeye .. your dress coast says business casual but a hobo could walk off the street and get a table . and they pack them in like an in and out burger at lunch rush . very cramped and loud atmosphere . : (
mexican	i especially love the chandelier ! the tapas however are mediocre .... the lobster bisque was the consistency of paste . don 't do it . the ceviche , which was the winner of the evening , while not traditional , was quite good . the mussels were overdone , but ok . the service was not what you would expect - unbelievably we were served a basket of half eaten bread and they were out of several items on the menu we wanted to order ...
mexican	? overpriced for what it is . hard to order , awkward , also dry blood sausage
mexican	i 'ved contacted him repeatedly asking for my deposit back still hasn 't refunded me . its been about a month now . very disappointed and unhappy with taco heads experience i would not recommend them to anyone .
mexican	boo ! i had a blast hanging out with you back in the day - when i was kickin ' it back at case western during undergrad . now , i fear - that love affair is over . long ago are the days where we would study in your dining room , enjoying " bottomless " chips and cheese from your lovely staff . fast forward to today , where you are not attentive , and rarely get any orders correct ! i wrote no sour cream . why is my bowl covered in white goo ? ... again ! it is possible to get back on track - i believe in you !
mexican	tried it twice . bad ingredients . boo . open sundays though if you like bad tacos on the weekend .
mexican	when did green tomatillo salsa turn red ? at this place . the drive thru girl actually tried to tell me that offred = green . never again will i stop here
mexican	made reservations and expected spectacular . sorely disappointed . service was slow and disinterested . food rather dull . poblano enchiladas were not hot and i probably should have returned . very little peppers . much better " real mexican " offerings in texas at half the price , i was looking for authentic southwestern cuisine and had planned on another restaurant until persuaded to try border grill . i should have stuck to my guns . i 'm no a snob with my texmex or authentic mexican . i eat many owned small restauranats in texas often more than once a week . i am a fair reviewer and really do enjoy most offerings .
mexican	bland . over cooked meat . if this is authentic mexican food , you are shaming mexico . great that they are open late , and the prices are good . prepare for the meal with no less than 72 napkins to mop up the grease from the meat ... which you would think would be a sign of meat that had been cooked right , and would be moist , but it 's not . it is rubbery over cooked poor quality meats , slathered in seasonings and marinades and served right out of the greasy mess they were cooked in for far too long . avoid this place unless it 's your only option . oh , and they don 't take credit cards .
mexican	the salsa and chips were the highlight . enchilada tasted like nothing , enchilada sauce would have been better if it came out of a can , chili rellanos were ok , maybe less than ok . prices were high for the quality and quantity . do yourself a favor and visit juan 's instead . quite a crowd here for a friday night , and why ? el rey in globe has much better mexican food , the rest of the globe-miami area isn 't exactly a mecca of mexican food so the review of best of globe-miami isn 't a ringing endorsement .
mexican	beans tasted like they are from a can . nice atmosphere . would rather go somewhere with better mexican food .
mexican	i 've come here quite a few times and have been disappointed each time . first of all , what mexican restaurant thinks it 's ok to charge for chips and salsa ? second of all , who puts 7 chips around a bowl full of salad and calls that a taco salad ? small portions , not much to choose from , slow service . but , the guacamole and lime margaritas are both really good . i 'll give them that . i could continue with my review but you get the idea . hopefully .
mexican	ordered 2 different tacos all tasted of the same seasoning . it reminded me of 1980 's non culinary boring tacos ! very disappointed
mexican	that 's the best word i have for my lunch today ! i ordered spicy shrimp fajitas and not only did my plate come with only 8 tiny shrimp , they had no flavor at all . i kept wondering why there was no one else in the place on a saturday at noon and now i know why - i will never come back here .
mexican	the waitress bored us with her lack of interest . this is my 3rd visit and the thrill has gone . next time i will save the money and hit the drive up at taco bell . i am sorry i bothered to ask for more tea . i know you we 're busy texting or smoking or discussing what you did last night . i won 't bother you again .
mexican	i was really craving mexican food so tried the fired up taco truck . the shrimp taco was sadly disappointing ! overbreaded popcorn shrimp , cole slaw ( this does not belong in a taco ever ! ) , cold corn , cold tortilla , and too much sauce . i loooove mexican food , and sadly , my cravings were let down . if you 're looking for authentic , keep your expectations realistic here .
mexican	they tasted like powdered margarita mix was used if that 's even possible . the chicken chimis i had were very bland , gross & didn 't come with any kind of garnish or cheese . this was my first and last visit .
mexican	$ 14 for a glorified taco ? come on now . ingredients seemed fresh but the ' glorified taco ' seemed tasteless unless you load it up with their special sauce . waitress was super friendly and earned her tip . apparently many like the place but it wasn 't for me .
mexican	interestingly enough , saturday night , we both had bean and cheese burritos with guacamole here . i 'm not saying we got food poisoning from filiberto 's , but it is definitely suspect .
mexican	what we got was poorly flavored food and disappointment . all 8 members of my party thought their meals were sub-par . however , the bartenders were outstanding ! go for the margaritas as miguel makes his without mix the way they should be and with fresh lime juice !
mexican	find another mexican restaurant on the strip to go to .
mexican	forgotton guacamole , wrong tortillas , and last night there was an eyelash in my fajitas . not to mention the fact that the delivery driver was incredibly rude ! never going back , and for shame because i really love mexican food and would eat it daily .
mexican	had the chicken enchiladas and pork tamales . enchilada in green sauce were nothing special . spanish rice and refried beans where mediocre . pork tamales with plenty of meat where over seasoned and abit salty . one of the servers was attentive . on second visit had a famous margarita . the large glass with plenty of ice was way two sweet and again nothing special . not a fan .
mexican	we have been here twice , trying various dishes and have yet to find anything exciting . the salsa is served in old fashion carafes , and just doesn 't have any kick . i expect more from a neighborhood taco shop . lastly , the service is slow and not nearly friendly enough . i would go so far as to say that the server was annoyed that they were busy , an odd attitude for a restaurant !
mexican	nothing special , nor is it authentic mexican . large menu of basic version of enchilladas , fajitas , burritos , etc-- clear indication of a lack of imagination of the chef / kitchen crew . the salsa is watery , tacos and fajitas are very bland . the cheese is obviously processed low quality product . clearly , very very poor concept of a restaurant from bbg . the physical restaurant in north hills is very poorly lit , it 's dark even at the middle of the day . the decor looks like a psychedelic throw back of the 60s / 70s , horrible colors .
mexican	tasted like a terrible salad . the rice and chicken literally have no taste . nothing at all like chipotle . nice try making it look like it and even the names are similar , its just terrible food . definitely do not eat here .
mexican	$ 25 with taxes . came in at 9 : 15 pm . there were 6 orders in front of my order . it was a busy night ! when the guy packed my potato salad into a plastic container , he touched a protruding potato with his bare hands ! ! ! ! ! unprofessional , indeed ! the potato salad was extra savoury nonetheless ; ) the chicken was just ok . costco 's roasted chicken at $ 7.99 tastes better ! best to order when they are not so busy that they forget to put hand gloves : (
mexican	it was ok , the price is right thats for sure . $ 1.06 for two tacos. its kinda like taco bell but the meat seems a little more suspicious.i wouldn 't come back here unless i was broke and hungry or very intoxicated. taco bell is a better choice
mexican	food is not authentic meat had no type of seasoning . corn was plain no flavor what so ever , place is clean prices are like 2.95 per taco drinks $ 3 corn $ 4 . would not come here again taco bell steak tacos are way better and cheaper !
mexican	they didn 't last very long at all . it 's the curse of that shopping center i assume and the fact that you are pulling into a shares parking lot with little caesar 's pizza and wal mart . oh well on to the next new place
mexican	very dirty , the meat was horrible there were bugs and roaches in the corners on the floor like they have been sweeped in a pile .. do not be fooled buy the tasty groupon pic . would never go back here
mexican	this location is closed down . called the frank lloyd wright location and asked whether they would honor the coupon . was told to call back when the manager arrives @ 5pm and ask him . hopefully they 'll honor it . have to wait and see .
mexican	the beans and rice were fine but the meat seemed to be of a low quality . i will not go back and wouldn 't recommend .
mexican	the food was just ok . we ordered a bean and cheese burrito lunch plate , and a shredded beef burrito lunch plate . it took a long time for the food to come out , and when it did , the inside was lukewarm . it was not hot at all . our waitress seemed new , or just knew very little about the place . it 's a shame the food wasn 't better as our office is very close and this would have been a convenient lunch place .
mexican	they said they no longer have a contract with groupon and would not honor it . then when i checked in to yelp there was a coupon for a free drink once again they lady said they wouldnt honor it . finally the lady gave me 10 % off and a free drink . i was happy at that point until the food arrived . the chicken in my salad was delish but quality of the lettuce and the lack of other ingredients made it undesirable . they barely give you anything and they over charge you . your pretty much paying $ 8 bucks for lettuce .
mexican	he hands me my tickets and i walk out the door realizing i never got my change . walk back in and there is a line of 15 people . i walk to the side and tell the kid he forgot my change and he says he gave it to me and then returns to helping his customer . shouldn 't expect much intelligence from a gas station employee , but 20-15 isn 't hard fucking math .
mexican	called the manager and he said i had a wrong location and then said no one ordered around the time i did . so i said would be happy to bring my receipt and bag of cartilage . busted . proof in hand and he could care less . so all customers with a complaint are liars until they the managment was busted lying ? will never return , forever ruined arizona burritos for me : ( amigo dogs on glendale is my go to mexican food place now . super awesome customer services and not once have i gotten a bad dish .
mexican	don 't know how many times previously fried but had to trash ! very disappointing because child rellano is excellent and a real treat !
mexican	wife got a taco . i am now throwing up pizza now since 7 pm . food poisoning . stay away
mexican	i ordered a chonga to drink , appetizer to share and shrimp tacos . the bill ended up being over $ 100 for the 2 of us ! ! ! ! what a rip off ! i ended up getting food poisoning from the shrimp btw . won 't be returning
mexican	my mom almost broke her teeth and she was sharing it with my 2 year old daughter . i called to speak with owner or manager and no one spoke english . they couldn 't even understand what i was trying to communicate . they said they would give my number to a manager and i have yet to hear anything . saving the salad and rock and contacted the food and drug administration . absolutely ridiculous .
mexican	nice and loaded but after they wrapped it up . they didn 't heat it up like other burrito joints . my burrito was very cold and ended up being very messy and sloppy compared to other burritos i 've had . i will not be returning ever again
mexican	bought some tonight - ( 2 ) 12 piece ( 4 / 21 ) and they were " all " way over-fried ! breading was the darkest that i have ever had when ordering fried zucchini . given the amount of times that i have ordered this item and the amount of times that they have screwed it up . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . i 'm done with this place . . . sucks to be you ! should have just got some from carl 's jr . . . . . they would have been way better- !
mexican	it must be coming out of her check if she gave me extra sauces. seriously 3 packets smaller than ketchup packets
mexican	i entered my code and it said it was already used ! wtf ? stop trying to recycle codes ! what a rip off !
mexican	now i know this could be lays fault but i brought them back to the store and they would not exchange . the chips are cheap and it is the principle . i will be gassing my 92 ' grand prix and hitting the road from this sunway gas stop from now on . buyer beware . 1 star !
mexican	ordered 3 types of meat and they were all served cold . flavors were not that great .
mexican	it sucked ! container was empty they only gave me 8 shrimps for 20 bucks ! ! fucking rip off . never again . service was horrible as well .
mexican	no seasoning whatsoever . even the cheese dip i bought on the side was funky tasting . welcome to no 's .
mexican	the skin tasted good , flavorful but the meat is blant also you can still see red-ish / bloody parts which im not comfortable eating . will i go back ? no . will i crave for it ? no .
mexican	bought two $ 16 slushie drinks , no alcohol in them go to fat tuesday 's instead
mexican	where sunset 's guad features a relaxingly lit , thematically decorated restaurant area , this one is a glaringly bright , cramped quarters affair with a cafeteria feel about it . there 's a self-help salsa bar that gets extremely messy and unsanitary looking , with significantly fewer options than the other location 's extensive array . the restaurant can get very noisy and kid-tastic also . food quality isn 't up to par with what we are used to from the guadalajara name either . i 'll be sticking to the sunset location .
mexican	white rice , pinto beans . " what 's your meat ? ! ? ! " " um could i have some veggies ? " ( worker gives small scoop of veggies ) " what 's your meat ? ! ? ! " more veggies please ... " ( gives a little more veggies ) " what 's your meat ? ! ? ! " { giggle jeesh } " steak " { okay ? } weirdest meal at chipotle ever ! meat nazi does not accept ingredient requests out of order ! ! also the restaurant was messy , tables were dirty , it was cold and horribly uncomfortable . meat was cold btw .
mexican	you can get chips and salsa for $ 6 . the food is meh , the back patio is relaxing next to the flamingo hotel water flow . generally besides a cure for a hangover , i wouldn 't be found at this place anymore .
mexican	food was tepid . chips were stale . had them replaced with the same product and poor attitude . no beer for sale and no one available to make a margarita . did not see any evidence of any management either . too bad . cut the loss and move on . not sure what the attraction is . certainly not the food and most obviously , not the service .
mexican	apparently the hotel and restaurant were sold and you can tell the new owners really couldn 't care about quality and service anymore . what used to be a hopping , full-of-fun and life restaurant is merely a shell of its former self . food - if one could call it that - was awful . stale , dry meat as part of the tacos and burritos . rice and beans were like straight out of the can . all in all , it was pretty much disgusting . service ? well , our waitress did try . i think she was happy that we were drowning our hunger in booze .
mexican	it 's now the carls jr of mexican food . not quite the mcdonalds as that would be of course reserved for taco bell . pretty much all their salsas are boring and bland . hot salsa tastes like marinara sauce . high school cashier employee forgot our chips and drinks . then told me to wait while she proceeded to greet and help another customer . had to get the bus boy to get them for us . carls jr actually has better street tacos than this . though not by much , they are about equal . rubio 's puts guacamole on theirs by default . who puts guacamole on a taco ? fish tacos were okay as usual . nothing to write home about .
mexican	got them and boy what a disappointment as you can see from the picture you got more shell them meat , cheese or lettuce . and we didnt even get offered hot sauce and didn 't notice until we took our 12 pack home . not a cheap order but i see me trying del taco next time .
mexican	we have been to the others but no diffence what a change over a few months. service is ok . food bad . t.v. ' s not updated chicken supper dry beef dry.not returning save you 're money .
mexican	i wound up having the cactus margarita which i asked them to make with sauza and it has to down down as the worst top shelf margarita ... i realize times are tough all over but it tasted like lemonaid and if there was tequila in it i sure couldn 't taste it ..... won 't be coming back . we left there and went to sierra bonita where my expectations were more than met .... please check out the review .
mexican	multiple times i 've gone and they 've been out of something by mid-day . pay for chips and guacamole but you 're given a bag that 's not even half full of chips . they 'll only have one person putting together orders and no one cashing out so you 're waiting forever . i know they can do better .
mexican	how can they have reviews before chrismas ? the food was fresh , but the service ... what service ? they don 't know what they are doing ! glad to have a place with the o-k kosher symbol . for a visitor like me , i appreciate a " pita joint ' with international kosher symbol and reputation , instead of just one rabbi . i plan to review it in the future !
mexican	you have go back and have them fix it . plus , my food was thrown in my hand . it was fast as advertised but rude and definitely not accurate .
mexican	they add extra conditions to them that are not printed on them so they don 't have to honor them . when you ask to speak to a supervisor you get another member of the family so don 't expect a different answer .
mexican	but the stupid b at the register didn 't want to put beans in my friends burrito because they " don 't usually do that . " and on top of that she doesn 't speak spanish and has one of the back people take her orders .
mexican	the potatoes were big and unweidly and sorely undercooked . staff was not prepared for opening 30 minutes after opening time . the cashier was still moping the floor and the cook was in the back loafing and the chairs were still upside down on the tables . ordered chicken breakfast burrito , but chicken was heavily spiced and poor quality today and the whole burrito was a hot mess . at 6 bucks , it was clearly a ripoff .
mexican	although it has been offered off and on in other cities over the last 10 years , this latest offering , is the most over-priced crap to date . what is being called a breakfast burrito is not even the size of an egg roll and being priced as if it were a burrito supreme .
mexican	bring a fly swatter with you when you eat there there food has gone down hill since we last ate there not many customers at the time loooong wait , food was cold , never again
mexican	complete shit ! ! ! offered a refund and only refunded the metal laced bowl .
mexican	at least use styrofoam containers easier to pop in microwave smh next time i 'll go to rolando 's right up the street great food and they just scored an a rating in last inspection . i wonder what garcia 's scored ?
mexican	no , but seriously . we came for cinco de mayo , and yes we expected it to be busy . but we waited for 3 hours for our meal after we sat down . all the while other people were in and out . we had to ask our sever for water and to take our order . this place won 't last .
mexican	the lomo saltado was terrible . there was more fat on my steak than steak . the place was pretty slow ( only 3 tables being serviced ) and the waitress could not be any slower . not only could she not be any slower , she was also pretty rude . when our dishes were brought out she loudly kinda tossed them at the edge of the table and walked away to another table . our food came out before she remembered to bring the drinks , just didn 't get an overall good vibe about this place . i 'm glad i tried it and got the curiosity out of the way , but will not be a returning customer . best of luck !
mexican	carnitas were delicious but waaaaayyyy too salty . guacamole , veggie enchiladas , chips average . much better food places to eat in vegas .
mexican	the menu is ridiculously over priced . just because your building is new and expensive and your overhead is high doesn 't mean you should charge $ 20 for a gross cheese enchilada , taco , and chili rellano . chips were stale and cold . salsa was worse than pace or even great value brand . stick to lindo , you 'll be paying over $ 100 for a family of 4 .
mexican	nope . i 'm done . way better ways to spend $ 20 for lunch for 2 people . completely unimpressed . lackluster food .
mexican	we both ordered the margaritas and we could barely drink them they were so awful . i decided to try the sangria and it literally tasted like cough syrup . it was very thick and disgustingly sweet . i couldn 't even finish it . my friend had the tacos and she said they were " just ok . " i had the chicken burrito and mine was about the same . definitely nothing to rave about . neither of us will be back .
mexican	wasn 't very impressed . service was sub standard and prices were high for what we received . never had buritios from a restaurant that were that small and open ended eont be going back .
mexican	the place was just about empty at the peak of the lunch hour and now i know why . not that they have to be , but the cook and server were not puerto rican . i mention that because the food was absolutely flavorless . this is quite embarrassing if anyone comes here thinking they are eating puerto rican food . down to the side salad on the plate with no dressing , i had to pour the louisiana hot sauce over the rice and beans and pernil . food was not expensive so i didn 't have much heartache . good lesson to know , not a place to come back to .
mexican	terrible ! ... super sad my friends got sh ¡ tty colombian food . -one concerned colombian
mexican	got to the restaurant around 7 : 10 or 7 : 20 . waiter was so in-attentive it was embarrassing . it took forever to get water , then drinks , then refills . most mexican places serve your food so quickly you barely have a chance to enjoy a basket of chips . we went through 4 baskets and waited an hour for our food , keep in mind i took forever to get chip refills . i like to think i have appropriate expectations for food quality and service on a $ 10 meal but this was terrible . this was our 2nd time here and we won 't go back ! waiter was very rude and unaccommodating .
mexican	waiter told me it was freshly made and argued with me . wow ! i just finally told him to leave it and i pushed it to the side . 10 minutes later he brought some that was in fact fresh . beer wasn 't cold . nothing about the meals were good . pretty sad .
mexican	dirty food displays . all salsas had skins on them . ordered the salad and the gal put 9 limes on the salad . the pork container had lettuce and chunks of what not floating in it . i would pass on this one . . .
mexican	the carne asada in the beast burrito was trash . the elote was over priced but was the only saving grace to this god awful place my boyfriend and i tried on a whim . couldn 't get a drink refill for the life of me , but after i 'm finished with my meal the waitress decides to refill my drinks . $ 12 for a cardboard burrito . i enjoyed writing this painfully honest review more than i did the food . on the bright side if you love dubstep and terrible remixes of sam smith and adele you 'll fit right in with the try hard atmosphere .
mexican	45 minutes for a burrito and taco . no chip refill while waiting , two people running around like headless chickens. horribly understaffed , its saturday night ! ! ! ! we should have left but decided to wait it out. mistake . sadly we won 't be back .
mexican	mediocre food . tasted microwaved . way overpriced and service is minimal at most . i miss matta 's philly cheese steak burrito
mexican	we been slammed my water on the table and was extremely rude
mexican	( seniors eat for five dollars monday nights ) so we walked to the next restaurant over which was mi casa . the food is worse than chilli 's , and its more expensive . i got a carnitas chimmi , it tasted fine , but way too much salt for my liking ( and i really like salt ) . two stars because it was clean , service was ok , and the iced tea was a step above average . probably wont ever eat here again .
mexican	those two young hispanic girls should know we talk and understand spanish and by the way they talked was not professional . overall the food was great .
mexican	i normally love chipotle but today when i tried to order online , no carnitas was available . so i called and they said to just write in the comments that you want carnitas , asked if i could order on the phone and they said yes , hold on and never came back ! so ordered online following the instructions that were given to me and get back to my office and i have no carnitas ! argh ! !
mexican	came in here at least 3 times a month for the best margaritas and nachos . taco tuesday was a great deal too . now ... not so much . the taco tuesday deal is 3 for 5 ( chicken and pork only ) instead of 10 for 10 . the shrimp tacos are clearly frozen ( 3 for 7 on tue ) . better deals at long john silvers . the award winning margaritas are now mostly mixer . we had to add a shot to make them normal . all of the best bartenders and servers are gone now . management change ? who knows why this nose dive happened . very disappointed and not sure when we will be back
mexican	potle is potle . but you 'd think the meat is coming out of their own paycheck . makes me feel obligated to get lemonade in my water cup .
mexican	don 't trust what you put in your mouth here . i think management needs to reevaluate their staff .
mexican	i came in today ordered togo for two . the inside was busy and i did not want to take the last clean table to sit and wait . i was attempting to be courteous so i went and sat outside . after about 10 min i go in and ask her if she could have someone get me outside when my food is ready . she proceeded to raise her voice and explain that 's not the way it works here and i needed to hang out and wait for my number to be called . i will not step foot in again or refer any of my customers that are hungry to go there .
mexican	i was hungry and in no mood for confrontation so i took a couple of bites , and threw it in the trash . obviously canned beans . stick with the cheap burgers and wings ! it 's in a rough area , lots of cops heavily patrol the area , but it 's nostalgic and people still go there . not as good as it was back in the day .
mexican	very upsetting because they offer it free with purchase when you check in ! ! ! the girl taking order and payment seemed so disinterested and not friendly at all . the food was extra cheesy , so if you like lots of cheese on your food then it 's good , but the rice and beans were tasteless .
mexican	burnt coffee and a rude ( what i am guessing is a manager ) woman who spoke in spanish to insult me for no reason to another staff member , well sweetheart i guess because my skin is white you can 't tell who understands spanish and who doesn 't ... i 'm mixed you burra next time if you want to be rude you make sure and do it after the customer leaves ... estúpida
mexican	these guys gave me a virus and now i can 't even move . disgusting to even think how i got the virus but definitely positive it is from the food . it was the last thing i ate and the only thing i ate in the past 14 hours , have not been able to leave the bathroom for about 3 now .
mexican	come on , its arizona , there 's plenty of better places to get your burrito fix ...
mexican	asked if i could heat it up they say no . had to box up my food i just paid for and go home to microwave it . not much concern on the part of the employees .
mexican	rice , guac , etc spilling everywhere made it borderline inedible . i had to wipe down the outside of the burrito with napkins to be able to hold it without getting my hands all dirty . it is so simple to make a good quality burrito and being incompetent at wrapping it basically ruins the experience . line moved suuuuuper slow too . avoid this location .
mexican	burrito here is the worst i have had ... small and a little pricey. coming from california , im use to real impressive burrito = (
mexican	overpriced . barely any meat , choke full of rice ... for $ 12 , plus tax , plus tip = $ 16 . for rice wrapped in tortilla ? no thanks .
mexican	i 've been there dozens of times but i don 't like it anymore because he seems so negative . and lately he 's taken to getting your order then asking you to sit down . each time he has got something wrong .
mexican	disappointed especially because it was about nine bucks for a burrito that should be about four dollars . chipotle burritos are way better and cheaper . i got two different burritos , green chili and pork and carne asada , both way overpriced . i 'm thinking because they got popular on yelp and have a lot of caucasian customers they will charge more . well i think their popularity got to their heads . i don 't think i 'll come back . my burrito was too soggy by the way . good salsa good chips .
mexican	that said , the ingredients don 't taste super fresh . they were simply okay . prices are about $ 6 for specials or $ 8 for regular sized burrito . service wasn 't exactly friendly or welcoming which is kind of sad . burrito tasted okay , was a bit messy due to juices from salsa leaking out and taste was fine but not delicous .
mexican	burrito tasty but wet. literally a super wet liquid mess. maybe it was from the pinto beans .
mexican	$ 27 for 2 burritos , bottle of coke and fountain drink . no sides ! there are several other burrito places in the area that are great and won 't cost you a fortune .
mexican	didn 't feel good after eating - had a lot of salt
mexican	whoever says these burritos are like the ones in the mission either haven 't been to the mission or are just liars . the burrito had pico and sour cream but those were the only similarities shared with its nor-cal cousin . i like all the sf pics , but the burrito was meager just like all the other burritos in this dessert . i was so stoked too ! bummer . and good price ? i paid $ 7 for a carne asada " super " burrito . not bad , but with no leftovers not cheap either .
mexican	restaurant was clean . pop was cold . nice atmosphere . decorated well . staff are friendly but don 't check well on customer heat levels .
mexican	i requested light chorizo yet it was so overloaded i couldn 't see or taste the egg . wondering why they say they will make it with light chorizo and yet they never do . i 'd prefer you mention up front if there is no possibility in decreasing the amount used ..... this prevents setting one up for disappointment .
mexican	no more size options - there is only the large priced burrito at the regular size . little bit of a rip off , there . the oven was also broken when i last went , so it was heated on a hot-plate which left the tortilla soft and chewy , sort of gross . $ 9.80 for all mains ( tacos , quesadillas , burritos ) . a little much .
mexican	got seated in bar hoping for a bit faster service . not . took order fairly quickly but took 43 minutes to get two combo plates . waitress did provide 2x salsa ( good ) and chips ( mediocre ) and apologized for the delay . carnitas taco was ok , chicken enchiladas were bland . $ 3.75 25oz bud light made the wait somewhat better . pretty standard american mexican food .
mexican	we ordered only two entrée 's for the three of us i wasn 't that hungry good thing i didn 't order . the manchaca plate look good on the menu but we prefer our meals hot not luke warm or boarder line cold . ask for replacement or refire manchaca meal this time hot . we got our meal and it was hot hopefully it was a new meal and not just microwaved . we ask for corn tortillas on our first order which we did not get and we didn 't get on our refire and even the salsa . training for all staff may be in order when they 're slammed . asked for iced refill , didn 't get it either .
mexican	$ 15 for a " super " burrito and a water - the burrito was the size of a taco bell 7 layer burrito . sour cream and guac ? ? ? though ordered , they must have run through this burrito in track shoes because those ingredients were outta there . ya feel me ? ?
mexican	i love the food , drinks , location and vibe but i 'm giving up after being a regular customer for 3 months ! it 's gross . tables are sticky , railings and fixtures are covered in a thick layer of dust , the floors and stairs look like they have never been swept much less mopped . swarms of fruit flies around the dish return and trash cans . today the flies drove me to the competition and i won 't be back .
mexican	rip off . they were overly nice until i made them charge me the menu price
mexican	had two cerviche tacos , chile relliano .. rice beans .. $ 35.00 .
mexican	their prices are misleading ! they don 't have a menu with pictures to know what you mr paying for . i got 3 small ass tacos and a drink " they called a special " for $ 7.79 ! and a credit card fee of .50 $ so , with a small ass taco and small size drink all came to $ 8.92 ! should went to del taco and get a fiesta pack for less and more food ! oh ! also , they should add rice and beans to the order for the price your getting for . overall ! telling all friends and family not to attend any your restaurant . roberts is better ! !
mexican	you have managers serving food without proper attire . managers talking down to employees in front of customers . over charging for your orders . not to mention the hour long wait to get your food . management needs to be reviewed , and you might want to get a new set of employees .
mexican	this is the only mexican place that does not seem to know how much people love chips and salsa ! come on people put some salsa on the table ! what ever that is that you put on the table with chips ... its not enough ! ! ! they are not friendly ... orders are always messed up . filling drinks .... don 't happen here so order 2 at the start ! be careful when ordering they call thing by different names here ! save yourself the headache and go to another minivan place this one just isn 't worth it .
mexican	the chicken was dry , beans not seasoned at all and mac and cheese was watery . don 't waste your time with this place !
mexican	the bathroom was backed up and all over the mats . that set the tone of my experience there
mexican	beans were dry and meat was bland . my daughter wouldnt eat her " taquitos " gross meat with tiny tirtilla.service was limited it seemed as if none of the employees knew what to do .
mexican	i would have had better nachos at a run down tweeker 7 / 11 . i am pretty sure i just gave myself food poisoning . i am from el paso and i know good mexican food and this is far from it . none of the cheese was melted and they used can nacho cheese also .. you can totally tell the pulled everything out of a can .
mexican	very rude workers and even worse prices . the lady working saturday is the worst clerk i 've ever met .
mexican	an hour wait for food . chips lacked salt , salsa was bland and the iced tea was warm . no drink refills and no apologies when we finally demanded to go boxes . terrible , terrible food and completely overpriced . yuck . just yuck .
mexican	the serving was 1 / 4 of what i get at other places.i got more meat in high school and i was a nerd and a loner . it was so flat i thought it was an asian ass ! it seemed like michelle obama ate my nachos and i got the left overs . i would show pictures but i finished them by the time i got done writing this review . i was hungry don 't judge ! i will never go back to this filibertos again . i 'd rather drive 10 miles further to robertos . i would write more but but i 'm gonna go look for some more food .
mexican	many mexican places in town are half the price for the same items . yes it is gorgeous but still not worth the price . go to michoacán and save the money .
mexican	i 've had better service at burger king drive thru . host k , this was our first and last time at this establishment . i felt like i was an inconvenience and was being rushed while trying to order . keep in my this was my family 's 1st time . please don 't tap you nails or sigh deeply when people are right in front of you . it 's rude !
mexican	take forever getting your order and i never had a perfect order . always had to go back to get it corrected . please look at having at least one competent employee working the window .
mexican	there is clearly a management problem , all of the employees had an attitude that said they were trying to do as little as possible .
mexican	i could have easily went to a sit down mexican restaurant and been served quicker . half an hour later and still at the window waiting on my food . would have left a lot earlier but at a certain point you say " well i waited this long . " they need to get this place fixed !
mexican	average wait time per car in the drive thru at lunch ours is over five minutes . i had three cars in front of me and waited nearly 20 minutes , ridiculous ! . it 's always the same older indian lady at the window and she clearly gets flustered any time the have a few cars in the line . hire new staff !
mexican	i sat in the drive thru for 15 minutes ! wish i could say it was just this one time but this is the second time .
mexican	really frustrating to go into this place having been to many other locations knowing your order no matter what it is will be far less than what you 're used to if you enjoy burrito boyz . this location for me happens to be really close to home so i 'm unfortunately bound to it more often than not but it 's gotten to the point where i 'll just ignore this location and go elsewhere and be happy with what i paid for . overall it is run professionally and it is clean but the staff here have been trained to be cheap ass when it comes to making your food compared to other much more generous locations .
mexican	i 've been here twice , and it 's safe to say my visits were not anomalies : dry buns , dry beef , and a very small patty for the price . did i mention it took 20 minutes ? on a tuesday night ? won 't be going back - burrito boyz next door is a much better buy .
mexican	chips were stale and the sopes are horrible ! ! ! save yourself the $ $ $ and go to tacos el gordo instead ! ! ! !
mexican	did an online order had to wait forever . no one seemed to know what to do with themselves .
mexican	when i go to chipotle i always order a chicken burrito with peppers and hot salsa . you would think that it would be common sense not to drown someone 's burrito in salsa especially when it is their hottest flavor . if that is common sense , then the asian lady working their obviously has none . i was flabbergasted when watching them make my burrito to say the least . when watching them roll my burrito salsa was actually squirting out of the shell ! how is that of high enough quality to serve to a customer . this was my first time visiting this location and i am in every way never going again .
mexican	skimpy portions . soggy pico de gallo , brown guacamole . incorrect orders with pathetic apologies from a manager who seems to be a french fry or 2 short of a happy meal . i will not be patronizing this chipotle ever again . in short ? they blow . suck . don 't go . go to in-n-out or cane 's . don 't waste your money here . you might get sick . if i could give 0 stars that 's what i would do .
mexican	they are regularly out of ingredients . i stopped in at 11 : 15 ( they open at 11 ) and they were out of cheese . already ? obviously poor planning in management . also , customer service and portions are very unpredictable . workers seem annoyed that you are there . i work across the street so i 've experienced all of this numerous times . disappointed and has caused me to loose my craving for chipotle . not worth it .
mexican	on more than one occasion the employees have been extremely rude . they are constantly running out of items that should be prepped and ready for busy hours of the day . i 've also noticed their portions are substantially smaller than other chipotles i 've been too . i absolutely love chipotle but not pleased with this location .
mexican	i would rather drive to california for a decent taco and customer service .
mexican	a word to the wise stay away from this high school employed location especially an hour before closing time when all they care about is cleaning up and going home and you get old food . shame on you chipotle !
mexican	by far the worst don taco place i been to never will i ever go back to this place so lets start where the fd up # 1 i ordered carne asada fries and extra meat and cheese what i got was not extra meat and no extra cheese i opened the box to only see only a handful of food i can littearly hold the fries i got in one hand very disappointing i ended up giving food to dog # 2 there slasa was so watered down just disgusting never will go back to these place again inside was dirty one counter guy and a line full cars so they rush to make ur food se pasan de verga
mexican	terrible customer service and so very slow . no matter what time or day , i 'm waiting for at least 15 minutes . for a bagel ! ! the employees are dirty and dingy and even the store manager wears her hair down and hanging over the food as she makes it , disgusting . it 's a shame this is the only einsteins near me , i love the other locations , this one is hands down the worst .
mexican	the meat was overcooked . the place dirty and the customer service a joke . would not recommend this place . recommend the one on sahara . unfortunately the on trop has closed . stay away from this location .
mexican	we walk in and aren 't greeted by anyone and the place is a complete mess ! the employees are just hanging around talking . we realize that there isn 't very much of anything left , being that it was 8pm we figured they would be bringing out more , but nope . we asked the employee and she said they aren 't making anymore food and suggest we go somewhere else . she then looked at my boyfriend and said " she 's too pretty to eat here just take her somewhere else " the girls behind the counter were extremely rude and unprofessional .
mexican	my husband and i have been coming for years . i was shocked to see one of the managers named lauren wrote her number on one of the receipts when my husband took our kids to eat . i hope they find better employees .
mexican	they don 't accept credit , charge to use your debit card , and is always dirty . not to mention the rude staff and homeless that loiter outside . avoid at all costs .
mexican	always over a 20-25 min wait in line . then when you get up to order they 're always out of product . i would rather drive 20 min to another location than go this one . countless times rice is under cooked , out of queso , out of grilled chicken , out of salsa . whatever is going on should be fixed fast . if youre on a lunch break dont go here . if you want what you ordered dont go here . the only thing i can say is it has a clean lobby
mexican	you can never go here and get your order made right ! we go to this one because it 's 5 minutes from the house but i 'm officially boycotting it . del taco across the street is what it 'll have to be on lazy days i don 't feel like cooking for the kids .
mexican	it only gets the 2nd star because the service was decent probably due to being one of three people in here . the salsa had no flavor and looked like vomit . tried to doctor it with their hot sauce to no avail . chicken enchilada tasted like bumblebee tuna drenched in ranchero sauce that tasted like tomato soup with a touch of hot sauce . steak burrito had no flavor and was the size of a taco . rice and beans are the same the burrito ... no flavor ! as i received the bill an ant crawled across the table ! awful place ! awful experience !
mexican	not much flavor , runny beans , gross appearance and taste . i won 't go back . wondering how it 's stayed in business for so long . there are many other mexican restaurants in town . try them instead of this one ! ! best mexican the canadians have ever had , maybe . one word review . yuck ?
mexican	ordered four items , two of the items were wrong . order a chicken chimichanga and got beef . ordered a breakfast burrito and got something else ...... not sure what ! tried to call the number on the receipt numerous times to let them know and get replacements and no one answers the phone ! terrible service !
mexican	the horchata was too watered down . the pupusas weren 't fully cooked and slow service
mexican	don 't bother placing an order online . you 'll end up standing around the counter for 30 minutes while they keep forgetting to make your order . unbelievable and unacceptable .
mexican	they literally wanted to charge me $ 4.99 for their version of fried ice cream ... it was cornflakes ( some soggy ) sprinkled on top 1 scoop of ice cream ? ? ? ? ? it wasn 't fried at all . do not waste your money here . wow
mexican	waited 25 minutes in the drive thru line , paid and was asked if i wanted sauce then had to wait longer still . i had to ask for sauce tho i was asked when i gave my money . no napkins either . i will never return to this location and will recommend others don 't either .
mexican	we had to wait around 23 minutes in order for us to get our order through the drive-through . this will be the only and last time that i ever come to this location .
mexican	i sat at the table for 43 minutes before anyone acknowledged me , and that was only after a friend complained about the service . the manager was rude ... i 've had better service at taco bell ! will never return , and will tell everyone with a pulse to avoid this place ! ! ! i would have ordered food , but since it took almost 45 minutes to get a drink ... i didn 't bother and left for a place more customer friendly
mexican	) who 's calls here self a manager while playing behind the counter with some guy spraying body spray all over him while people are eating 2 feet in front of her . and since we interrupted her play time we got all her attitude & even with her shitt face we still tried to order and even there food was bad so over cooked ! ! meat tasted like it was a few days old ! just disgusting ! ! definitely a big disappointment . ratings on this place should be a big f ! !
mexican	service is slower then molasses , crew spends more time talking amongst themselves then working on orders and they 're always out of something .
mexican	this is american mexican food there 's a difference . i came here because my mom enjoys this type of food verses the real thing and it was her birthday so i had to please her . she liked it . i hated it . i ordered the shrimp tacos ...... disgusting . they use frozen shrimp and you can taste it . the corn tortillas they came on tasted like cardboard and then of coarse they added a tartar sauce which is watered down and gross as well . i will not ever eat here again .
mexican	ugh , dirty , unfriendly and no smells of good food ! i will never return , not even to a cali location ! i messaged restaurant about our miserable treatment , apparently they don 't respond ! fillbertos all day , every day over this place ! ! !
mexican	food not that great either ... but you go in and the dude at the register looks at you like he wants to fight , i 'd slap the shit outta him if i wasn 't with my fam , you try and decide what you want and he acts impatient . i even looked at the employees in the back and they all look pissed off too ! could be b / c it was 100 degrees outside and their ac wasn 't on . they shouldn 't stay open 24 hrs , this place blows
mexican	came with lemon peel . cheese enchiladas are unremarkable . service is less than stellar . prices are strip prices for bland , uninspired mexican .
mexican	however , this location is the worst . we used to go about once a week but it is just so painfully slow . we started ordering online , and eating it there , in order to cut back on the time it takes . sadly , even that was messed up . they almost always had items missing from the order , or something wasn 't prepared right . we still go from time to time but not nearly as often as we used to . the lunch service seems to be much better than the dinner service .
mexican	when ordering online , don 't expect your food to be made until you get there . make sure to check it or you will get home and find out your order is wrong !
mexican	there are better mexican food places , at more affordable prices and the service is typical of fast casual dining ilk . if you 're going to go , i suggest the tacos but be sure to ask for salsa or you 'll have absolutely minimal flavor and zero heat .
mexican	i ordered online , about an hour ahead and the food still wasn 't ready when i arrived . the girl at the order pickup window did not acknowledge me as she was speaking to her boyfriend , and wasn 't until the manager came over that i received any attention . the manager was polite , apologized for the inconvenience and offered me a free drink , but i won 't be back .
mexican	i keep going back to this one and continually upsetting myself knowing yet hoping it might be different . sadly it never is . long or short line it just seems to take forever and is oddly different from other cafe rio 's . the employees don 't seem to care like they hate their job . food is amazing since it 's a chain it 's pretty much the same at all of them but the staff is the reason for the rating .
mexican	for over a year now , either the drink machines have been broken , or staff is too lazy to refill them . ( i 'm inclined to go with the latter . ) on our last visit , we ordered a steak quesadilla . three ingredients . i 'll let you take a guess at which one was missing . while they remade the quesadilla , this is just what 's expected from this location . long wait times , indifferent staff , half of what they advertise that makes them unique unavailable .
mexican	this location though is absolutely terrible . they hire their employees straight from the gutter . none of them can smile , they all argue at each other in front of customers and are just rude . guy asking if i want rice and beans and he 's already putting them on my salad and gets irritated when i say no rice .. like it 's an inconvenience he jumped ahead of himself on something i didn 't want . if i didn 't love the food so much i would never be back , but luckily for me there are other better locations . this one takes the cake for the worst cafe rio location in vegas .
mexican	multiple visits , and essentials are missing . something is consistently out , items like steak , grilled chicken , drinks , queso , salt . the staff is usually peppered with an employee or two that are indifferent , or rude ... i am reluctant to mention this due to the common ' excellent ' employee who is aware and apologetic . hard to look the other way when this is a trend here . this location is close by , and i keep coming back but never again . i will be going elsewhere . 2 stars because of tha name and food is good . thank you .
mexican	the one star review is based solely on the terrible coustomer service at this location . it seems like there 's no manager on duty . the lady running the register was sitting down talking to other employees . after a few minutes of just standing there i said excuse me can i pay for my meal ? the girl seemed very irritated that she had to come help me . i almost walked out and left the food . i will not be going back here .
mexican	when i tried in the past i thought it was decent , but this time , lettuce , rice and all other ingredients were very dry . so disappointing . i don 't know how they could overlook it . go to chipotle .
mexican	they don 't put much in the salads , and it doesn 't taste fresh . they are pretty nice with the customer service but the food , i 'm not impressed with .
mexican	but this location is absolutely horrible . 9 times out of 10 i will go in and they are either rude , obnoxious , out of things , or just slow . i keep going to it because i live in the area and i hope it gets better . but it hasn 't . it needs new management and a completely new staff .
mexican	not a one time problem , every time , it takes this location 3-4 times as long to clear a line than any other location i 've visited . if you ever do get your food , it should be pretty good ... but that 's a big if .
mexican	go ahead , i 'll wait ... oh wait , you can 't find it because it doesn 't freakin exist . so why the hell is your barbacoa sweet ? ! the food is garbage , the service is garbage , cafe rio is garbage . just go dumpster diving instead of eating here . yuck . there is nothing else to say .
mexican	fries were hard and the carne asada had a weird taste . breakfast burrito was even bland . will never return ! yuck ! !
mexican	( very bad location , imo . ) the food was positively delicious and accurate of the southern-ca. style of casual mexican food ... edgar , the former owner of " taco loco " in the south side apparently took the lease over and has in the process , raised the price of everything $ 2-3 while at same time , managed to reduce the quality of food . i had high hopes but was very disappointed after trying , recently . ( a couple friends have relayed similar feelings . )
mexican	tried to get some california style burritos and they were closed 3 hours before they were supposed to close .
mexican	went in to pick it up hours before our party and was told 1 ) cody had only quoted an estimate , and now it the real price was 50 % higher and 3 contianers less than we ordered . also not ready just after 1pm . took 20 minutes going back and forth with kitchen manager nile who aparantley has no authority to fix issues . we have people coming so we had to walk out with 2 / 5th of my original order . to get through today and will not rest on this farse . i order catering every few months for my company at the norterra location for employee appreciation never been treated like this . not anymore though .
mexican	employees are kind of rude . managers are a waste of $ they actually just walk around and do nothing . the cooks are the only ones working hard . when they finally answered to take my order they said 25 mins well it actually was 45 mins to make 3 tacos lol . they need to rehire a whole new staff w the exception of the cooks . that 's why i gave 2 stars cause the food tasted so good . hire managers , servers , and hostesses that actually smile . nobody wants to pay to see resting bitch face . my tacos were very good . el jeffe was delicious . i recommend barrio , just not this location .
mexican	i felt rushed and was talked to as if i was doing them a favor . was so offended that i 'll never eat there or recommend there food to anyone . also food is not great just to mention
mexican	was told midnight for this location but got there at 11 and they were already closed .
mexican	wish if they were running low on everything else they would have mentioned that when i called , think that 's a pretty important thing to mention when someone calls and asks , why else would i be calling if not because i was heading over to pick stuff up . thank you for wasting an hour of my time .
mexican	showed up at 10pm for drinks and food before a show and the kitchen was closed .
mexican	why accept calls for orders when we have to wait 20 more mins ? ! ? ! ? ! makes no sense. anyone knows another cheap place for pupusas ? this place just stakes too long for an order .
mexican	i did not call late , it was 5 pm on a monday . i guess order your tacos on any other day but monday .......
mexican	got there and was told they don 't have my order . i verified i had called the right one , and apparently they just hadn 't bothered logging my order . fine , mistakes happen . but the guy behind the counter decided to be a jerk about it instead of trying to make it right . last time i eat here .
mexican	this place definitely needs to figure out a better system . i understand the volume of customers they have and how packed it can get ( line up out the door ) . however you 'd think the place would be a bit more organized . figure it out burrito bozo 's
mexican	got a cold tortilla with cheese that wasn 't melted . sat down to eat and was chastised by owner for not ordering " for here " on the phone . he told me my soda would cost $ 1 more . i asked why . he said if you take food to go , you fill up once and leave . if you sit and eat , you get free refills . i said , well , it 's not free if it costs a dollar more . won 't come back .
mexican	i had to ask for a gentle man there to take my order and he took my order fine all at once . went in to pay & she was rude at check out . food was not as good as the locations in chandler & mesa .
mexican	was told by cashier that i had to wait in a line that was at least ten people deep . the reason i called it in was to just grab and go . i see no reason to wait behind ten people who haven 't even ordered yet . to just pay and pick up me order that i called in and was waiting for me in the window . i called because again i only have thirty mins for lunch . will never recommend or come back to phatfranks .
mexican	he says , " all we have is a shrimp burrito . " i say , " well ..... i thought there was garlic shrimp . " he says , " oh yeah , there 's that and the burrito . i agree to the garlic shrimp even though i wanted ranchero . but , david insisted that it doesn 't exist . i get there and see ranchero on the menu . i was totally pissed and the level of customer service was so low that i never return . to add insult to injury , david says he 's the manager . pitiful !
mexican	ordered 2 burritos and carne asada fries . they told me it would be ready in 10 min . arrived art 3 : 40 . as i was paying the cashier told cook to make order . it 's now 4pm 30 min late and i 'm waiting for order . there was 4 customers in restaurant when i arrived ... the whole point of calling in order is to eliminate or reduce wait time . ridiculous .
mexican	arrive 1 day later and was told i didn 't need to come in . smh the manage didn 't even verify my card . he gave me attitude then walked away . i was planning on returning , now not so much .
mexican	so i still had to wait for my food the entire time which defeated the purpose of me calling in . food is average , it 's like any don tortaco / roberto 's out there . i still come here though since it 's a convenient location right next to the s jones exit of the 215 . it 's also 24 hours so it 's very useful .
mexican	she was not only disrespectful to me but also to others as i could hear her shout in the background . i usually don 't do this but i will be calling corporate for sure . horrible customer service ! ! !
mexican	the girl i spoke with told me they couldn 't put veggie fajitas into a bean burrito . any mexican restaurant i go to that 's what i get and its never been a problem . she told me she 'd have to ask and when i told her i would wait she paused for 2 seconds and said they can 't do that . she told me i could order a veggie wrap which is just a salad in a spinach tortilla - no thank you ! if i wanted that i would have asked for that . i ended up getting what i wanted at caramba 's fresh mexican food .
mexican	hostess over the phone asked what kinda sauce i wanted with the el hefe . wow , i 've never been asked , so i said red and extra sauce if they could do it . low and behold , red sauce buck fifty . extra sauce buck fifty . took food back for a refund . don 't ask for upgrades if you don 't say it costs more . it may be extra money if you get people to add on to their order , but let them know ahead of time .
mexican	a carne asada burrito doesn 't take 1 / 2 hr , especially when delivery is less than a quarter block . unacceptable , i cancelled the order . don 't waste your time ordering from them , there 's better mexican places .
mexican	he is hispanic . well , the girl that answered had no clue , not only that she said she didn 't know if they had them . really ? you 're turning down nicely damn clown ! oh well , i guess my teacher will get another gift certificate . i ended up buying a gift card to bj 's ! ! they loved it ! ! ! toodles
mexican	called to place a pick up order for 4 tacos , the total was $ 16 and change , tacos shouldn 't cost that much , you need to lower your prices
mexican	called back and they left the phone off the base and there 's a busy tone which means 20 minutes later no customer service . don 't call in to put a order .
mexican	finally ordered food . arrived to pick up food and was told that i ordered for the following day . i ordered for the day of . female member of staff finally figured out her mistake they took 30 minutes to figure out the order . offered nothing for not being able to do their job . food was as ordered when finally ready . never again at this location . bad staff
mexican	this food just doesn 't taste good .. and there was an eyelash in my queso .. kind of unsettling .
mexican	i would say this one is on par with grand electric but mexican amigos is much better . i don 't like feeling cramped , or not being able to sit with all my friends because of resto size issues . this and grand electric are more trendy queen west type of vibes . the food selection is slim - really just assortments of tacos .... but at mexican amigos there is a wider range , like chimichangas , ceviches , enchiladas , burritos etc .
mexican	very disappointed ! why did u mess with the ceviche recipe ? it was perfect before . guess i 'll have to pinterest and find the old recipe and make it myself . ivan still pouring awesome margaritas . mahaloz brah !
mexican	while i was eating my beans i suddenly saw a screw and asked the lady that worked there . they had the guts to get mad and thought i sabotaged my fave food that i always order . they seem to not care when i talked to them about the issue . i feel like the health inspector should be checking this place . i didn 't get to take a picture since my friend went and grabbed it away from me to talk to the manager .
mexican	are you people dumb or what ? ? ? ? these are the most terrible tacos i have ever tried in my life ! taco bell tacos are better than this ! by the time you pay they are super cold .. why is it always so packed ? ? ! ! i do not understand you las vegas people : /
mexican	long wait for the box too . my order was correct on the screen , but it took a while at the window for four items . i ordered a loaded potato grilled and instead got some beef chalupa of some sort , but i got everything else . my empanada was pretty soft and my spicy potato taco was lukewarm when i got it . doubt i return , it seemed pretty bad based on that service interaction .
mexican	my second time here and we were ignored after being seated ... waited 15 minutes until we were finally greeted . tacos were cold & bland .. but table side guac was good .... ( hence the 2-stars ) . for a $ 60 meal , i honestly don 't think i 'll be back .
mexican	no steak . my husband doesn 't eat any of their meats except the steak . we were told we could wait twenty minutes for them to make more . there was enough " left " to make one scrawny taco that cost five dollars for steak , cheese , and sour cream . unacceptable . we won 't be back unless something seriously improves .
mexican	hope to try it , but closing when all are off work ... to be continued . okay , we went back to try it , got a little of everything and honestly it wasn 't that good . i was sad that there was hardly any filling in any of the tamales . oh well , we won 't go back ( which makes me sad because i love to support the mom and pop shops ! )
mexican	they said they didn 't have any , he showed me they cleaned the station . they close at 10pm . lazy employees , trying to cut corners .
mexican	you 're suppose to be open until 10pm ... clearly this is not the case . this is terribly customer service ! i will never be coming back .
mexican	that being said , our esteemed del taco employee somehow managed to mess up the order despite everything being correct on the receipt . how one does this i am entirely unsure .
mexican	service is awful . the waitress could careless about guest unless your a single guy or guys . i ordered a torta and she said it came with rice and beans and it did not . not to mention it tasted awful i couldn 't even eat it . ten bucks of nothing . than you order chips salsa and gauc for nine bucks ya not worth it . my husbands buger was fine but he was so upset i was unhappy he didn 't want to eat . over all wouldnt recommend unless you like bad service or hey if your a single man who wants a fourty your old woman to give you a lot of attention .
mexican	i won 't be back , too bad i was hoping for a good option close to work .
mexican	customer service is still great , but the quality of the food is not good when you take it to go . i understand it 's due to the lard they use to cook. but it just doesn 't hold up well . i got the california burrito , asada fries and two tacos . i did see the owner getting very upset with everybody that rated them one star and i hope he doesn 't freak out on me and just take this as something to work on . this place could be great but came up short ..
mexican	this time i tried the camarones culichi and a dozen of fresh oyster on the half shells ... camarones culichi ... the sauce is pretty good ! however , it was overpriced as hell .... it was a small bowl portion with 6 shrimps in a bowl of sauce and some cheese sprinkled on top . way too expensive for a 15.99 $ oysters came out okay but to my surprised there was no cocktail sauce nor horse radish . it was only oysters and lime ..... - _ - you can imagine how fishy the taste is . 16.00 $ cocktail was good as last time . $ 15.99 we don 't get complimentary ceviche this time : ( i wonder why
mexican	5pm and zero customers . this should have been my warning . my lemon in the water was already squeezed and that scares me . ordered taco salad and a 16 $ chimichanga . had leftovers and left them there . very sad excuse for mexican food . salsa was good .... but the " hot salsa " tasted like water . waiter said that was the only hot sauce they had . what mexican restaurant doesn 't have tapatio or cholula . ? regardless we left a 30 % tip and left it at that !
mexican	mediocre restaurant overall : appetizers were disappointing tho the tacos were good . cocktails were awesome .
mexican	buuuut they lied . it was ok , i got the steak tacos and they were pretty skimpy , 2 small pieces in each . the rice and black beans were bland . the salsa was pretty flavorful so of course i drenched my food in it . i wouldn 't recommend this place but i wouldn 't tell anyone not to come if they wanted . i think i would give them another try and get something different . but better than chipotle ... i think not !
mexican	they said it was a mistake and would not honor it . they did give a 10 % off but it was less than half what it should have been . i got the carne asada burrito . it was big and looked great at first . it would have been very good except the steak was overcooked and dry . my fiancé got beef tacos which were fried too long so the beef was like jerky . my son got the chicken enchiladas which he said were alright but not great . the salsa was the best part . not a place we will return to .
mexican	i ordered a lil naked bowl and left not satisfied . portions are not great for the price you pay although the food tasted pretty good . i prefer burrito boyz - much better by far ! !
mexican	we waited in the drive thru for 25 minutes for pozole ! they didn 't even come to check in and say hey it 'll be a few more or have any decency instead they were rude and ignored us , i would of left if they didn 't have my debit card . their customer service is garbage even under new management . they didn 't even greet us they just said the total and stuck their hand out for payment . do no recommend this place to anyone their food isn 't worth the disrespect .
mexican	food service was terribly slow at the bar but the food was good . i would give the food 4 stars but service at the bar is awful .
mexican	the decor and ambiance are nice , the temperature was much too warm with what felt like no ac , just a small electric vertical fan . the service was mediocre . took a long time for drink refills or needed to ask more than once . of our party they forgot to take the order for two people . chips tasted stale and like old oil , salsa was ok . the nachos were sent back due to flavor of oil and ordered something different .
mexican	several people with no reservation were seated before us and they left before we were even seated ! the managers were so rude & the hostesses were acting as if we were a bother to them . when we said we were leaving to go somewhere else they all of a sudden had a table ready .. & offered us complimentary margaritas ... to the teens in our group .. very disappointed . on a lighter side , at least the food came out faster than expected .
mexican	beans and tortillas . canned beans . mission brand thick flour tortillas . " manager " came out and argued with us . swore on her father 's grave the beans were not canned . i 'm checking the trash . they are canned beans . so disappointed .
mexican	the good : location , atmosphere the bad : the food was awful , it was all lukewarm . 3 for 12 tiny , bland , cold tacos . lukewarm queso fondido . the mediocre : the drinks were okay , although my first one was replaced due to a piece of hairy fibre in it ... i was still charged . i would never come back here , i would never recommend .
mexican	we did not stay for a meal , but the chips and salsa with the $ 6 extra for guacamole were not worth the $ 12 . 2 stars for a bad happy hour experience , but can 't say anything about the food .
mexican	we had a quesadilla ... it was basically a microwaved tortilla with grease and a little cheese some cheap salsa and a couple chunks of chicken ... not great ! i probably won 't come back .
mexican	sangria was fine enough . chips and guacomole were clearly store bought .
mexican	people were on their way out but there were dirty trays and left over food everywhere . after brining up other people 's tray after ordering , noticed people were getting their food after me and those who got food before me . waiting for 45 mins in a filthy restaurant is definitely a good reason not to come back . thank goodness there 's a burrito boy 's just up the street !
mexican	ordered taco salad . when i was asked what kind of dressing , i should 've known to change my order . taste was blah , too much beans , no salsa . meat tasted like taco bell 's taco . not impressed at all . 1 star for food . service was average , 3 stars .
mexican	nice clean place , friendly staff ... but food was a disappointment and prices were outrageous . ex : a can of diet coke was $ 3.00 ! after chips and salsa , a can of diet coke , and a plate of carne ( about 6-8 ounces ) my bill after tip was over $ 30 ! the food was a bit bland . expected the carne asada to be amazing at $ 19 and i left half on the plate . very gross . go to chipotle across the walkway and save $ 20 .
mexican	tacos and burritos we had were very poor quality . like store bought and zapped in microwave . service was very good though so they get a second star for their staff .
mexican	total bust . got the tostada salad and the quesadilla . not exaggerating here- it was gross . the lettuce was wilted and brown and soaked in dressig . the quesadilla was supposed to have a bunch of fajita veggies including roasted corn and it was just filled with undercooked onions . the waitress was constantly trying to up-sell us . the one star is for the chips , which were delicious . other than that , it was a bad and overpriced experience .
mexican	my husband had to ask the bartender if we were going to get our drinks which had been sitting on the counter that whole time we were waiting , very frustrating . the food is average american mexican food , nothing amazing but not horrible . just basic flavors and basic choices . the service definitely needs some attention from management , for being at the mgm i would expect service to be the top priority . when our waiter saw my husband getting our own drinks from the bar , she didn 't even bat an eye or apologize ... save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else on the strip .
mexican	not sure how this place got so many good reviews . the salsa was terrible ! a good mexican restaurant should always start off with good homemade salsa and chips , apparently not this place : / my ice tea was nasty , and my plate was a bit too salty . this place is not your authentic mexican food . service was prompt but that 's about it . should 've had a burger instead else where .
mexican	came from surprise with wife and was excited to try the burger and mexican street corn ... guess what they don 't serve it at this location and they also don 't serve street tacos here either ... felt like i was getting an overpriced in and out burger ... $ 2.99 for a large drink and the small drink was $ 2.49 for my wife ... two hamburgers and two drinks one fry $ 22.19 plus tax ... disappointed after consulting with my wife we were talking about our experience and the lack of taste of the burgers ... she said she would rather lick one of our cats feet after it got out of the litter box
mexican	came here 2 years ago , they had just opened for the day we walked in and 3 people in the back seen us come in , not one came up to greet us , after one minute we walked out tried again yesterday and the same thing , wtf , go up the street to the real one , i hope these two aren 't related
mexican	there wasn 't a lot of people in there and only had 1 waitress . we got our food before we even got chips and salsa . the salsa tasted old . we also ordered 2 micheladas which never even got to the table . we asked 2 for them and she never brought them . the food was good , but not the service .
mexican	i 'm rating casanova a 2 . 1 start for the tasty food & the other for the location & decor of this small restaurant . otherwise the waiter didn 't acknowledge us most of the time , the food came out wrong , we waited about 25 min for our order which is ridiculous for 4 pastas & a restaurant with about 30 tables . when we asked to speak to the manager he took our complaint as a joke . we will never return & i don 't recommend it either unless you don 't mind putting up with that crap .
mexican	the first time the wait was so long just to get like 5 tacos . the second time , we figured we would order via the phone and then just pick up our order to go . alexa got our order completely wrong and we still had to wait . the food is good for the most part if you have lots and lots of time to kill to wait for your food . but we probably won 't be going there again .
mexican	we had been told they had good food & drinks . i should have checked the reviews - my bad . this place blows ! the service was nearly nonexistent , the salsa was bland , the servings were tiny , but at least the chips were stale ...
mexican	all the lights were off , so i was sketched out about stopping by , even though the hours are " 24 / 7 . " proceeded to the drive thru and was actually greeted with a " can i take your order " in broken english . i made my simple burrito order , moved on to the pay / pick up window . waited for about 20 mins and no body responded or showed up . sooooo , disappointing , since filiberto 's is supposed to be a 24 / hr mexican food place , which i usually enjoy . i won 't be spending my hard earned mula here anymore . take it from me , this location is a joke ..
mexican	it is 8 am in the morning on weekday , one cashier working and there are over 20 people in the line . are you kidding me ? ! avoid !
mexican	this place is a dupe of nandos chicken , but the sauces are different . wait time for food is around the same as nandos . chicken was fresh , but the sauces were not tasty , sauce makes a difference for me . worth a try .
mexican	we talked a lot about shawarmas so we decided to check this place out after seeing their sign . that $ 9.99 for 2 shawarma deal is lunch only . normal price is $ 6 each . chicken was meh . and the guy was very stingy with the meat . not worth it at all . i ordered samousas afterwards ( 2 for $ 3.50 ) and those were meh too . cheap ? more like a rip off . i have had cheaper and tastier shawarmas before .
mexican	i on the other hand can 't say i cared for it . i 'm not saying it 's terrible but it just wasn 't for my favorite place to eat in las vegas , but it looks like a lot of other people love it so they 're obviously doing something right . right off the bat i wasn 't crazy about waiting in different lines for different tacos and then waiting again to pay so by the time i sit down my tacos aren 't hot anymore . other than that it 's ok ...
mexican	next time im in brampton ill try not to eat a burrito especially at burrio boys and wait till i get back to cali
mexican	have to to say it was just awful and dry . no flavour , didn 't look appealing and tastes of nothing ! started eating our burritos and nether of us could take more than two bites . it was disgusting . so we just threw our food away and left . i think the only good thing i can say about this place is if you are vegetarian you have more choices here. and it was expensive $ 13 ....
mexican	well someone saw us , but quickly walked away and never came up to the window . needles to say , we drove off without food . good thing too , we found some great food at la pasadita hot dogs !
mexican	orders the fish tacos and i was so disappointed you have no idea . look at the portion of fish you get its like half a fillet of fish cut into 6 pieces lol its comical . you can 't taste the fish when you eat it hand to god . also the batter on the fish was way too rock hard crunchy it ruined the taco . the toppings inside included a bit of coleslaw which i usually don 't like but it was good and 2-4 pieces of diced tomato and green onion . you know you have a problem wth your taco when you taste the tortilla more than the actual inside toppings . save your $ 12 and just go to chipotle ! !
mexican	i don 't mind a good late night filibertos run but yuck this was yucky . the rolled tacos were and always are stale and they taste like the oil in the machine needs to be changed . i used to work in a kitchen and i can tell . place is dirty and old . never coming to this location again , and it smelled inside and out .
mexican	stuffed cabbage had no flavor . will have to give another dish a try next time just to see .
mexican	our party consisted of my husband , 10 yr old daughter & myself . i found the food " meh ... , " pretty bland - until you put some of the sauce on it . my 10 yr old wasn 't a fan of her bean & cheese burrito & ended up just peeling the tortilla off of it and eating that . i 'm not saying that the food was horrible or even bad , it just wasn 't the best i 've had . the staff was friendly and looked like they enjoyed working with each other .
mexican	margaritas were great , food was bland . very disappointed .
mexican	disappointed ... i do have a slight shellfish allergy so didn 't try and shrimp dishes but got the combo fajitas and they were at best mediocre . the beef was suspect . i did really like the salsa that came when i first sat . that was the highlight . the live music was imo way too loud and unfortunately not good at all . i can appreciate a live band but unfortunately i just didn 't feel it .
mexican	food was ok , at best . i had the chicken tacos , which were rather bland . even vida vida was better . chips were pretty good , though !
mexican	not the greatest food - it tastes like if chevy 's had a fast food company that was completely packaged . seriously , very bland . i would say come here for the drinks , but i ordered one mimosa without asking how much it was and it was more than the two meals we got combined - $ 16.00 . the service is friendly and the restaurant is clean so that 's really how this place earned its stars . i would skip this place unless you really want the restaurant feel while waiting for your flight . if you just want a bite to eat , you might want to consider another eatery .
mexican	i ordered a burrito and some tacos and pretty much had to force myself to finish it . the chips that came with my meal were the only enjoyable part !
mexican	this place is like a copy cat of chipotle but with much less flavor and all the fixings are extra . will not be going back .
mexican	only reason i didn 't give just one star is because the lunch prices were reasonable and our waitress was a gem- friendly , opinionated about things on the menu and quick . first , didn 't care for the salsa . tasted like stewed tomatoes from a can . nothing special . my husband , however , did like it . the food was mediocre at best . my beans were tasty , but the rice was flavorless and the chicken on my taco tasted like it had no seasoning ( flavor ) in it . pretty bland food . my husband liked his super burrito though and said that its more bland than what we 're used to because its ' authentic ' mexican food .
mexican	sadly it didn 't live up to expectations . our server was about 12 years old , he was nice but didn 't write down our order so of course the food wasn 't right . had to ask for refills numerous times . fish tacos were okay . no salsa / sauce of any kind offered for tacos .
mexican	i paid $ 12 for a carne asada combination plate and the meat resembles dog food . i admit the salsa is ok but a burrito from a gas station would have been about as satisfying as this meal . there are much better options in the area than this !
mexican	.. but me and my husband were totally disappointed we both got soggy tostadas . the ceviche had no flavor . oh and we had our son with us the server didn 't even ask if we wanted a drink for him . just bad service and food . first and last time going .
mexican	i ordered the ceviche de camaron chalupita . it was pretty much aguachiles instead of ceviche since it was so spicy , but it was still good . my bf ordered a coctel ... i think it was called la reyna and it had pretty much everything in it but he had to add ketchup because he said it lacked flavor . unfortunately it bf got sick and was up all night throwing up . he was sick all weekend from the food . i guess it wasn 't such a good coctel after all . hopefully no one else has gotten sick but be careful when going to this place .
mexican	it didn 't have to coolness of the original el encanto and the setting was not as interesting . it took quite a while for our waitress to come to our table , we had to ask for refills , and the food was lackluster . green chile had no taste / heat - my son ( 17 months ) accidentally got a bite of green sauce and never batted an eye . we will stick with the original el encanto at least the vibe is better there .
mexican	for being a mexican restaurant , how can you butcher frejoles ? well , this place did just that along with the carne asada . it looked like kibbles n bits and didn 't have a good flavor . the tray with condiments looked like it was in the fridge for a long time and slightly welted . on to what i did like . the birria was very good and had good flavor . what else did i like ? ..... um , the salsas weren 't that bad either . wasn 't much to complement here . so , this place will not get a second chance to redeem themselves . oh well , right ?
mexican	was expecting to walk into great customer service and a fun atmosphere instead i walked in wondering if they were even open ! staff was extremely unhelpful and made me feel like i was being a burden to them ! food was way overpriced and not that great . only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that my 11 year old liked it . save your time ( and money ) and go to chipotle down the street .
mexican	ended up paying $ 16 for 3 tacos , corn , and a mexican soda . after spending that much money i expected it to turn out great but meat ended up tasting sweet and funny compared to the meat on the tacos . friend had the carne asada fries and picked out all the meat from it . corn on the cob didn 't even look or tasted well at all what a shame
mexican	came here for 2 bowls .. what a shame .. i kept asking for extra and he wouldn 't give it to me and just ignored me .. then got annoyed when i told him if he can add extra steak ... the bowls were so small not like a regular chipotle .. waste of money and time ... don 't get annoyed at people when your suppose to do a simple job .
mexican	first started off with waiting 20 mins for stale chips , that came in paper bag and salsa that tastes like tomato purée . then watched our $ 18 chicken burritos sit on the tray outside the kitchen for 10 mins , brought to us , chicken cold . waitress never checked on us . nasty food . major mistake . will never recommend this restaurant to anyone one ! no star worthy .
mexican	points for accommodation ! that 's as good as it gets really . some of the tapas we ordered were good , but what 's disappointing was the paella . and that 's really disappointing since that 's what they 're supposed to be known for ! the flavour just wasn 't there . there was a lot of seafood but it was just bland . as great at as the service and atmosphere was , i wouldn 't go back .
mexican	restaurant was mostly empty but service was very slow . server was argumentative when one order came out with wrong sauce . we asked for extra corn tortillas and never got them . the food was fine but service was mediocre .
mexican	what was advertised as being $ 5.65 came out it $ 8 when i told them no guac just meat and cheese . i save them avocado money only to be charged over $ 2 for cheese ... makes sense right ? they now charge 50 cents to use a credit card even though i spent $ 15 . also get it to go it 's disguising inside .
mexican	unfortunately , there are no real vegan options . even the beans are made with dairy . the rest of the family seemed to enjoy the food , but vegans should come prepared to starve .
mexican	this place is mostly self serve cause kitchen staff did everything from preparing to cashier to serving . i ordered a fish taco to try and i asked for spicy . the fry fish was still soft inside n outside maybe left it there for longer time . normally would fry it again before serving . is not spicy at all and the sauce on the side is like tasteless . next time will try their other rice meal . this taco is only worth 2 stars .
mexican	service was odd , was not told about all the specials . the food was just ok and i " m happy i only paid 1 / 2 price during happy hour . there are better places for happy hour in the area .
mexican	hours said ther open till 00 : 01 ? makes no sense but online said ther . open till 11 : 00pm we arrived at 10 : 34 waited at the voice box for five minutes drove up to the window and was ushered away by the window guy saying they were closed very disappointed in the customer service and the nonchalant gesture that was given to us to go away
mexican	ordered fajitas for 2 and instead of getting sizzling strips of chicken , steak , chorizo , etc. we got flavorless chunks of mystery meat that were indistinguishable from each other . you can get better fajitas at a chili 's and pay less . the service was below par and we always had to chase down the waitress . this place has really declined as it used to be our favorite mexican place and is now , well , just a place .
mexican	foolish me , taco tuesday , party night . found seats at the bar . $ 5 pacificos , not $ 2 as advertised . the dj was in the house and miley cyrus was on and loud . no fish tacos on the menu , will not return .
mexican	i love shwarmas like everyone else , but there were flies pitching on the food and no one seemed to care , the toppings looked dried out and withered , very old looking . i walked out without ordering , i just couldn 't . area is sketchy as f too ( but this doesn 't usually bug me if there 's good food ) sorry i didn 't give it a try ? -no regrets .
mexican	what can i say other then i most likely wouldn 't return . food was bland nothing special . pancake was burned on the bottom , " chilaquiles verdes " were gross not authentic at all . ordered over easy eggs came out cooked through the middle . fake canned refried beans that ' the waitress said " they made fresh " which was bs i come from a mexican family and i know when i taste real frijoles those were def not fresh . anyways service was fine no complaints on that just would not recommend this spot to anyone . it was pretty empty too . we originally were supposed to go to tacos el gordo but it was packed so we just came here .
mexican	hash-a-go-go had a crowd . the margaritas had a bitter taste . strawberry margaritas were too sweet . food was just okay .
mexican	great interior decor , friendly environment , cool looking bar . ordered 5 street tacos that were not hot and at room temperature , they must have been sitting out because they came immediately , like faster than taco bell . also , bacon jalapeño came out soggy and cold , which was sad because i was looking forward to them with goat cheese . water glasses had water stains and then to top it off my girlfriend 's cucumber margaritta didn 't even come full . look at pictures for details . all in all , will not be back .
mexican	the cashier said we 're out of margaritas until monday . unfortunately , she didn 't think it was that big of a deal . i decided to leave , based on her response . rating is not reflective of the food , because i 've eaten at another location and it was good that time . unfortunately , i was just very disappointed with the service at this location .
mexican	service was friendly so no complaints there . not great for gluten free and i think our server wasn 't sure either so i was crossing my fingers and hoping for the best when ordering my chicken nachos . the nachos looked a bit bare . the chicken was pre-packed and cut up so no sauce or seasoning issues . the corn chips were fine . the guacamole was bought in but the salsa was more like a red pepper sauce and it didn 't taste the best . so cafe turquaz didn 't wow me . there are probably good options for others but not for gluten free me ...
mexican	got 2 egg burritos , 2 bean cheese 1 / 2lb burritos and bun taco . the flour torts were dry and hard one cracked while biting into and sauce squirted out all over shirt . the bean burritos were not 1 / 2 lb and hardly any cheese and the bun taco the bun was dry and hard / crumbly and the meat tasted old ! ! ! no reason for this on the food they werent even busy ! ! i will second guess before coming to this location again . this is the second time this has happened and all that is said to us is oh ..
mexican	rather have gone to mcdonalds or bk ..... sorry commissary ... u fail ! ! ! ! !
mexican	was rushed through order and the burritos were not impressive . eggs were hard and tortilla was hard . won 't go back .
mexican	i am pretty sure he found a place that had breakfast that had booze , so that was the deciding factor . it definitely wasn 't the food , which was not very good . chorizo and egg burrito - nothing could save it , not salsa , not sour cream , not ketchup ! would not go back here - maybe the mexi food is better , but i doubt it - its called two eggs cantina and has bad breakfast , no thank you .
mexican	however , it seemed like there was high turnover and we didn 't have to wait long before we were seated . ordered one of their specials of the day : jerk chicken benny as well as the brie , bacon and avocado benny . my salad was drenched in oil / dressing which made it difficult to eat , and i asked for hollandaise on the side , which i 'm glad i did , as the portions were small but extremely filling and heavy . prices are decent for the area and the food was tasty , but i 'm not sure i 'd wait in line again for brunch here . coffee was a bit watered down . cash only !
mexican	in summary : value just not realized . sat outside with heaters and christmas music which was the highlight of the visit . food and drink way over priced . for a place with the name of tqla , i would hope to taste it in the $ 10 margaritas . we will be back for a happy hour .... maybe. never again for dinner . pass .
mexican	completely rude staff and terrible , terrible food . will never go back again .
mexican	ordered the skirt steak nachos & a mojito . i did not care for the nachos but my daughter who wanted them thought they were fine . the mexican cheeses were not good . tasted rotten , even though it wasn 't ! the chips / salsa are quite good . chips are very fresh . tomatillo salsa is very refreshing . the mojito was fine . i prob won 't eat here again .
mexican	happy hour prices are good but food was okay . server seemed annoyed we didn 't want to upgrade our margaritas to full priced margaritas . i agree with the previous reviews about the fruit flies ... there were a lot of fruit flies and makes me question how sanitary the kitchen / bar is . i would maybe come back again for happy hour but i won 't return for regular menu .... there are better options nearby .
mexican	had the carne asada burrito and i was not impressed at all . firts if you are going to classify the meat as " asada " it can 't be boiled . well after this experience i don 't care to try anything else here . don 't know what they hype is about . it 's not that complicated to make decent food . all four people in my lunch group agreed , bad choice . we should have just did sushi .
mexican	was told they don 't have salsa ( what ? ) . waited 15 minutes . then were told they didn 't have the ingredients for one of the burritos . changed the order to a chili relleno burrito , waited for another 15 minutes . got chili relleno but no burrito . and definitely paid for the burrito . have given this place many chances but have never been satisfied and won 't be giving them another chance .
mexican	but that was the only thing i can say was great . chips and salsa were goodish and the tacos we had al pastor was ok but the carnitas were a definite pass . i can 't get over the lack of flavor and the steamed tortillas . reminded me of pollo loco tortilla bags ... ambiance was nice and service was good . also the tortilla soup is a safe bet . it was pretty good better than the rest of the food .
mexican	it 's a pretty restaurant . with the openness and tree lights , etc . food was fine . i liked the presentation of the chips and three types of salsa on a baking sheet . i 'm going to steal that idea . i was happy they served sangria . service was very attentive .
mexican	they had a $ 4.99 special of a chicken enchilada with a side of beans and rice . what a smokin ' deal , right ? unfortunately , the enchilada was horrible . it was tasteless , old and completely falling apart . i picked at it and ended up with about 4 bites . the chips and dip was the only bonus out of the entire meal . i definitely got what i paid for . never again .
mexican	had a horrible time . service was slow and the food was bland and cold . never coming again .
mexican	i ordered the ceviche and what i received was basically chips and watery salsa with a few chunks of shrimp . i may sound like a snob , but i 've enjoyed authentic ceviche in peru and this sorry excuse for seafood salsa is not what ceviche is supposed to be . ceviche is raw fish " cooked " in lemon / lime juice with peppers and onions .
mexican	i would never go back . we felt completely like we were a nuisance to the one waitress working . mind you we were the only ones in the restaurant . it took 15 minutes to get her attention that we were ready to order . the chips ( though free ) were stale and too thick . the burrito ( though large ) was doughy and the fillings were not high quality . very disappointing experience .
mexican	nice area and vibe . the food was ok . a lot of cumin spice on carne asada . i ordered a burrito which came with chips and an agua fresca . $ 13.00 . the agua fresca was very good . the size of the burrito was like a taco . servings are very small compared to the price . my friend ordered 3 tacos and a drink and it was $ 16 and tacos were small as well .
mexican	took 1 hour 15 mins to make 3 tacos . tacos were mediocre and over priced compared to my normal watering holes at chacho 's and playa cabana . won 't be returning . much better options in toronto .
mexican	the tacos themselves were just ok nothng too spectacular . the sides ( rice and beans ) were dry and i didnt care for them all that much . the chips and salsa that get were sadly probably the high point of the meal . for the price , this place is a bit over priced . i had hopes for this restaurant but was disappointed .
mexican	saw the lunch menu n ordered the enchiladas special . the menu advertising the specials clearly shows it comes w sour cream . the cashier and manager argued w me that it was wrong and 2 oz of sour cream is $ 2 more . no , ur sign says its included ! ! ! manager would not honor it or own her mistake . sorry customer service as we all know that if u advertise something , u are to honor it . i 'm gonna go ahead n judge here becuz this place was empty at noon at lunch time . so im assuming food sucks too . carolinas on country club was packed ! ! ! think i 'll go w carolinas next time !
mexican	given the menu and a basket of bread to start with , the waiter showed up after 10mins to take our orders . we had pulpo , patatas bravas , steamed mussels , steak in skewers , stuffed mushrooms , somethng egg layered with potatoes . the taste was disppointing , pulpo was too soft to the bite , it was tasteless. the bravas were burnt , mussels were served in coconut milk that is canned ! ! ! ugh ! ! ! service was so so . not attentive.had to ask for refill 2x . i have truly experienced better.i also noticed that all the tapas were topped with chopped scallions , onions , tomatoes .
mexican	the chips and salsa were good , the drinks are watered down , the food does not taste fresh ( it tastes like re-heated food ) , and customer service is okay . the patio is nice , and the music is appreciated but that 's about it . it terms of pricing , i guess it 's fine considering it 's vegas . bottom line , if you don 't care about the food / drinks / customer service , then this is your place . i 'm not coming back !
mexican	long wait for a server to come get our drink order . ordered the shrimp salad , but the restaurant ran out of shrimp ( i 've been pescatarian 3 years now ) . ordered it without the shrimp . waited 25 minutes for my food . salad looked like it been sloppily thrown together , and the avocado " dressing " was just smashed up avocado . very disappointed , because i have been here multiple times for brunch , and food was delicious .
mexican	i asked for a water cup with my meal and received a major attitude . the store manager was degrading her workers in front of all of the customers . i won 't be coming back here ever again .
mexican	this place is boarded up and closed . hopefully another mexican restaurant will open here .
mexican	the minute we walked in ( the place was empty ) it felt as if the staff was bothered by our presence . since noone came over to seat us we just sat down at the table closest to us . there was a guy sitting behind the register counting money . after 5 minutes or so he got up and brought 2 menus . food was ok , but nothing special . it was another challenge to get the guys ' atttention again to get the check since by now he was focused on the soccer game shown on the tv . i don 't think we 'll be back - why waste time and money on a place with questionable service .
mexican	some from our party had been and said it was good also chose it because it wasn 't too far for my grandma to walk . when we told them we had 11 in our party the hostesses seemed annoyed and said well idk if we can fit that many it will be 30-40 minutes . so we lingered around in the area . we were eventually seated and oh man the music was so loud ! ! way too loud i couldn 't hear my cousin or friend next to me . i got a free birthday shot of sone nasty tequila i wish i hadnt honestly. food wasnt great , service was ok. but with music louder than a club i left with a headache !
mexican	this taco bell doesn 't not sell pizza . some-how due to not being able to use the bathroom , i decide to order some fast food . i order the nachos grande or whatever you call it . boy i haven 't being here in years and i guessed it showed . these nachos only had cheese , sour cream , chicken , and beans . so i had to add extra toppings . yelp 20 mins later- taco bell did it 's job-i am now sitting on the toilet writing this review and boy i am happy that i am to use the restroom .
mexican	i would only come back to this location for hh .
mexican	the paella had very little taste , the octopus pieces were tender but the rest of the seafood was overcooked and chewy . the benedict was overly salty from the serrano ham and not very well balanced . portions are typical for a tapas restaurant , so expect to leave hungry . restaurant atmosphere is nice and very friendly server . but not overly impressed on the quality or taste of the food though ... much better choices downtown .
mexican	we had the chicken kabob which came with salad and rice . i would just recommend waiting in line for tacos at tacos el gordo .
mexican	it was my first time and there was a hair in one of my tacos , i couldn 't eat it . i was so disgusted .
mexican	came here for taco tues. that one of the reviewers wrote about. well they don 't do taco tues. so try somewhere else.very disappointing .
mexican	the margaritas are amazing but the guac was the type your 8 your old nephew would make . it 's just so off from what it should be but you feel obliged to eat it and tell them it 's alright . only the creamed corn fish was worth it , all other plates just were not worth the money .
mexican	i came today again to eat here and toke my friend with me-total disaster ! ! ! ! chicken was dry like hell i had to spit it out of my mouth 2 times for each taco ( i order 3 of them ) .the steak was very chewy ! ! that 's all i done with this place !
mexican	i order a combo fish taco and fries . i didn 't get the fish taco or the fries . got something else and no fries . took them close to 30 minutes to give me the wrong order . not coming here angain . if i could give no stars i would . now i 'm just hungry after that little bit of food i got . not worth it .
mexican	will never go back . long lines , huge wait , miserable employees and i swear it was 100 degrees in there . the place was absolutely filthy . tables were not wiped down , garbage overflowing , windows were gross . the food was just " okay , " for the money i expected better . rice was under cooked .
mexican	i ordered ceviche and everyone 's plate came out except mine . waited and waited finally cancelled my order . won 't be back to this place ! ! ! ! !
mexican	" $ 5 per person to get in . $ 5 for 2 street tacos which went very good . $ 6 for a generic mix margarita . way too loud raggae music . won 't be coming back .
mexican	it was decent at most , they were pretty much like the tacos you can get at taco bell . service was kind of slow here . we only wanted the tacos to go but there wasn 't anyone to take our order for a good 15 minutes until the guy at the adjacent bar came to the rescue . the tacos are not filling especially if you are partying and drinking after . trust me in half an hour or an hour you will be hungry again .
mexican	i got the chicken quesadilla and the chicken was burnt . i ordered a side of rice it was $ 2 and got about 2 bites . it was way over priced . flavor was very blan .
mexican	first , we were the only people in the restaurant and it took about 3 minutes of us standing around for anybody to realize we were even there . we had a pastor taco ..... which was very good ..... but we also got 2 combo plates and neither of them were very good . everything was just luke-warm and bland . really nothing special or good . too bad ....
mexican	got the food and was excited . my kids cheese enchiladas were ice cold . my husbands burrito was way to greasy and had nothing going for him . the nachos were a joke . chips with melted cheese . that 's it . no tomatoes no nothing . the only thing that was decent was the big cheese crisp that was still dry yet pretty good and if you were to get it then i recommend guacamole because it was very dry . very disappointed .
mexican	sat on roof top patio which seemed like a cool place to have some drinks and eat on a sunday afternoon . took over 30 minutes just for a waitress to take our drink orders ! i was getting " hangry " by that point too so it was hard not to get annoyed . ordered some standard guacamole and some chips to start , with a flight of tequila . had steak fajitas as a main course . didn 't finish till 3.5 hours later .. food was very slow . nothing memorable and it certainly wasn 't because of the tequila . that wore off the first hour .. will i go back ? maybe ...
mexican	" however all the lights were off and a young man was parked at the open drive through window with his window down as well . i stayed there for ten minutes hoping the young lady would be polite enough to stay open for the hours posted but she did not .
mexican	we all ordered margaritas and wow were they awesome ! ! ! we ordered several tacos which were just ok . i got a burrito bowl which was really good ... we will prob come back but just for the drinks .
mexican	there was no line and now i know why . the food was awful , the portions were small , and the employees were talking about the customers in spanish ( i know because i 'm fluent ) ! i 'd give this place negative stars if i could . needless to say , i will not be back .
mexican	it was nothing but utter disappointment ; tried to give it a shot again and this place has gone to the dogs . we left after an hour with no meal served , 2 flat drinks , horrendous service , no decency of filling up the complimentary chips since we were waiting . saw two similar poorly served customers leaving as well . to top it all the place was not even half full . this lonestar location sucks , please avoid it like the plague .
mexican	their menu is long ! be warned they cook everything in lard so not vegetarian friendly . even the chips . my friend couldn 't eat anything so we had to leave .
mexican	both of us left behind 2 full plates of food because it was so gross . i was most surprised that the waiter didn 't ask why he was throwing away so much food . he had the queue to say " is everything okay ? " but he didn 't ( which is poor service , if you ask me ) . i let her choose the restaurant but i knew 100 % it would be gross because barrio café is also no bueno . overrated . at least the restaurants are consistent . i hate nothing more than wasting food and money . the relationship didn 't work out and neither did this restaurant . i would choose taco bell before this place any day .
mexican	this is not even close to traditional mexican food . the food is like it came out of a freezer and microwaved . i could of done it myself at home for cheaper . it 's a really shady place , and looks dirty . menu is not worth the time reading , the portions are smaller then my iphone . i would not bring kids , yourself , or a bad date your trying to ditch . it 's not a place you wanna go eat , avoid it at all costs and spend your money somewhere else .
mexican	was looking forward to trying out the food so brought the whole family for sunday lunch . bottom line , no one will be going back a second time . the chicken and the steak tacos ( corn tacos which are homemade ) were so soggy they fell apart on the first bite . the carne asada was burnt and the beans were filled with loads of fatty pork . chips and salsa were average but you are charged $ 3 . i hope they are still tweaking the menu and will change the " family style " serving style . the portions are definitely not big enough to share and people get confused on who 's food belongs to who .
mexican	service was good and staff friendly . had the corn for starters then a number of different tacos for main . i have to say i was really surprised at how bland the food was . there was very little flavour . also both my partner and i ordered corn for starters which turned into 4 pieces , i would have appreciated if they had told me it was 2 pieces per person .
mexican	had bacon wrapped shrimp. good flavors , but the shrimp was over done . typical beans and rice . nothing special . the food did come to the table hot . nothing really stands out about this place .
mexican	gave me the wrong order of enchiladas which were basically wet tacos . customer service was terrible and everything i ordered was half-assed . flautas de pollo and tacos de asada were dry and flavorless . stick to the 16th location and avoid this one . food is unsatisfactory .
mexican	over priced , took a while , questionable on how authentic it really is . the " queso dip " had just about every ingredient except queso , and it was one of the primary reasons we wanted to check this place out , but 0 / 6 people enjoyed it . the tacos were mini tacos at full price with 3 ingredients . don 't get the rave about this place what 's so ever ! limited parking , quaint restaurant . didn 't try any , but wide selection of tequila .
mexican	the restaurant wasn 't busy , but getting our food took a long time , the service was okay . food was okay tasting nothing great . would definitely check out somewhere else for a good mexican meal .
mexican	came here on a saturday around 5 pm , place is clean , wasn 't too packed , i ordered a taco plate and it looked like a giant salad , tacos were all lettuce , chicken had no taste , tasted bland .... wake up guys for 15.95 your selling a mexican chicken salad .. not impressed
mexican	however , that is no excuse to have your food arrive over an hour after you order it . the food is mediocre at best and is a sad excuse for mexican food . arizona is a great place for mexican food and the spotted donkey definitely missed that mark . the only thing good about this place are the mints which you can grab freely at the hostess counter . i grabbed about 20 mints to be able to feel better about spending my money at this place . i 'm hoping that i won 't be spending my night shitting my brains out . wish me luck !
mexican	i ordered a chicken burrito without lettuce and extra pico di gallo in the burrito . it took like 5-7 minutes for my burrito to come out . and when i got it the tortilla was dry and semi hard , there was no extra pico di gallo in the burrito . the chicken was very dry . the only thing good here was the salsa that they give you , i had to use that to give flavor to the burrito . and it was kinda small . i 'd skip this place and head to the pizza shop or sandwich place .
mexican	it was dead empty which was a plus . set up was weird since there were different lines for different types of meats . didn 't mind that at all what i did i mind was the prices . holy cow ! 2.25 for a taco ? what a rip , there so much cheaper back at home and the meat is better seasoned . the only plus was the tortillas . they looked home made and we 're delicious . wouldn 't recommend though .
mexican	we sat on the outdoor patio and the waiter only poked his head out every now and then . i got the mexican benedict and the portions were very big . first bite was great but it quickly became apparent that it wasn 't fresh breakfast potatoes and when the benny cooled , it was unpleasant to eat . don 't think i would ever return .
mexican	placing an order and waiting is kinda hectic , people are on your back , no breathing space . tacos are pretty tiny ! ! messed up on my order but they gladly fixed it . was satisfied with the tacos de cabeza. might give this place another try , might not .
mexican	chips and salsa were just okay . several , small containers of various salsas provided . me ? i prefer a nice sized bowl of a medium-spiced , homemade salsa . chips were good . beer ? the dosequis lager was flat . ambience ? not the best place for watching tv unless ur sitting right at the bar . also , they were piping country music over the speakers at a hearty volume--which was bad enough , until one patron shared his musical " talents " with us . why me ? service ? friendly and efficient , but could not save the day . probably won 't be back . cheers ! rs
mexican	it wasn 't that busy and service still wasn 't great . their salsa is ok but a little bland . i got their lunch tacos with rice . i asked for soft tacos instead of hard shell and still got hard shell . no one even came to the table to check on us after we got our food . i got ground beef with my tacos and the meat was very greasy . it was so greasy , the juices soaked the hard shell by the time it got to the table . that was the exact reason why i wanted soft tacos . their food is mediocre and so is their service .
mexican	all the food is bland , the bar is okay though. if you want to drink and eat nachos go here , if you 're looking to dine , don 't even bother .
mexican	2nd time i came , still out of corn . service is slow , but at least the food was fresh and made to order . would prefer tacos el gordo .
mexican	came here one afternoon with my mom and sister it wasn 't what i expected at all food was horrible service from the manger was horrible as well my mom had to take her food back 3 times
mexican	i waited in the drive thru for no less than 20 minutes . the last five minutes of waiting took place after i had finally paid . too slow ! ! ! you would think in all that time i would get my meal the way i asked , without lettuce . but they actually went and put extra lettuce . so rediculous . never had problems at this fili b 's before until today . not going back .
mexican	one of the employees had to make an asshole comment complaining about us ordering too much food and being a fatass .. i 'm sorry but look at your pathetic self ? working at taco bell + having a horrible attitude ... i was just trying to get a quick snack for the fam .
mexican	asked for one taco which was cheaper as i wasn 't very hungry and my boyfriend ordered two tacos . we both got two tacos . boyfriend ordered a lemonade which the waitress forgot about . when he asked for the second time , it came . paid the bill but did not tip as well since she messed up the order and didn 't bring the drink right away . on the 16th i checked my bank account and found that the waitress tipped herself an extra $ 2.00 . not happy . normally the food and service are okay , but taking my money is not okay .
mexican	once every thing was out we all agreed the food was very bland and was lacking seasoning . for $ 20 roughly per plate the food was very average and informed the hotel that of this experience .
mexican	i had the carnitas burrito which wasn 't that good it needed more flavor , the cheese out did the taste of the meat . also some of the fountain drinks were out of service .
mexican	i ended up sending the gorditas back as they were not at all flavorful or good ! this place is a disappoint and not worth your time / palette !
mexican	not that it 's a huge deal but all i ordered was the 3 beef rolled tacos with no cheese and guacamole . the rollers were totally overdone and the guacamole is more of a dressing and doesn 't seem like avocado at all . not at all the quality of other locations . and all of the employees singing loud and chattering back and forth felt pretty rude .
mexican	came here around 1 : 30pm on sat and was crowded . took about 10 mins for the churros ( guess they were focus on making sandwiches more ) . it was freshlt made , tasted good but i had better . quite expensive for the few pieces .
mexican	they had friends hanging out at the drive thru socializing but when we walked up and asked why they were closed they all started speaking in spanish then shook their heads and said ' closed ' . we asked if it was because they were out of food and they didn 't respond . we walked all the way there for nothing . will not return .
mexican	right off the bat , our bartender was really cool and made us felt very welcome as we were walking in . we sat a the table in the lounge since the restaurant itself was close off . ordered a couple items off the tapas portion since they were half off due to happy hour . nothing really stood out , but the duck tacos . it was the only item i had to look up on the menu to see what i was eating , but it 's still not enough to have me coming back . this is a harsh review , but i guess i am taking it out on sammys since h & r was closed . sorry guys .
mexican	ordered a tostada and it was soggy by the time it got to my table . for this kind of food it 's nothing i can 't make at home .
mexican	it 's near our restaurant so and my mom had been through the drive through a couple times . not to sure how i feel about this place . we sat inside for their lunch special . i had chicken tacos and corn . i notice that they don 't serve seafood . i 'm happy that they have chicken option since i don 't eat meat . crunchy taco was decent . i opted for all rice no beans . i 'm not a fan here but my mom is .
mexican	food was ok , nothing spectacular , at least the tortilla chips and green sauce were the highlights as it was different mexican food than what i am normally used to. it was unique that the beans were black beans and that the rice seemed more like spanish rice even though the waitress stated that toros is mexican now . this must be a good place to watch sports games as they had football jersey 's all over .
mexican	ordered 3 tacos , chicken with cheese only , came with black beans n rice . beans n rice were very hot and had typical flavor . chicken tacos came with green sauce i did not order . chicken was warm at best and could not even melt the cheese as i ate the first one . tacos came with very little meat ..... out of the 3 maybe had enough meat for one taco . food was brought out to my table , well after it was miss delivered to someone else ! won 't be returning as i learned why i stopped coming !
mexican	it was my first time here and i have to say i was disappointed . i ordered the enchiladas with steak and they had no flavor . the enchilada sauce tasted like it came out of a can . my boyfriend got the ranchero burrito and he said it was ok . the only good thing was that we had a good waitress , but that isn 't enough to have me come back . i would suggest that you skip this restaurant .
mexican	the food was great as always as always . unfortunately we didn 't get the awesome serve we are is to . the waiter was just too inattentive drinks took to long each time as we wanted and watched them sitting at the well for 10 min .
mexican	however , the doors were locked and the open sign was not on . there was a lady in the lobby who saw me but didn 't come over to clarify store hours . waste of my time being that i drove from maricopa to try this spot . not coming here again .
mexican	came here to have a few hard shell tacos and a cold drink today .... not to be hustled for some more money by this restaurant .
mexican	first they didn 't have what i wanted . then i ordered an egg and ham burrito so i can just eat the inside because i 'm on a special diet . what i got was mostly potatoes with an over cooked egg , and ham . needless to say that most of the food went to waste because i can 't eat potatoes . i would have taken it back and asked for them to remake it but it took so long to get our food that i would be late for church if i waited .
mexican	the mixed up our drink order , but we still enjoyed the margaritas . i ordered the fish burrito , which came enchilada style and was pretty good but a little pricey . the wait staff seemed nervous and unsure of what they were doing . however the decor is nice , open and there 's patio dining available . will have to return to give better review .
mexican	as i went into the bathroom to wash my hands , i was startled by a dead cockroach lying on the floor . not to mention , the food was terrible . i ordered pupusas , thinking " how could they screw this up ? " well they did , there was absolutely no flavor and the traditional sauce was extremely watered down . moreover , the flies constantly buzzing around and landing on my food didn 't make it any more appetizing ... i would not recommend this place to anyone .
mexican	the patio was pretty awesome . however we came to eat and they told us they ran out of food because they didn 't realize how busy they would be . i thought she was joking . it probably would have been nice if someone told us this when we got there instead of waiting around . epic fail
mexican	when i change my order i don 't expect you to tell me i 'm wrong that you told me already how it is . you just accept it and make the customer happy .
mexican	sat for 45 minutes eating chips , waitresses walked by helping all the tables around us , never acknowled us . so we got up to leave ... all the waiteeses said " have a great night , see you next time . " never even got a cocktail or anything !
mexican	chose the shrimp avocado layered salad and was disappointed to only find one small piece of avocado inside the salad . the salad was not the best but the dressing was really good . also , i got two crunchy tacos and when i opened the foil one of the tacos didn 't even look like a taco . the shell of the taco was half soft and some of the chicken was tough to eat .
mexican	the area in which the restaurant is located is currently under construction which makes things a little unpleasant in 100 + degree weather . the service was extremely slow although the place was far from busy . the food was mediocre which was surprising for a mexican restaurant in pheonix , arizona where southwestern food is quite popular . i got chicken fajitas . the presentation was nice , but food tasted just ok . chips and dip were blah- chips were cold and not very appealing . sour cream is extra ? not impressed . would only recommend if you want some average mexican food .
mexican	the food was ok , enjoyed the yam burrito , and portion size was good . we both mentioned that we wished we had waited for the meal we really wanted instead !
mexican	the server also got my order wrong , as there was a big language barrier . overall , had much better pupusas and service at other local salvadorian restaurants , so i would not recommend this place or return .
mexican	ordered a bowl . the first thing that shocked me was the price . how can i get lower quality food , less food , but for a higher price than chipotle ? i was dissatisfied with the experience . no wonder they were empty .
mexican	i would say walk your drunken self else where if i were you . for the price of everything , the portion size was really small and the flavor was lackluster . the whole table felt the same way . 2 people from out table even returned their margaritas because they didnt taste right . the server was nice , but that doesnt really make up for everythign else .
mexican	this was our second stop of many planned on our adventure . i ordered the bulldog margarita expecting something amazing ........ and was disappointed . the only thing i tasted was beer and margarita mix . there was either a very small amount or no tequila in this drink . this is a very popular drink ; i could see it on almost every table that afternoon . i am not sure if i will be back , not a fan of watered down or virgin adult beverages .
mexican	we were provided complimentary chips and a trio of salsas , and drinks came out quickly . unfortunately , our server was a total debbie downer whose initially peppy attitude did a 180 as soon as she found out we didn 't intend to order a full meal . our waters stayed empty , a bill was slapped on our table , and she repeatedly walked by and said " thanks for coming " as if to shoo us out early . considering we each bought $ 10 + margaritas ( the mango-jalapeno is tasty ! ) and tipped well , her attitude was totally unwarranted .
mexican	i told him i 'd be back at my table since he was having trouble with the register . i never saw my card until it was time to pay , and when i asked him where my card was he said he didn 't know and had to look for it . i made sure to check for any fraudulent transactions just in case .
mexican	slowest meal i 've ever had ! the atmosphere and decoration was good . however i 've been in meals with much larger groups and got served way faster . the food was ok . do not recommend large groups to come here .
mexican	had a large group and service was pretty good . coming from southern california , where one can get * amazing * mexican food , this place was meh , average . the margaritas were at least strong . we sat " outside " which was next to the obnoxious pool and club music . better places to eat , won 't be coming back .
mexican	nope . tacos are tiny with super thick tortillas to stuff your stomach with the cheapest ingredient and then charge you ridiculous prices for it . funny t-shirts , but save your money and tummy room . your best bet is an off beat taco place like the one in o ' sheas casino . but you wont listen . you will go and eat the food and say , " yea , that review was right . " and now you have 80-100 bucks less in your pocket . over $ 65 for two by the way . im not cheap , i just want at least a little quality for that price .
mexican	the only reason i 'm giving 2 stars is because they accommodated my daughter 's special request for a breakfast burrito . they gave my wife water when she ordered lemonade . the meat was skimpy , the nachos had melted processed cheese on them . it was a big disappointment .
mexican	let me say , i strongly regret this decision . their water machine was " out " so i ordered a sprite to drink , which was flat and tasted like straight up syrup . the food was alright , but i wouldn 't come back , and the flies wouldn 't leave us alone . on top of that , the waitress was rude and had a very negative attitude . not a good experience . spend the extra few dollars and go to maize .
mexican	) it was dead . they had live music which was pretty good but kind of loud . our waitress was attentive and nice . however ... i got the regular salty margarita and it was probably the worst marg i 've ever had . it was so sweet i was literally struggling to finish it . i love margaritas usually , but this was just bad bad bad . nothing on the menu looked that great so we just stuck with chips and salsa ( average salsa ) . probably won 't be returning . you can get a better margarita down the street at loco patron or z tejas .
mexican	extremely loud music . i didn 't like that when my drink order was taken they bought out a can of diet coke , when there was visibly a soda machine with free refills . so had to send the can back . also the food was overpriced for your typical dominican restaurant . the food was ok in taste . wouldn 't really go back to this place rather go to saona or abuelitas and they are very close by for better food and ambience .
mexican	the food was decent not the best i 've had a day later my husband and i had food poisoning we had the same thing we shared a botana mixta will not be coming here again ! ! !
mexican	i don 't know if they were too lazy to make a fresh batch. where 's the customer service at ? luckily i love their food , but i dont feel like dining in here ever .
mexican	wish more waiters were like him .... the restaurant also has a sizable bar and outdoor seating available . located in a shopping plaza with plenty of parking . cons : food was ok . i ordered the chimichanga and wife got the burrito rice bowl along with spinach queso dip . the salsa for the chip was far below average , almost like a thickened ketchup . i wish i had more positive things to say about the food . disappointed with the food and cannot recommend as a place to go .
mexican	pros : the fried jalapeno shooters were excellent . highly recommended . cons : i killed a scorpion that was on the wall right behind my head . smashed it with my napkin . the waitress gave us a free desert because of it after i showed her the dead fella , but the service was sub-par the entire meal at best . lots of waiting and we had to request little things like silverware multiple times . outside of the shooters , the meals were not impressive either .
mexican	i don 't have any problem spending 20-30 for a dish but this place is way overpriced . portions are very small and frankly the food was not flavorful ; most of it was drenched in sauces and spices to cover up the poorly cooked meat . the best part was finishing my kids cheese burgers , they were way better than our meals . guacamole was $ 11 and it was plain . won 't be back .
mexican	no so much now . food had no flavor the salsa even was sad . i won 't be back .
mexican	they barely greet you when you walk in and don 't thank you when you leave . i think i 'll just drive the 23mins to the other location on russell because they are really friendly there .
mexican	they saw and heard i wasn 't happy with my soup as i dosnt want the guacamole or pico in it and instead of offering me a new bowl just charged me and didn 't care . i had to reach around the counter and get a cup to get he pico out as i hate tomatoes . they did not care one tiny bit . i usually enjoy this place for quick tasty mexican . 100 % disappointed .
mexican	in hindsight , after 20 minutes i should of cancelled the order and left . wasn 't offered any water or chips while waiting so i missed all the hospitality everyone else received in these reviews . when the order arrived , i received a smile and a sorry . i have a soft spot to for family owned businesses , but i can 't bring myself to go back after this . in summary : didn 't enjoy my experience the food did not make up for it
mexican	i thought it was supposed to be cheap street food . i could go to a good restaurant for what i paid for 3 street tacos . a street taco should cost no more than $ 2 , maybe $ 2.50 not $ 4 each . overpriced and over rated .
mexican	but then neither did we . one time could be a mistake . twice in a row tells me something systemically is wrong . won 't be back .
mexican	watched my order sit in the back waiting to be bagged as this bitch handed out everybody else 's order ( including multiple people that came after me ) i asked if that was my order and the cashier gave me a shitty attitude and said yes but they hand them out in the order they 're received . i asked how come she just gave other customers that came after us their food in that case . she just said " that 's how we do it " never going back .
mexican	decorated very festive . chips were better than the salsa which was pretty runny . the guacamole was bland . my husband and i both ordered burritos . they were just ok . nothing too spectacular and mine wasn 't that hot . i did like their rice which was probably the best thing i had there . server was friendly but seemed kinda lost and forgetful which was weird since we were like only the third table there . probably won 't be back to try again for you don 't really get your moneys worth .
mexican	4 min later a waitress comes by and asks what she can get me so i say a menu . duh . i ordered an horchata and the hawaiian chicken skillet . my plate was not hot . the skillet was no sizzling . the tortillas were lukewarm . the chicken had no flavor at all . the beans and rice were okay but lacked in flavor as well . the pineapple in the skillet is canned which surprised me because i have a hard time understanding why a chef would chose such cheep ingredients . this is not real authentic mexican food so be warned . it 's safe to say i won 't be coming here anymore .
mexican	i live in la and am used to expecting that there , but this place was half dead . they had
mexican	when we finally got our drinks , they were very weak and watered down from the start . save yourself the time and hassle and find another restaurant to go to .
mexican	been to other chipotles many times and one of the cool things is how smooth they run no matter how busy . not sure if it was a shift change and they just didn 't have their groove yet . just not a good experience . plus the rice was under cooked . i 'll be going to the one on elliot and the 101 from now on
mexican	i 've never paid an entry fee here so i asked what time they started charging and a few other questions to see if i 'm dealing with a hustler . upon realizing this was the case , our group proceeded to go next door and the guy stopped us and said he was just messing with us .
mexican	ordered ceviche thinking it had to be good . the food was terrible . the whole thing was sitting in lemon soup . it was so sour i cousnt eat more than a bite . worst experience ever . will never go back
mexican	its 12 : 47 and we have not received our food . we walked out . im not paying for my order and never coming back . sucks because the food is great !
mexican	drove through the drive through first to even see if they were open . they were ! i went inside and they said i was drunk and to get out , refused me service and were very rude . i had not been drinking , i am 19 years of age and was heading to work at target with my uniform on . the manager with the tattoos on her arms said she would call the police if i ever came back because i was " crazy stupid for going through a drive through and deciding to come inside . " i hope this place falls through just because of this incident . i called corp and let them know .
mexican	moderately busy . 4 people working . one kid was working very hard and super polite . one lady was working steadily , but not friendly . they were on the line . one girl at the cash register was doing nothing else while the other two ran circles around her . would stand there doing nothing for minutes at a time with ten people in line . fourth guy was in the back on his phone . out of guacamole . literally all five salsa bowls were empty . one employee walked up , played with the scoops , scowled and walked away . half an hour later ? still empty . several soda options non-functional . garbage overflowing . no tray to eat in .
mexican	the hostess , who was leaning over her stand slurping on a drink informed us that they were closed . the sign outsides reads 9 pm as the closing time . she didn 't even have the courtesy to fully stand up to greet us.how rude and sloppy of a presentation . the place must make a killing if they can close 45 minutes early on a saturday . i understand seating the last table at 8 : 45 but 8 : 15 ? why not close at 8 then . horrible customer service and at that point i would rather throw my money at a chain fast food place then try to support a small business .
mexican	the man behind the counter yelled at us telling us they were closed . out of everything . and was just rude about the situation . i work for tips . and he was rude .
mexican	i couldn 't believe what was all the hype about . not juicy . teaspoon of guacamole too plain . the hassle for $ 2.50 tacos . the taco trucks in la are better . maybe they 're known for adobada tacos . we assume all tacos were good . left unsatisfied .
mexican	my wife left half of her dish along with some tapas from later , but unfortunately we forgot the to go box on the table and walked out . i came back within 30-45 seconds to grab it and was told if had already been thrown away . they apologized but did not offer a solution . i appreciate the fast service , but some common sense is obviously missing here ...
mexican	ordered the " arizona burrito " and some fries . fries came out cold and there was some type of hard plastic in my 1st bite . promptly informed waitress and instead of apologizing or explaining she grabbed the plastic , disappeared and showed up again with a " new " burrito . i told her i wasn 't interested and she stated that these things happen and basically what 's the big deal ? ? ? ! ! ! are you kidding me ? ? ? ! ! ! ! never coming again ! !
mexican	came in for a simple shrimp cocktail and a ceviche , the cocktail was pricey for the size and the amount of seafood in it , also not much flavor to it , same thing with the ceviche casuelita at 15 dollars i really spected beter , no seasoning or flavor on the ceviche whatsoever , i could do much better without even trying.total waste of money and time probably would not come back
mexican	cheese dip is watery , chicken on all dishes was flavorless , and orders came out wrong .
mexican	i am surprised at all the good reviews . my cheese enchiladas were served lukewarm , and the cheese on the inside was still cold and not melted . to make it worse , the enchilada sauce was bland . the black beans were bland . no reason to come back .
mexican	the chicken fajita salad was as bland as it could possibly be . literally just chicken , lettuce , and a choice of dressing . no peppers , nothing to make it " fajita . " just bland chicken
mexican	gluten-free ! " without even looking at it . i was starving and had paid , so i did eat it . and was instantly sick as a result . when people ask if something is gluten-free , it isn 't to be a pain it the butt , it 's because we don 't want to end up paying to be sick all day .
mexican	ordered chick fajitas for two ( looked like service for one ) chicken was tough and rubbery . filet nachos had tiny pieces of who knows what they are calling filet .. i would try this place for happy hour , but definitely not worth the money otherwise . good selection of tequila though
mexican	both the rice and beans were pretty gross nothing like i 've ever experienced at a mexican place : ( the beans left this gross after taste in my mouth and the rice just was blah ! the service was weird they sat us right away and got us drinks right away , but when it came to taking our order they were no where to be found ! all in all it was ok nothing special ...
mexican	my recommendation do not come in for vegetarian tacos . if you are omnivorous the . carne asada tacos are fantastic.so this time for lunch with mom very disappointed on the vegetarian side for tacos .
mexican	don 't understand how this happens doesn 't even take this long to get food at a full on mexican restaurant that is packed full . pretty rediculous if you ask me . should have gone to subway next door
mexican	i ordered the tamarind margarita it was " ok " table side guac was good but for the price it 's a very small portion . the chips n salsa was weak i 've had much better tasting salsa . it 's pretty bland & watered down for my taste . wong be back . oh & the server forgot to discount our margaritas after introducing margarita monday to us but we told her & she adjusted it . first & last !
mexican	salsa very tasty . not spicy good for gringos . personally i like spicy but good flavor . my waiter checked on me onces and has not been back sense . my drink and salsa has bye dry for over 35min . i was going to order food but know i 'm just upset at the poor service on just want to leave . okeay drinks good salsa horrible service i said i would give this place a 2nd try and you have let me down both times . will not be back .
mexican	completely disappointed . came hungry and left hungry after a $ 16 lunch . three meatballs that were mushy , tomatoes soup cup was tiny and spicy and olives and one piece of toast . hubby got a shrimp tapas with three shrimp and two slivers of pineapple for $ 13 . i would have looked past the prices maybe if the food was amazing . but the service was very poor . why do people work in a bar but act as if they don 't like people ? very short attitude and unfriendly . when i asked a question it was as if i was bothering her . not coming back . save your money .
mexican	two customers in front of me were upset at the service . i understand why . these ladies were on their phone , making fun of their customer 's with complaints in clear sight- i had ordered two spicy chicken and they gave me plain . i came up to tell them and they were on their cellphones . lol management where art thou ? unprofessionalism to it 's finest , talking ish in spanish .
mexican	i made it a point to come here to try the 99 ¢ fish tacos and they were gross . the " fish " were these breaded but flavorless overcooked sticks wrapped in stale tortillas . even the salsas here were bland . i may come back to try the asada but it 'll probably be a long while . but i gave them an extra star for having jarritos & mexican bottled coke .
mexican	yelp has pretty average reviews and it was close to work . i got greeted very fast and sat decided to sit at the bar . right away i noticed it was very dark and 70s music playing not quit what i was expecting from a mexican restaurant . got the rolled tacos and within minutes got my food . pretty fast which makes me think the food was sitting there , but i could be wrong . overall was descent : tacos were good , beans ok , and rice was very dry . my waitress kept sitting down by the bar and had to ask another waitress for extra food .
mexican	it was empty . i also asked about the 24 hour service , and the guy says no one comes by after 10pm so they close . half the stuff we asked for wasn 't even available . all the tables were dirty so we took the order to go instead . when we opened the bag at home , the order was incomplete ! frustrating . that 's what i get for trusting the cashier who doesn 't even speak english to get it right. grrrrr .. the young kids at mcdonalds give better service than this place . not coming back here again . i 'll spend my money somewhere else .
mexican	35 minutes later , no meal .... and it was simple : taco 's ! anyhow , once we got out food it was ok . not sure if this place just opened , but the staff seemed a bit confused .
mexican	nothing was fresh . food was put on a platter and put in the oven to warm up . the plate was hot but that 's about it . the rice got over cooked and tacos were luke warm . disappointing because the other jalapeno 's up the road is really good .
mexican	my order of the shredded beef burrito felt rushed . the man at the counter asked me what kind of meat i wanted and if i wanted cheese then automatically threw my order in the toaster . what if i didn 't want my burrito toasted dude ? i wanted to add pico and lettuce in my burrito which i had to get on the side but since the burrito was already assembled it was hard to include my now side items into my already assembled burrito . kind of disappointed since they 'd like to replace their competitor but are not able to provide a consistent customer experience .
mexican	got seated and ordered my food . i ordered the enchiladas and asked for it to have little cheese on top because they always pack it with way too much . when my food arrived it was still overly loaded . not happy with the service . seemed that the waiters need to slow down and write the orders down and the cooks need to slow down because theyre slopping .
mexican	i ordered a small menudo which i ate in 4 mintues because of how small it was . that was prbly the best part . i also ordered a green chilli chicken burrito that i couldn 't finish because it just didnt taste good . my waitress did her job , but only took our order and came to check on us once .. after we had finished our meal . i probably won 't be coming back .
mexican	the bar tender was horrible ! ! took awhile to get drinks and asked for extra salsa with our chips , it 's been 30 min and still waiting for that extra salsa . took awhile to order a second drink and i seriously wish i just got up and left before doing so . two thumbs down
mexican	the place wasn 't busy at all and the girl making the food had the biggest problem with serving us . every time we asked for something she rolled her eyes and just generally looked annoyed to be serving us . but the girl who took our order was very pleasant . probably won 't be going back to this location again .
mexican	there was one customer i finally found sitting outside but no staff anywhere ! i sat there for ten minutes waiting for someone to come over and no one ever did . how to you expect to get business if you 're not even going to be around to serve your customers ? i had never even been there before and now i won 't be coming back
mexican	tuesday for lunch . let 's hope dinners later in the week are better . it 's too bad . no martini glasses so it came in a champagne flute . took way too long to get our drinks . let me say that again , way too long . we had six tacos between the two of us . mine were tasteless . chicken , beef , steak . the other three were blah . fried fish was terrible . shrimp was ok and grilled fish was ok . tres leches was awful . service blah . no need to return . many better places to go . no wonder they have so many daily specials .
mexican	came in they ran out of tacos the pastor and carnitas only available meat was asada if you want basic tacos come here or else find somewhere else to go .
mexican	they never have it consistently even though it 's on the menu for saturdays . salsas are good and the burritos are okay , but the menudo on the menu for saturday isn 't really available . changed to 1 star when my wife started to clean her dirty cutlery .
mexican	won 't be going to this low class on the border again . great service in different states though . you can observe the desperation with low qualifications to hire certain people .
mexican	food was ok , service was ok . then this girl came up to the table i think her name was rachel and made us feel very welcome and knew what she was doing . made my wife and i night ! we will be coming back to see her .
mexican	the cashier was counting down her drawer and barely looked up at us . the cook or manager ( not really sure ) came up and bagged our order and gave us the wrong change back . he corrected himself when i said something but then we got home and the food was also inccorect . not a good experience from start to finish and have had bad experience at this location before . will not go back .
mexican	was refused service when asked to show documention for her being a service dog ! will not be coming back to contribute money to this place of business that refused me service due to showing documents ! you should teach your employees the laws of what they can and can 't ask for . called to speak to the manager after of which she said the health dept . told employees to ask to see documents of the service dog . of which seems ridiculous , i 'm sure the health dept . knows what you can and can 't ask for and the laws surrounding a service animal .
mexican	but service was extremely horrible , no flavor at all ! my four friends and i never even got our soups ! the chips were okay . food tasted old and was not good at all . never coming to this place again . authentic food ? not even close .
mexican	ate hear because we love , love mexican , however they charge for chips and salsa after 2 baskets , they don 't put cheese dip / sauce on anything without an upcharge . even normal dishes that should have it . because let 's be honest that is the best part about mexican food . the chimichangas and rice where dry . it was also really expensive for mexican . $ 15- $ 20 a plate . not ideal for the mexican food i was served . i 'm not bashing , just trying to help out fellow yelpers .
mexican	unfortunately after waiting for about twenty minutes , we had the bowl of chips finished off and drinks almost empty , no one had been by to take our food order . they weren 't that busy . we decided not to order after waiting a few minutes longer our waiter finally came by to take our order , i told him just charge us for the drinks and chips so we could go somewhere else . we weren 't charged .
mexican	for 5 carnitas tacos ! and it was not busy at all . i watched people who came in after me get their orders . my blood was boiling by the time i left . thank god i got them to go ! as for the tacos , they were ok--a little greasy . i liked the green sauce--not too spicy . however something about this location just brings in the crazies too . customers including myself were being harrased by someone who came in off the street . management did nothing so i guess its common . overall 2 stars- mainly for the food . the atmospre is terrible . maybe i will visit a different location because the food wasn 't bad .
mexican	if you look at the menu , the photo shows the thing full of beef . it had like no beef in it . what a rip off for 3.69 . a soft taco for a dollar would be more filling . i 'm done with taco bell ! it 's a scam
mexican	we ordered margaritas and entrees . first off , the margaritas were warm . secondly , the food was sub-par . the nachos we could have made at home , the tacos came out cold and the rest of the food was only okay . the worst part of all is that the total came to $ 225 . nothing memorable about this place . there is a reason it only has two stars . please listen to all the other bad reviews . they know what they 're taking about .
mexican	large potions however , if you are trying to fatten up . had the jalapeno poppers and shrimp tacos to go . they give you bland chips and salsa too , because mexico .
mexican	recieved a bottomless chips and salsa . with a rubber band in it . yummy . not really . it was really . pretty nasty . its a shame . because i love this place . but didnt like the treatment the manager gave us . the server was nice . that was the reason for atleast one star . but i dont think i will be coming back . need to work on guest service and compensation . im not talking about $ 2.95 for the chips and salsa . maybe we need a health inspector to come down and check this place out . or a dirty dining channel 13 stop ....
mexican	the service was decent . i would not recommend coming just for tacos maybe if i was here for the bar it might be different .
mexican	after checking out the menu i was pleasantly surprised how cheap the food was . the drinks were really reasonable . i ordered a marguerita on the rocks with an additional $ 3 shot . for food i had the tacos , one chicken and one spicy beef . the verdict : drink was great , food unfortunately not very good . the chicken taco filling looked like cream of chicken soup and the spicy beef was just terrible . i hate giving bad reviews , but it just wasn 't all that great . ill be back though to enjoy the taste drinks .
mexican	i 've been to the other locations which were busy and a lot going on , but this one was awkwardly quiet and boring . even the waitress was super quiet . food was good , but i 'd rather visit the larger locations for a better ambiance
mexican	our waitress was really sweet , but the girl helping her was a nightmare . so rude . they wound up forgetting one of my tacos . chips & salsa were good , tacos were meh , service was horrendous . we had to ask 3 different people for a high chair for my daughter and it didn 't come until halfway through our meal . will not be going back . 2 stars for the blood orange margarita and the cute atmosphere . i had high hopes for this place but sadly was let down .
mexican	service by the waitress could have been much better even for a $ restaurant . ordered the cebada drink but they did not have any . asked for a glass of water but they only had bottled so i took it . i had carne asada tacos and cabeza . the tortillas for the former were dry and so was the meat . the cabeza was okay and the corn tortillas were made here so it helped although not enough to receive any more then a single star .
mexican	came on a thursday night. had the shrimp , baja fish and barbacoa tacos. they were all decent , nothing to really rave about. wait time was about 30 min. waiter was attentive but got all the orders wrong and tried to compensate by giving us free tacos .
mexican	yes and yes , it seems like . this has to be the slowest chipotle in the nation ... i will drive out of my way to go to other locations just to avoid the cashier who is there at night and wants to have really awkward conversations with everyone in line . i even tried to be on my phone one time so i could avoid it . if you need to finish a book , head over to chipotle and wait in line . you 'll have the time to read that and maybe another .
mexican	we all ordered fish tacos , after waiting 20 minutes we received our tacos in takeout bags ( which we didn 't ask for ) . we opened our containers to find ice cold tacos filled with lettuce ( we had to search to find the fish in them ) . not worth the money , left disappointed . would not recommend
mexican	charged full price for my $ 6 footlong and didn 't realize it until i drove away ...
mexican	host was great but service at table was horrible . cheryl our waitress was horrible . worst attitude and very dismissive . good came out cold . had the mahi tacos / steak tacos / brussel sprout and macn cheese . both sets of tacos came out cold . not happy especially for what they charge - you get a single taco for $ 5 during beat the clock time . wow . ripoff ordered drinks and glass came with a very apparent chip in the glass . we are locals and honestly we will most likely never be back here . way too many places on the strip where the i would stay away .
mexican	plan on at least two hours for dinner and a lot of waiting , and lies about how long until your food arrives . will not be coming back here again- management was notified and didn 't do anything about it either . just claimed they are busy- clearly , but shouldn 't take more than an hour to make tacos .
mexican	worst over priced dinner i have ever had . canned beans chicken was tasteless and dry . my friends order was dry meat with awful sauce . terrible so bad i couldn 't eat my food .
mexican	food is just as good as taco bell and the service is worse . margaritas suck .
mexican	he was upset i couldn 't make an option fast enough , and spoke to me like i was an idiot . speaking so slow like didn 't understand english . lastly when i got my food and left i put my hand in the bag to grab a fry and felt that they didn 't put the lid on my secret sauce and it was all over everything . fried , tacos and burger . gross . never again . it 's sad i like they 're food too since it was my first job in high school
mexican	n * * * * * this and that every 5 seconds. they didn 't even turn it down when someone walked into the dining room .
mexican	i was appalled by the poor service we received . while placing our order , the girl at the window had an attitude as if we were inconveniencing her by placing our order . she kept trying to rush us even though we had more items to add to our order . then upon pulling up to the window , we were given the wrong item . when we brought it to her attention , no apology whatsoever . there was just a whole air of poor customer service . now i remember why i was never a big fan of del taco . will be awhile before i return to this location .
mexican	now i wait for him to respond ... literal dead silence for probably 3 minutes ! then i hear " were you ready to order ? " i then repeat everything ! cashier was nice when i got to the window and apologized . i 'm usually satisfied with the great service here but in the end only to get home and my combo is incorrect ! disappointed in tonight 's service and i 'm a frequent customer : (
mexican	time is now 6 : 52 and there 's still 2 cars in front of me . bad bad service not the first time that this happens either ..
mexican	we were all a bit disappointed with the food , even through the service was great and the restaurant itself had a fun and energetic vibe . i had four tacos , only two of which i can say i liked ( rio chicken and cauliflower ) , and one which i only finished as not to waste the food ( mushroom ) . i wasn 't a big fan of the corn / flour blend tortillas , and most of the tacos had a poor filling to tortilla ratio ... to the point where almost half of the bites of taco were simply carbs .
mexican	have come here since i can remember but it 's literally going downhill . this visit the service was so bad ! we waited 15 minutes before someone came to get our drink order and bring us chips . when we got our food it was just warm ... we waited forever to get our bill and no one came to get it , we literally had to hunt someone down ... it wasn 't even that busy ... been this way last few times of coming here .. this might just be th last .
mexican	checked with yelp . wanted mexican found mexican half mile away . rated 4 stars , has to be good , right ? i had 3 tamales dinner . wife had flautos 2 margaritas some of the worst food i have ever eaten . but i 'm thinking 4 stars , was up ? boom , hits me like a hooker with a sap. this is a college town . everyone eating in there is of teenage age years or very early 20 's , looking all dopey and stupid . they don 't know what they are eating . you could be giving them white bread with corn beef hash in there and they will think it 's fine dinning .
mexican	i 've been to the 7th ave location . loved it . northern location not so great . the albondiga soup didn 't have any taste to it had to add salt and pepper to give it flavor and the corn tortillas were micro waved and hard . the chips were good . will give it another try another day .
mexican	its now 11 am and still not open . i don 't understand what business doesn 't have hours posted .
mexican	came to get some burritos and i swear the lady and one of the cooks were drinking a corona while working like seriously who does that i took a picture but i don 't really know how to posts picture here
mexican	what happened to their quality and service ? we ate their march 2016 will never go back ! did not enjoy the food or service ray
mexican	used to be favorite mexican food , tonight very disappointed hot hot sauce very watered down sauce would not even stay on chip . was my favorite hot sauce . plus changed menu i orderd red chili chimi wasn 't fried came out very soggy told waiter she told me to get sauce on side next time
mexican	the water the cucumber is still good . cardenas has better kitchen food .
mexican	then driving all the way home over 10 minutes to find out you can 't even get the order correctly . & you refuse to fix the issue you caused . then you bring out your " head " manager and continue to argue with the customer . i thought the customer was always right , especially since this was your fault . you don 't listen , you rush me out the drive thru . yeah let 's just say this is the worst mcdonalds .
mexican	my guess is the health inspectors are coming . this place is always disgusting . the staff is rude and act like you are inconveniencing them by being there to order your food . skip this mcdonald 's all together .
mexican	at least four people that ordered after me received their food first and my order was taken incorrectly .
mexican	we pulled up to the second window and saw someone behind the counter cleaning and completely ignored us . ended up having to drive to another mcdonalds instead .
mexican	really enjoyed the food , and considered it better than mucho burrito .
mexican	it clearly states on the window that your food is free if you don 't get a receipt . i called them out on this and they put up a big fight saying that they did give me the receipt , when of course they did not . the food is bomb , but you shouldn 't put this on your window if you aren 't going to honor it . them crisscut fries though !
mexican	it was the worst ceviche i 've ever had . had absolutely no flavor and soaked in water .. completely over priced for that type of service and flavorless food . i was extremely disappointed . the manager did take off all of our ceviche orders , which was nice . but i won 't be going back there .
mexican	i called to ask if they had closed early and said they must have locked the doors to early . i ordered a burrito like usual and sat to wait . 10 minutes went by before the manager came to me and asked if i wanted tacos instead because she had already put the beans and rice away ... if i wanted tacos i would have asked for them and if burritos weren 't available then don 't waste my time and allow me to buy them . if the business is to close the doors at 9 : 30 then maybe the business should be fully operational till 9 : 30 . going to give rubios a break for a while .
mexican	came to this place after i went to the swap meet with my friends ... not one table was clean no where to sit so i went to the cashier to see if someone can clean a table for us and she said she 'll send someone right away. after waiting 15 minutes for a table finally someone came out to clean it with a very bad attitude ... everything is very over priced and not worth the pay the aguas frescas are not that great very blend taste ... dirty tables dirty floors terrible service overall never coming back i don 't recommend this place to anyone ..
mexican	what the hell is he doing working here if he doesn 't know what they are selling
mexican	i came home w my side salad missing and the breast part looked it was cut in half . such a waste of $ 7 .
mexican	my sunday was not fun because of the experience i received . be wary that the " complimentary " chips and salsa is not . being charged for a salsa refill without any warning was a lovely surprise on the check . what mexican food place has ever charged you for a salsa refill ? ! if you want any sort of service don 't sit on the patio either . we were neglected to say the least and our waitress dropped the check randomly when we were going to order more drinks . terrible reggae playlist .
mexican	came to this place yesterday and it was fantastic the people at the country terms togoed our food and wrapped it with foil and then today came the lady was rude as hell giving an attitude then saying there 's a limit to the sauces and then to top it all off , she said if you wanted togo you have to say it to the people makinf the food and instead gave me the foil and said to do it myself .. so much for tip ! ! ! !
mexican	seriously , only reason we ate anything past the appetizer was bc we were hungry . to start , there 's no denying beans were straight from a can- nasty ! rice was bland and tasted old . tacos all together were no good . seafood tacos : flavors just did not go together at all ! everything else was bland- even the margarita : ( , i left with a stomach ache and let 's just say i 'll never go again . i would 've had a better chance at taco bell .
mexican	i would not come again although it sure looked like a fun place . i got the carne asasa burrito . first bite pulled out a huge chunk of meat that should have been much more portionable . three of us got the tortilla soup . presentation was on par but taste was not . over all the flavors wet just not interesting . the gringo sante fe come with no frys . just oddness all round .
mexican	there were only 2 people working . the wait was incredibly long . the people before our group demanded to have their money back . they made a huge fuss . we just went with be flow . for the price of what you get , the food was just okay . skip this place . any other tex mex would suffice . i will say that the staff were very kind and understanding , despite their own frustrations .
mexican	the food looked great but didn 't justify in taste , the corn was cold and was lacking salt and a hint of butter ... we had the cod and steak tacos and they were tasteless . all you can feel was the heat from the sauces , horrible . the food was just bland and lacked salt big time . i would rather make tacos at home . the prices are some what ridiculous . you will be happier in chipotle . 2 stars for the $ 5 tall boy special
mexican	ordered ceviche good but nothing at all special small for the price . husband ordered 2 tacos and bowl of noodles which was tasty . i was left not full i asked waiter if we could have salsa & chips , which was brought out after asking for them you would expect automatic especially for a high priced restaurant . salsa was not special . food is pricey for such a small amount of food . was hungry after an hour and a half later .
mexican	came with some friends to grab some tacos ... there was only one cook ... said it would take about 15 to 20 min ... one gentleman stood up and said he 's been waiting and the cook started yelling and cursing at the guy ... he was so loud and we ended up leaving and didn 't order anything ... i felt so bad for the man .. it was the worst customer service ever ... very disrespectful
mexican	always out of ingredients . last time they were out of corn as well as carnitas . what is the point ? sometimes there will be online orders ahead of you and they will forget about you and make about twenty orders instead of yours while yours sits there and gets cold . i 've never experienced that at another chipotle .
mexican	jalapeno burger no lettuce or tomato . the high school flunkies who wonder why they can do any better gave me some burger with guacamole and no jalapenos but it had lettuce and tomato on it . worthless humans wasting valuable resources . i hope they are all sterile and cannot reproduce to end the world of their bloodline and existance .
mexican	long john silver 's at least has some fish in their fish tacos . will not return . they did try to bring something else . chicken burrito . it was ok at best .
mexican	salty . zero taste . haven 't felt good in four days since i ate there . stay away
mexican	we threw our salty food away and hopped over to yogurt land .
mexican	can i give a 0 star ? ? ? they suck , i tell them no cheese on my tacos and they give me extra cheese ... i can see if it only happened once .. i tried to give them another chance but nope forget them .. i 'll take my money elsewhere .. i 'm allergic .. and then the receipt on top of the taco said no cheese .. i think they do the shit on purpose ..
mexican	can i give it a 0 star ( were closed ) the bamba bamba big woman said wen we arrived at 3.05 a.m and they closed at 4 a.m what a shit
mexican	too many college students , if you want to actually eat , don 't come here ,
mexican	service was mediocre , at best ; drinks were bland ; food looked like it had been thrown together with no care , whatsoever . yet another crappy restaurant in toronto ... don 't waste your money or time with this place . if you want mexican , head down the street to la carnita for better ... everything !
mexican	then i receive my margarita ..... it was pure water . this place lacks everything ! taste , authenticity , everything ! ! ! please don 't waste your time . oh and venue sucks too !
mexican	my wife ordered the carnitas burrito and i had the don flautas . disgusting . worst meal for both of us that we have had in a long , long time . the service was slightly below average . the atmosphere is nice but that 's about it .
mexican	i was not happy with the service or the food here ! i 'm hoping this was just a bad day ! but it really doesn 't matter because i wont be ever eat at this particular chipotle again in life ! ! ! ! !
mexican	chips and salsa are great when they give it to you because your food is gonna take a minute and it 's gonna taste so good . nope . neither . vegan ? nope , nice try . they gave my girlfriend a plate a vegetable slop and told us the rice was no longer vegan . they really tried to make it right , and i commend them for doing that ... but ultimately this place is a terrible mess and definitely not worth checking out with all the delicious choices in town . awful . just awful .
mexican	all 8 of us we sick for 5 days after eating here last saturday night . i really hope that management reads this and responds ...
mexican	we walked in at 930 pm no one there to greet us . finally found someone in the bar , and she said she was closing early because it was slow . um dont post ur open til 11 if u are going to close whenever u want .
mexican	as soon as we walked in the cashier looked at us and walked in the back and never came back out . the cooks were outside smoking and gossiping about the night before 's drunk . this was at 6 pm . prime dinner time . the tables were all dirty . the visible part of the kitchen was messy and cross contaminated . overall , we were flagrantly ignored . we left after ten minutes of non-service . i was very sad because i had heard such good reviews and the menu looked good , but the facilities were sketchy .
mexican	can i not score this lower ? no extra large cups ever wait forever in drive thru and the only car employees need a smoke more than a job where customer service is provided
mexican	my husband and i thought that we would give this place a try he got the chili verda burrito it looked like someone took the inside of a babies diaper that had the runs and dumped it into the burrito i got the carne asada and where is the beans rice plus the first few bight are of tortilla this place is nasty will never go back there
mexican	the onion slices in each brito are like giant toenails . worst filiberto 's ever ! ! !
mexican	the only okay dish was their chips and salsa . do not order the enchilada suiza . it tastes nasty and do not order their beans and rice . terrible and more terrible . can i say more ? no !
mexican	eating by myself on saturday night at the bar , i get in because they have a full vegan menu . waited a good 10 minutes before to be able to order , the bartender , elizabeth was so busy texting . and disappear for a good 4 minutes , i don 't know where . i ordered some vegan chicken tacos who had no salsa and absolutely no flavor . the rice smell and taste like baking soda . order don julio and of course they are out . at not one point of time she asked me if my meal was ok . i hate going out for dinner and waist my time and money .
mexican	i 've been to a few other locations around the valley and they were on point . today , this experience was really shitty and it probably has to do with the leaders of worker bees there . my food was cold , the cashier didn 't know how to utilize my app to redeem rewards , the tables were disgusting and we had to clean it up ourselves . my food came out portion by portion . one piece of chicken was hot and juicy but the wing was small cold and i couldn 't find the meat on the bone . i def won 't be coming back to this location ever again !
mexican	why they have all these high reviews is beyond me . try it for yourself . but you have been advised to find a better mexican joint ... won 't be back .. oh , and be sure to try there homemade canned guacamole .. waitres dropped cap from salt shaker on floor , rolled around , picked it up , screwed back onto salt shaker and put back on table , didnt even bother to wipe it off , do they wash there hands after using the toilet ?
mexican	but the food isn 't worth it when you have a careless , rude and lackadaisical staff . the line is always longer then normal stores . the staff is always rushed and never personable not to mention half the time they skimp on portions and when you ask for more they have an attitude about it ! had to throw my burrito away after finding a hair in it ! !
mexican	slow service , people who came in 20 minutes after we were seated got their meals before we had received our drinks , let alone order meals . fajitas we 're scorched badly . the order was incorrect , as well . i asked three times for a fresh drink and after45 minutes told her to just forget it . so disappointed .
mexican	food at this location is always terrible and the place is always filthy .
mexican	had the nitro nachos ... eek , me thinks not ! poor quality ingredients . if they mess up nachos with simple ingredients what other harm can they do w / the rest of their menu . restaurant its self needs a little sanitizing & sweeping . i would feel bad about the glass my beer came in but they serve in red solo cups . first time i 'm happy to see them .
mexican	do you intentionally leave food that i have paid for out of my bag ? ! i am beginning to think that it is on purpose ! every single time and i still return ? ! ? apparently , i should be double checking my bag before i leave ... well i would , if you wouldn 't tie it in a knot ; ( i think that i like to help their profit margin and starve at least one of my kids every time : (
mexican	cant believe horrible service and food awful nothing is fresh taste like garbage need better products the lettuce salad like 4 days old ne c er coming back
mexican	i ordered 2 gorditas , when i got to work ( 4 min away ) craving to eat my gorditas i opened the box and what a surprise the tortilla was cold with a slap of meat inside , sour cream on the side with a little lettuce . never again ..... i don 't recommend this place at all ...
mexican	had the 3 tacos and the food was stale and chicken tasted old . went to complain and the people just answer me with an " oh is it ? " i asked for a refund and was told manager wasn 't on duty to give me a refund . well they just lost my business completely as i work next door . this place shouldn 't be allowed to operate with the expired food they serving .
mexican	stood in line for seemed like 10 mins . the lady , two people infront of me , ordered a family meal . then the clever guy yells , " okay , we are out of breast . " so i turned around and walked out .
mexican	today saturday came to the restaurant and after review by the web where said that is open from 9am to 9pm . arriving at 10am still the place was close. drove very far to eat a colombian breakfast . please up dated the website and don 't waist people time .
mexican	very disappointed . had heard such good reviews everywhere . the margaritas , too pricey - served in plastic glasses - were weak and a few steps below lime aid - we waited in the patio - had to get our own drinks and no chips / salsa while we waited for our table - food was decent but nothing to rave about , really lame to have to pay extras for additional chips and salsa and the forks were , even though not plastic , like something out of a camping or picnic kit - won 't go back - too many other really good mexican places in the valley . "
mexican	this place was awful . bland watery chicken , salsa had no flavor , even the mango salsa . it just tasted like pieces of mango . the staff was neither here nor there . they seemed a little tired actually . i found it funny that the menu had descriptions but they ask you what you want as they make it . don 't waste your time here , go to chipotle , baja loco , heck even rubios . seriously don 't bother unless you like to eat soggy cardboard .
mexican	the guac is from frozen , cheese is cheapest shredded stuff you can get , oily food , hardly any spices . taco bell is better than this place and much cheaper ... won 't be returning .
mexican	employees here are rude as hell too . i hate this location . 10 / 10 avoid
mexican	wanted to give it a shot and drove all the way across town to try it and by the time we got there everyone has to use the restroom . so i ask where it is and the kid behind the counter tells me they don 't have a restroom . so i ask him where he goes & he looks around and was like " uh you could use the liquor store next door . " rude . yeah no thanks . ill pass . we left without ordering .
mexican	i have never used an ampm for gas in the last 5 years for this very reason , now i will never use their mini mart . bad business .
mexican	i get home and the order is always screwed up . get someone who speaks english taking orders .
mexican	only can recommend that if you 'd like to keep your money flow coming in , is to have the workers fix their attitudes . using words like ' yep ' instead of ' yes ' or not giving the total just saying ' drive to the 1st window ' is lack of customer service .
mexican	the salsa station was filthy , the nachos are loaded with so much sour cream and onions and not layered . they become soggie immediately . no onions i asked for and of course i get extra onion . give me my money back and will not go here again .
mexican	cant get a simple order right and they act as if your in the wrong when you ask them to fix it
mexican	went inside to eat . ordered a burrito supreme . sat down with my husband opened my burrito and there was a long black hair wrapped up in the tortilla . gross- got a refund nothing more offered for an apology . won 't be back
mexican	so got this walked in with a meal that followed my diet and was going to get drinks and they told me i had to eat my meal outside on the curb . fail fail fail
mexican	the older blonde lady is absolutely the meanest , rudest person . you walk people to their table ... check yourself . cocktails and beers are good . good selection . quite tasty . food was ok . average . tako is way way way better . more flavor . more interesting combinations . the food was fresh though . service is slow and not the most attentive . if you are busy , hire more people . and get rid of your hostess . with all the other taco options in this city ... i would not come back .
mexican	can this place get an order correct the 1st time ? i think not !
mexican	that 's why the two stars . however , we were not a fan of the food at all . the food was luke warm upon arrival . some of the food was spicy without warning . the flavors were bland and lacked flavor . i guess to new age mexican for us . we prefer the real deal mom & pop mexican style restaurants where the flavors are right on and you get fresh chips when you order two dips .
mexican	they need the san diego guys to come teach them how to make some good old fashion taco shop food . disgraceful to the roberto 's name .
mexican	cant never come her late yall service is trash your staff is trash how tf you gunna look at me sideways cuz i walked up to your window dont for get my fucking straw simple ... then yall dont give no chilling on my chilli cheese fries how fucking stupid yall niggas is retarded everywhere at all del tacos worldwide
mexican	i placed a small catering orders online two different times , and both times they got all of it wrong . avoid this location
mexican	inclined to believe the people at this location and the one on 71 n nellis blvd lv . nv . 89110 have the same problems . only bright spot was nick the cashier . d carballo
mexican	would be nice if they would open up the place for the large crowds that gather early for first flights out . maybe they don 't like money and people .
mexican	there 's better tapas at firefly . the hidden pizza joint next door is a more satisfying meal . the cosmo better step it up food wise . it 's highway robbery for very so-so quality food . they obviously want more of a vibe than a great place to eat . great food gets return customers . everyone on that 3rd floor are in for a surprise in a year from now ....
mexican	margarita wasn 't very good . had to ask for everything including utensils .
mexican	while eating our salsa and chips i nearly chocked on a rubber band from the salsa . i notified our waitress immediately and the manager casually apologized for the mishap . not only he did not offer to comp the meal it seems to me that he didn 't think it was big deal . i checked on the sanitation score when i left and it was 92 % and now it all make sense ! very disappointed with my visit .
mexican	went through the drive through and had to wait about 3-4 minutes before someone even took my order . then waited another 5 minutes before i got to the window ( there was only 1 car in front of me ) . once i got to the window they repeated an order that wasn 't mine , so i had to repeat it . they took my money and then i sat for over 10 minutes ! the manager passed by the window a number of times and never made eye contact . they opened the window only to tell me that it would be another 4 minutes and i should pull around to wait . i could 've made my own chicken dinner at that point .
mexican	apperently the girl working the register at 2 : 35 pm on this day doesn 't like her job one bit ! rude as could be , and not only to me , but the 4 customers in front of me ! no smile , no kindness what so ever ! shape up young lady or i fear your job status may change in the near future ! this was my firsr and last visit ! grunpy people shouldn 't work with the public ! managers .... this one will run off more customers than she 'll bring in for sure ! ! !
mexican	tacos were so bleh and beans were out of a can .
mexican	btw we have brown and red hair so clearly didn 't belong to us ! !
mexican	the owner and staff openly eat their shift meals in front of customers , letting the service time suffer . we went there a couple of times to see if it was a fluke but no , the owner was yelling at staff when we walked in , and we waited over half an hour for service and finally left . maybe if the owner wasn 't so busy making his staff feel useless we might have gotten some service . do not go here ! if you have a hankering for mexican food , go to taco bell ! it is a huge step up in quality !
mexican	called in a order for ten with rice beans and chips . was looking forward to bringing some mexican yummyness to the family . after taking my whole order for this meal guy on phone said no you can 't take it to go . what ? ! thx for nothing
mexican	can you guys please use like half to 1 / 4 the salt you are currently using ? ? ? your food is waaaaaay too salty !
mexican	drove by and it 's shut down ( as of october 27 ) .
mexican	they loose numerous customers who drive off because of this . they need to learn meaning of fast food .
mexican	( i think they were $ 3.75 ) it 's casual as you order at the counter , seat yourself and wait for your number to be called . they also serve breakfast items all day and all your mexi favorites . caramba is a better alternative to taco bell or chipolte and offers a large patio and is one of the better fast casual mexican restaurants in the immediate area . many caramba locations are in the area .
mexican	so amazing , but unfortunately they have really gone down hill . the last few times the quality has gotten bad . to go orders are always wrong . they get chintzy with sour cream , etc . when i called today to report an issue with my order , he totally blew me offf & even laughed about it .... i will not be going back because it has gotten so bad ! ! i 've been eating here since the early 90 's but there are much better places to go now .
mexican	the service isn 't that great but when the service and food are both good , about every third or fourth visit , it 's really good .
mexican	careful where you eat , a lot of their stuff is expired but frozen so it appears odorless
mexican	dun , dun , dunnnn ! the sopapilla tasted bland . no flavor , no texture , nothing . i would 've enjoyed a kfc biscuit a lot better . my girlfriend was having hot flashes in the smoldering restaurant . the new mexican art they had on the walls were tacky and not art . from mexico with love : )
mexican	i really wonder what it used to be . but , now it 's carlos o 'brien 's . if you are dining in , order the queso dip . it is delicious ! but that 's really all i would recommend . everything else is mediocre and super cheesy . however , if you are using them to cater , i say order the mini chimis , mini tacos and mini flautas . great price to feed a large party at your house . also , with the size , there is never a wait .
mexican	after their renovation , they 've turned it into an extremely loud bar environment with poor service . the $ 1 tacos are now $ 2 with less food ( no side rice ) and fewer fillings ( absolutely do not order the vegetarian tacos - what used to be beans and vegetables is now just corn and avocado ) . it may have been an issue that we were there on st patricks day but i 've heard similar reviews from other people who have gone . i used to go to carlos & pepes every sunday and now i 'm sure that i will not return .
mexican	no flavor whatsoever . will not be coming back . also , wish bathroom was a lot cleaner too .
mexican	carne asada burrito and the meat was kinda tough and there asada burrito doesn 't come with anything when you order it like no cheese in it cost extra
mexican	other daughter loved the asada fries . carne asada tacos decent . shrimp enchiladas too sweet for my liking .... ketchup like ..... eeeeeeew . $ 52 bucks for 4 of us .
mexican	steak tasted old and dry . better off going to taco bell . never going back .
mexican	i asked for two beef tacos and they charge for the complete meal but only give the tacos . plus the drive-thru is hella slow .
mexican	1st time there , was in wrong line , but they knew i didn 't know what the f i was doing . get in the correct line , get your order , go to cashier . as i have an onion allergy , i tried to order no onions - but not really working that well . so the fries are just ordinary shoestring cut , with some meat and paste of white , cheese oil , and green paste. some people think this is great .. but i wasn 't drunk . so , if you like quick , greasy , loud , food - just like tijuana- go there. if you have any food allergies , don 't go. pretty easy .
mexican	on my second visit , i opted for the green chile burrito ... the tortilla was nothing special , and the chile was bland . you call that a green sauce ? as the green , gravy like mixture spilled everywhere , i tried to enjoy it with some tortilla chips . their chips aren 't anything special either . i like the salsa bar and the atmosphere , but when it comes to a quick mexican dining experience , i know you can do tons better . i don 't hate this place , but the bar is set higher in the desert .
mexican	im from so cal , we have amazing mexican food especially quick shops like this . i feel like they should care more about their meat quality . their hot salsa ( red ) has zero flavor . the place is really dirty , i can 't imagine its clean in the kitchen .
mexican	the woman who took my order had trouble communicating in english . and they have a no substitutions policy , so you 're stuck paying $ 2 more for an equivalent burrito or eating their nasty pico de gallo .
mexican	nasty ! the staff was super rude too . yuck . yuck . yuck . skip it ! !
mexican	drinks are weak . chile rellenos are the worst . ever . very bland restaurant .
mexican	no flavor . i have eaten here twice both meals terrible .
mexican	the coca cola ones were ribs in a sweet sauce like bbq and the regular ones were ribs with salty sauce . beans were great so were the homemade flour tortillas . they need to learn to make carnitas estilo michuacan
mexican	nachos a-ok . tater tots a-ok . my stomach doesn 't like the beef tacos .
mexican	our server , beto , didn 't write down our order so he forgot the beer battered taco . they arrived after we were done with our other food . bloody mary was not good , watered down . make sure to request any server except beto . no refills , he didn 't seem to really care that we were there . we sat for 20 minutes waiting for our check while he sat on his chair talking with his friends . never cleared our plates .
mexican	the lone asada taco saved a one start review . ordered chips and salsa . the red salsa tasted like hot sauce . after two bites , everything ended up in the trash .
mexican	but just a word of warning . when you get a take out order , double check it before you go . my last two orders were short . they will not do anything about it unless you drive all the way back and bring your card . the manager was no help what so ever . so carolinas if you are reading this the manager on wed may 24 tel your manager to work on his customer service skills .
mexican	carolinas , your enchiladas ruined it for me. i can 't imagine eating another one of your soggy tortillas swamped in a pool of the most horrifying enchilada sauce my taste buds have ever met. mole overload and non-existent chile. lacking any real taste to it whatsoever. disappointed .
mexican	they no longer do their patatas bravas , which was a highlight of their menu , and their new bowls leave a lot to be desired . their lemon tajine rice is dry and overcooked , and their bowls , while packed with flavour , lack balance . their chicken is still super juicy and tender , but now the dishes that go with the chicken are sup bar . not sure i 'll be visiting as often now , unfortunately .
mexican	brushes barely clean car and my car was pretty clean just drizzle from last might rain. ithe blowers barely get the water from the front of the car and completely miss the back of the car . never will go there again . place was clean and lady was nice .
mexican	she recommended faustos and swore up and down that it was great . i always go to pepe 's for my super nachos fix because their meat and beans are very tasty and the use of melted nacho cheese ( like the kind you find at gas stations ) makes theirs # 1 in my book but we figured we 'd give this joint a shot . the food was not bad at all but ok at best , the atmosphere was clean and festive and the employees were nice but this reminded me of a knock off roberto 's , which i dont care for much . # enjoylife # eatwell
mexican	more variety of salsas . overall the food was tasty ..
mexican	huge ass fucking eyelashes looking like she about to fly away from everyone 's bullshit . all the girls there are rude and they never smile . look like they hate their job , as if it 's my fault that they 're working @ a damn torta joint. customer service sucks in general . i enjoyed the food but the females there just make it a shitty place , with their attitudes and not friendly service . if you 're gonna work somewhere , why not be friendly and try to at least enjoy your damn job ? also they play shitty messssican music 1 star for the crappy service . 4 for the food or whatevaaaa
mexican	i came today which is maybe 2 days later. the manager said he would leave a note. when i arrived i spoke with the manger on duty which didn 't know so he called the guy i spoke with who com firmed my story when he came back he said oh i 'll give it to you but you were supposed to get it that day . so i 'm guessing that they put a time frame on when you can pick up your money that there no counting ass cashiers fuck up on if i didn 't come back i know they would have pocketed it no good pos .
mexican	she quickly put it in the drawer so no way to challenge her . also the tostado i got had a hard substance like a rock . be careful at this location . bad people & bad food .
mexican	he told me they don 't so we left .
mexican	the guy at pickup counter was a complete a * * hole ! horrible attitude and demeanor . i 'll pass this review to other students and residents of dt tempe . should 've gone to taco bell !
mexican	cashier : where are you from ? me : michigan cashier : no like where are you really from ? your accent me : michigan but my blood is palestinian if that 's what you 're asking for cashier : oh ya i have some friends that are from bosnia
mexican	cash only . another cheap place that doesn 't want to pay credit card fees . greed rules here.and no , i don 't want to pay $ 6 to use your airport style atm . tee pee is better and takes plastic . adios don jose .
mexican	i ordered the # 9 chile relleno . it wasn 't bad but , not the best i 've had . if your in a pinch this will do . the rice and beans are extremely good and the horchata wasn 't all sugar like other places . definitely a casual place just to hang and grab a quick bite . it 's outdoor seating . clean enough for the area it 's located in .
mexican	we had the chicken , beef , fish and chorizo tacos . soft taco shells were dry and the filling wasn 't impressive . we had take-out and the service was fast and friendly . next time i 'll try something else on the menu .
mexican	nice location . and i love mexican food ; i eat it all the time so i know what good mexican food is ... and isn 't . despite the food looking the part , all of the things that make mexican food mexican food were missing from mucho gusto 's machaca ... like taste . so to me having to pay the prices their menu items command is not worth it . not only is the food sub-par , but the prices are inflated . much gusto is overhyped and you will pay a premium for the not-so-goodwill . i will not return .
mexican	caught them before closing time , being generous with 2 stars regardless the tacos were mediocre at best .
mexican	chips were not fresh , salsa and beans were blan / no taste . service was not too good , water was not refilled . all in all , was not happy with the service or the food on this special occasion . will not return .
mexican	the chicken was really , really plain : no sauce no spice no nothing . disappointing . plantains that came with it were perfect . potatoes with it just potatoes , plain . red snapper was also good , good flavor ( not great ) , but required / needed hot sauce , there just wasn 't enough flavor there on its own . rum flight was also very good and they have a good selection of beers and wine . service was also excellent . i 've had much better latin cuisine and much cheaper places . was really hoping this place was going to knock my socks off because it 's just around the corner .
mexican	the tortilla for the tacos al pastor crumbled in my hands -could not have been recently made and the meat was on the dry side . overall conclusion was that this weekday lunch may not have been the best time to try this place out for the first time .
mexican	the food is just okay , about what you would expect from mass-chain mexican . they usually have nightly specials and drink specials in the bar . average price to expect for an adult getting an entree and a cold one , $ 15-17 . the best things are the nice big , fresh chips and the ample portions . too bad the house salsa tastes like pace from a jar . 2.5 stars at best but not offensive .
mexican	honestly , i love chipotle . i 've had it in numerous places , always enjoyed a big juicy burrito , but this one ... the worst of the worst . my burrito was half-sized , and most of the ingredients were overhelmed by rice and beans . barbacoa was tough and dry ... rice was dry too , corn was pale and weird . pretty much all of the ingredients tasted different ! never again .
mexican	crazy won 't go back and the portion was smaller too ! ! !
mexican	i 've been coming here for years . the busier they are the worse the customer service is . i get that the hurry and hustle is part of the " experience . " but when you can 't hear me and i can 't see you or my food because the glass / pillars are in the way , it 's no longer " fun , " yet rudeness ensues on the part of their team members . then my order is wrong and they are annoyed . it 'll be awhile before i come back .
mexican	i have had hotdogs from here before and they are good . but come on if your hours on here say your open from a certain time to a certain time go by it . not even a sign on the door saying the times or days your open .
mexican	it 's 1am on saturday and its crickets out front of your door . thanks for nothing .
mexican	change your times , 20 min drive to come here yelp said it closes at 1am got here at 11 pm and the girl said they were closing very frustrating
mexican	literally , i had to elbow myself through the crowd to get to the order window only to find out that the meat i wanted was served at another window . whaaaaattt ! ! ! where are the signs and the orderly queues ? the atmosphere was obviously too authentic for this gringo : i ended up leaving since having to wait in the correct queue for another 10 minutes was too much for my starving family .
mexican	food always comes out wrong ! only good thing is it is open when ever !
mexican	the sign in the window said debit cards are charged . however i handed them my visa debit / credit card and they used it as a debit instead credit . i did not give them a pin number . it should have been impossible for them to use my card as a debit without the pin , so how did they do that ? i think someone should investigate .
mexican	charged me for food they didnt give me , when i called they told me i dont know , what do you want and i said i want a refund he said bye and come in the morning ..... i want to eat my food and can 't wait i till the morning to come back and get a refund horrible customer service ...... hung up on me 3 times ....
mexican	then , order was wrong , then refused to give me back what i was overcharged for . when i opened my irder 2 items wete missing including what i had been charged for that i didnt order . on top of that they didnt toadt my bagel or put butter on it as asked .
mexican	fire ants on the patio - beware . poor service and mediocre food . i will not be back !
mexican	charge me 20.00 for steak fries and a taco with extra guacamole , something doesn 't add up !
mexican	they give you a very small amount with chips and don 't tell you to use it sparingly because no more salsa for you a unless you pay extra . it 's mexican food for crying out loud and you need salsa . rip off and i will not go back .
mexican	this little mexican place is a seat yourself and kill some time experience . overpriced for what it is i at least didn 't feel hassled and the staff were friendly while i killed some time with my queso . the menu is a bit confusing for no good reason , but airport eating is a low expectation experience . despite my jet lag i would go back and get a full meal .
mexican	240 n. sunway in gilbert is , in fact , a tire store . thanks for ruining my lunch small dancing rodent ! !
mexican	i enjoyed the tacos . but my cheese enchilada , rice and beans were terrible , not sure how you mess those up it mission accomplished . salsa is good . our waitress was very kind . would and will never go back .
mexican	any buffet at any casino slopes out , better grinds than this generic spot . compared to this place , roberto 's tastes like the president of mexico 's , own grandmothers handmade recipes ! avoid at all costs .. , ,
mexican	reminds me of a taco shop subway . meats premade so they don 't always have what 's on the menu . tacos were ok , but not great . chips tasted like old grease .
mexican	at $ 1.75 you can drink a lot of margaritas and pretend the food is good . soon the buzz will wear off and you 'll have a headache and think you ate mexican buffet at panchos . friendly service though
mexican	and notice in my account that they took off 75 dollars which it was on hold . so i went back and talk to the manager and they told me that when you use a debit card and run it as credit 75 dollar hold comes out of your account . i 've been to lots of ampms / gas stations . this is the first i seen this never going here again . if you pay for gas just pay for it on cash . if i would of new this before i would never put gas here . still they haven 't put my money back its been 5 days . i wonder how long it will take they said 2 to 3 days .
mexican	greasy tex-mex . decent service . weird smell that permeates the entire restaurant . very dark inside .
mexican	little toppings , tasteless and these people only take cash which makes it a hassle when you are at home with no cash and decide you want to order in
mexican	lol ... try the toothpick size breakfast burritos . lol or the ice with pop to go .
mexican	salty , salty , salty and not good . horrible mexican food . enough said . the chips were good though .... green salsa , red salsa and beans ! ! ! it wasn 't the waiter / waitress ' fault for the taste ... they exchanged my friend 's meal twice free of charge ! thanks management !
mexican	that is just the start . you 'd be hard pressed to find unfriendly chipotle staff . these people are among the friendliest i have encountered . but , they are cheap on the rice , let alone the meat . how else do you improve same store profitability ? i 've had better . recently their guacamole is pretty good .
mexican	i got the shrimp tacos , they were street style which i enjoyed but their was not much flavor and the shrimp was very hard . instead of mexican food i would try the american since all the mexican food we had as a group was the same , nothing special .
mexican	our bill was under 20 dollars but somehow our food beat our drinks to the table and service was slowwwww
mexican	in fact , the 2 stars represent the value per dollars of the food . 4 stars for this place is insane . az people - you know better mex food !
mexican	food was ok . not worth returning to . it 's good for all the businesses around that area in what appears to be food desert . i just wouldn 't go out of your way to go there . the restaurant was clean and the people were nice .
mexican	and their burrito fell out twice ... worst chipotle experience ever
mexican	but nasty . dull flavors , beyond cheap ingredients . there 's veg fare to be gotten here , but so much better on almost every other corner in this part of town . kind of amazing to me that even tho they 're smack dab in the middle of burrito way that they continue to do business - hit maria 's around lunchtime and you 'll find the explanation : mostly gringos , slurping up the watered down salsa , ordering the 5 dollar lunch special and leaving 1 dollar tips . no , gracias .
mexican	the flour tortilla was dry and hard , the meat was overcooked in the carne asada burrito and the rice and beans were soggy and gross . i felt sick after eating here and i only obliged because j said he wants to relive his college days where he 'd eat there all the time . thankfully i didn 't die . felt like it for a few hours afterwards though . come here at your own risk .
mexican	in reality , the wait was 5 minutes . not sure the hostess ' know what they are doing . was seated , took 10 minutes for the waiter to show up . drinks were slow to arrive . pollo fundido arrived cold . waiter never asked how the food / everything was . drink refills were very slow / non-existent . manager never came by to touch-tables . overall , have had much better food and far better service elsewhere .
mexican	got there at 9 : 20pm and they were closed . i am very disappointed with that . i drove out of the way to get a crisp meat burrito and they were closed on a friday at 9 .
mexican	sat in the bar to watch the game and have a few appetizers . decor and atmosphere are very nice . service was okay . drinks were good . food was average . prices are ridiculously high for what you get . well over $ 40 for two drinks and one average chicken quesadilla ! could have gone to mercadito in red rock for the same money and had a much better culinary experience . sorry pancho , but i was hoping for better .
mexican	drove into an empty parking lot . that was a bad sign but decided to give it a try anyway . the restaurant was dark and the service was ok . i ordered camarones rancheros . the shrimp was overcooked ... rice and beans were ok ... overall not impressed . wont be coming back .
mexican	rushed over because i missed dinner due to work tonight . walked in at 9 : 56 to order a couple of tacos . the kitchen staff shook their head at me and said " no . " wow ! the seemingly floor manager also said " no we are closed . " the cashier apologized ( at least he wasn 't rude ) but also told me he couldn 't take my order . i questioned it being that it was before closing time . they assured me , " the kitchen already cleaned up . " won 't be back . that 's terrible customer service !
mexican	i was told i could not smoke on the lot . won 't be eating here again . in goodyear az
mexican	just to name a few ! guess you can make a living selling food to allwhitetukee that makes taco bell look like a five star restaurant ! pluses : atmosphere , chips , & ice . only good things in this place .
mexican	they claim this isn 't illegal , but is it really something a place like this should be doing ? they also say they don 't do this anymore , but i think it 's important for people to know that they used to . their fresh products are probably ok ... but pretty much everything in the freezer was expired and full of freezer burn . be an alert consumer , don 't buy expired food !
mexican	you may not be so quick to go there . food was great but if i catch salmonella it is hardly worth it . place reminds me of an outdoor cafe in mexico . even had the traditional loose dog in the dining area last time .
mexican	we ordered a pitcher of house margarita ( we were given and charged for the margarita verde $ 11 more - didn 't realize until after leaving ) chips and salsa , a quesadilla , and tacos . the bill was $ 99 - 4.7 cnf fee ( concession and franchise ) , $ 3 split plate fee ( x2 ! because my husband ate off of mine and my mother in law 's meals ) . absolutely ridiculous . for mediocre food at best and a crappy atmosphere .
mexican	this is the second time this location has messed up . i won 't be back .
mexican	it never fails . every time i go i receive an incorrect order . food is good . bring your patience if going through drive-thru when cashier asks to hold on a minute . a minute carries over to 3 just to take an order
mexican	i went through the drive thru and got my order . i usually check it before i leave to make sure i got everything i paid for . this time i didn 't and of course , they forgot two of my items i ordered . and they didn 't even give me my receipt so i couldn 't prove to them what i ordered and paid for ! ! !
mexican	how hard is it to make an order right ? i asked for no meat on 2 mexican pizza substitute it with beans . what did i get ? fucken meat no beans ! my order said no fucken meat ! and fast food restaurants want $ 15 an hour ? how about you first start making customers orders right ! the one on south jones and 215 is better then this place .
mexican	our waiter jamal creatively added a larger tip than written in . i 've been going there for years but never had such terrible service ( wrong drink , slow service ) and i 've never had fraud committed from cadillac ranch . i treated him kindly as did my lunch companions and am ashamed to have suggested this place for lunch .
mexican	you can 't look into the to go containers and of course it was all wrong .
mexican	too bad the food is awful - beans , cheese , tortilla - how hard is that ? ( and expensive for what you get , too ! ) better choice : a $ 5 banana & water fountain sip . pass .
mexican	cheese never melted , service sucks .. its close thats why i would go there .... so i went for a carne asada quesadilla .. so it looked like they threw the meat in the middle of the quesadilla like it didnt matter all the meat thrown in the middle for 8 bucks it better be good .... nooooo ... so fuck them i got my money back and never went back they didnt offer to fix it or anything .. melt your cheeses filibertos wtf that dosent taste good .your carne is dry nd skimpy ....
mexican	not cheese , cheese sauce . burnt carne asada and pink carne asada in the same burrito . they couldn 't even make my daughter 's quesadilla properly . this place is to be avoided .
mexican	very little meat in taco , which did not taste good to me . i was very disappointed
mexican	i unfortunately had to come back and edit my review for the unfortunate reason that they are simply cheaping out on the amount of shwarama meat they use . the taste of there toppings and ingredients are still fresh and delicious , but ive encountered this problem now on 3 separate occasions and sadly to say i will not be going back . the shwarma is essentially all vegetables with a very very small amount of meat , even when ordering there " large " options . there are plenty better options in oakville for shwarma for this very unfortunate downfall .
mexican	food was mediocre at best . they charged $ .75 for some hot sauce that at least gave some kind of flavor to the food . $ 85 for dinner for two with two margaritas and an appetizer . better off eating somewhere else for that price . waitress was more interested in bs ing with the folks at another table than taking care of us . very disappointed . no wonder lake las vegas is a ghost town !
mexican	now they suck . menu sucks . options suck . food sucks . if you want authentic mexican food don 't go here . might as well eat at home i make better mexican food and it 's authentic . only reason i give two stars is because my drink was good .
mexican	the spice really overwhelms any other flavors and the meats were low quality .
mexican	each tacos is $ 2.75 they don 't put lots of meat . i ordered 2 tacos and made it a combo . the beans tasted like they were out of can and rice didn 't have any flavor . they both looked like they served half spoon of each into the plate . beans and rice are cheap ! ! why charge $ 2.99 a side overpriced for that quality . the beef burritos were a reasonable size and portion for the price $ 6.50 each . they gave us two small salsa for + $ 20 of food we had to ask for more ! i would probably go back for a burrito but that about it .
mexican	chicken bone in my burrito and charged me for guac when i didnt get beans or rice because im diabetic .
mexican	we were so excited to see a restaurant in this location but food was a disappointment . i hope they make some changes .
mexican	salsa is cheap / watery / no flavor . it 's a fast food style restaurant even though the prices are the same as a sit down . definitely would not recommend to anyone i know .
mexican	the chips were odd tasting and the salsa was very spicy . the staff was very nice and there was a guy playing techno mexican music .
mexican	at least shred it so it looks real . felt rushed to leave even though there were several open tables . probably will not return for another visit .
mexican	i would highly recommend not eating here . it 's the taco bell of southern food and hospitality .
mexican	tostada bowl was disgusting . black and brown avocado and an uncooked jalapeno topped ot off . pineapple salsa looked like it was expired . threw the thing away as it was take out . never going back .
mexican	service was ok , sangria was good . won 't be back .
mexican	quoted one price and got to the window to get another price . asked for a receipt and the man at the window got angry with me .
mexican	chicken taco came in a fried taco shell that was stale ; lengua tasted like frozen roast beef .
mexican	the asada tacos were very fatty . the lengua were ok . we did order a quesadilla which was delicious . place is open 24 hrs and is clean so thats a plus . but food didnt impress . prices were fair .
mexican	beef taco was ok . veggie burrito was ok . salsa could be better . gigantic burrito was not very good . probably won 't be back again .
mexican	also , there was a roach climbing up the wall halfway through lunch which pretty much ended it for me .
mexican	entres were lukewarm . apppetizers were incosistent . pork shoulder was cooked at too high a temp and not long enough , stringy and dry . beans were not cooked long enough . fire alarm went off twice during meal and slow service with attitude . carnitas tacos were ok . terrible experience , pretty much ruined our dinner , look elsewhere for good mexican .
mexican	chicken was not cooked all the way , and the food was mediocre at best ... would not recommend .
mexican	the pupusas were claimed to be their specialty , but were mostly cheese . the black bean rice and bean dip both were really good . decor and ambiance are minimal . service was slow . but they did seem to have a steady stream of customers . not busy , but not empty either . i doubt we will return here .
mexican	chips were nice and warm , salsa was just okay . service was good i will give it 2 stars .
mexican	we got the half chicken meal and the chicken was too dry . it seemed like everything is pre made and it heated up in the microwave . fresh food is better .
mexican	chicken " works " giant burrito. lots of beans but not enough chicken. hochata is decent .
mexican	the sides were mashed potatoes and almost raw zucchini slices . i don 't think i will give this place a visit anytime soon because quite frankly , i can make the chiles en nogada for 4 people with that price .
mexican	carne asada was good but not worth $ 16.00 dos bottles $ 5.00 and * * * $ 10.00 * * * for a mexicali mule ? no bueno . cute place but overpriced big time ... i don 't mind paying for awesome food but this was more like arriba 's quality . well , not that bad , but you get the point . original visit 1 / 4 / 14
mexican	it was soggy , and had no flavor . big disappointment .
mexican	probably only good thing is the unlimited chips but even those are so-so . last time i 'm coming here
mexican	tacos had total of one teaspoon of beef in them . if your looking for meat filled food , don 't go here ... they use all fillers yet charge the prices of what you 'd expect to get in good quality food . don 't waste your hard earned money at this place .
mexican	the fries were amazing but the 7 other dishes were nothing special . bone marrow was ok but nothing special , both pasta dishes were too salty . meh .
mexican	they have a restaurant environment like no other and everyone i know raves about how awesome their food is . to be honest , i thought their food was very mediocre . creativity does not count more than food quality . immediately after leaving the restaurant i had a horrible stomach ache . then i farted for a good 12 hours in response to the food . no bueno . i got the jerk and jade red chicken it wasn 't all that people are saying . mediocre . if you want mexican food , go to a mexican restaurant. if you want chinese food go to a chinese restaurant. not worth checking out the fusion .
mexican	there is always a 10-15 minute wait . the people who work here are friendly and the food is good , but there is always a long wait and no parking .
mexican	not this one . i waited in line . let others go first . then i watched as the server contaminated a flour tortilla into 3 different containers . i asked for other due to a gluten allergy . he didn 't understand . the manager came over and asked to let others be served first . in other cities i haven 't gotten gluten once . i have 3 times here . done eating there . 3 months of suffering after inadvertently eating gluten is enough .
mexican	we 've had good experience with other locations , but this one is repeatedly clueless when it comes to gluten free . their staff is incompetent when you even say the word gluten free because they 've never heard of the term or can 't understand . they have lost our frequent business forever . we love their food , but not if i can 't get them to prepare it in accordance to what they say they can do .
mexican	boring with below average food . i really wanted to like this place .
mexican	dry meat , bland flavors , probably won 't visit again even though i live close .
mexican	great shrimp . guacamole ok , salsa ok , margaritas ok bloody mary blah.service was great and parking was good .
mexican	never any lines to worry about here ! horrible . the place smelled like a three inch road trip inside the lower colon of sick deer . every employee with whom i spoke had apparently awoken on the wrong side of the bed . not a smile to be found . and my lettuce was rotten , wilted and brown . that is inexcusable in a restaurant , and surprising to encounter at a national franchise . who 's in charge here ? makes me wonder whether the meat is beyond its expiration date too . stick with the guys whose door is propped open with customers waiting to get in . an empty restaurant like qdoba speaks for itself .
mexican	their portions are cut in half . sorry to see this . won 't visit another .
mexican	the rice was undercooked , and the guacamole was disgusting . the avocados weren 't ripe so that caused the guacamole to be hard and chunky .
mexican	big portions quality ingredients for a fair price . guacamole is very good and should be because it 's extra . i think of chipotle as the in-n-out of mexican fast food . 4 stars ! however why i gave 2 stars is because of the problem with my steak burrito i always order . specifically the steak . multiple times there have been way to many chewy grizzly pieces . it ruins the meal . i would expect one maybe two but every other bite is not ok . maybe it 's just this location but it happens a lot . enough where i don 't go as much because i don 't want to risk another problem .
mexican	chipotle is always a solid stop for a quick cheap dinner , but lets not confuse that for an amazing place .
mexican	the hype is overrated and every time i eat there the meat seems to have been sitting for awhile and i always get the end of the pan . its nothing special . i love mexican food , the real deal , and you can definitely find it in phoenix for the same price or even less as chipotle so why bother . the only thing i give them credit on is their whole approach to organic ingredients as well as quality meat . otherwise salsitas is where ill be for my " fast food " mexican fix .
mexican	the employees move like snails . none of them look like they have any sense of urgency ( even with a decent sized line ) . if i were their manager i would have some serious questions of my staffs work ethic . i personally avoid this location after many attempts for redemption of my opinion .
mexican	sometimes tortillas , sometimes brown rice , sometimes fajita veggies , but always something . great location though , and always busy . ( thus always being out of stuff ! )
american	" i decided to give salad and go a try . i had the mixed greens with apple wrap with chicken . it was amazing.so many flavors that i wouldn 't think to mix , but they 're awesome together . that salad is all i want to eat now ! my friend got the greek salad and that was delicious too . everything tastes very fresh too . i see myself picking up lunch or dinner here a lot from now on .
american	the food here is delicious . the presentation of the food is a whole other story , it is incredibly intricate with however they garnish it , whether its edible flowers , icing sugar , or syrups . it can get pretty busy but it is definitely worth trying if you 're ever in toronto , the prices are fair . i would recommend coming here for breakfast or brunch ! overall a lovely environment
american	i must day , it was worth the wait . the chicken sandwich that i had was had a pesto-mayo that was fantastic , and the chicken itself was cooked perfectly . wash it down with an ice cold beer and you 've got the makings for a good sunday afternoon .
american	i was working , so i ordered pickup . i got sweet potato fries instead of regular ... and they were the ish ! customer service was excellent as well . high energetic place which it seemed , the little time i was inside of course . i told them that it was my first time , so they put all of their sauces in my bag to try as well . they were all great . scottsdale was a little out the way for me , but i will definitely be making my way up their again for this burger . they won me over , easily .
american	if you are familiar with the valley cafe , i 'd say the selection is comparable but a lot tastier and the seating arrangement / interior style is similarly homey . the gravy is done right , it 's delicious and not spicy , which is what i wanted . their biscuits are cooked to perfection . i got the country chicken skillet and the chicken fried chicken was possibly the best i ever had ! the staff if so friendly and it 's the kind of place where you can strike up a conversation with strangers because it attracts that kind of clientele . i 'm glad i came here and i 'll be back .
american	the food was excellent and the service exceptional ! the only reason i 'm giving them a four-star was due to religious flyers posted around the restaurant regarding the meaning of independence day that were completely inappropriate and incorrect .
american	sure new york has plenty of great alternatives , but nothing is a replacement for in-n-out . there 's not much to say about this particular location ... except its nice and close to the airport and the two times i went there was almost no line ( which i 've never experienced in ca ) . vegetarians : order a " grilled cheese animal style " and some fries and you 're set !
american	one night we decided to check out this place and from the minute we walked in , we had a blast . they had karaoke and pitchers of beer , also peanut shells all over the floor like at texas roadhouse. the people were all super friendly and after a few drinks , i almost convinced my bf to sing karaoke . maybe next time ; ) we 'll def be back asap ! ; )
american	i guess in vegas anything is possible . for a total of $ 5.40 i got their country fried chicken steak with two eggs , hash browns , and toast . i usually eat alot and this number fills me up everytime and it 's available 24hrs . why eat fast food breakfasts when you can eat here for hand prepared high quality food and its cheap ? and the good part is the servers don 't prefer a tip , must be new policy or something , but thats fine , it just means my cheap bum a * * can keep saving money so i can keep eating here . thanks longhorn , you are my new lifeline !
american	( i 'm still searching for decent bbq . ) anyway , my man and i finally tried the original hamburger works . you like big , juicy burgers ? a choice of white , wheat , or onion buns ? would you like a " salad wagon " with all the condiments you can pile on ? ! of course you would ! and if you don 't then just go eat at in & out burger where you don 't get any choices . blech ! there 's lots of big , comfortable booth seating , the prices are reasonable , and portions are large . they 'd get 5 stars if their staff were a little more professional and courteous .
american	the owners and staff are true examples of southern hospitality , and the food is to die for . their fried chicken is amazing , collard greens are heavenly ( only second-best to my mother 's ) , and without-a-doubt the best cornbread you 'll ever eat . the only thing you don 't want is their barbecue ( its really not at all like traditional nc barbecue ) . prices are reasonable and there 's rarely a wait . ambiance is kind of like a dive , but everything is clean . if you 've never been you must go !
american	thank you indian village for filling a 4-year old craving ! ! ! the frybread was delicious and crispy with minimal oil ( considering that it is fried in oil ) . it was served nicely hot and fresh with powered sugar and honey . delish ! ! !
american	the food was great and the service , especially billie behind the counter , was fantastic . the jalapeño mac-n-cheese had a great kick to it ! i would give a 5 star , however i feel as if the prices are high for what you get . we will definitely bring our friends and family from illinois to enjoy some tom 's bbq .
american	i can 't say enough about pearl the hostess she is always so pleasant and cheerful , all the staff is great ! ! ! but enjoy when we get kyron , brinkley who is a sweetheart and also deanna .. the food is always great .... and the managers always stop by to be sure everything it to our satisfaction ....
american	then we stumbled upon this location . food stood up to what i remembered . if you 're looking for the best most filling breakfast out there , i 'd recommend the apple pancake . it 's less of a pancake and more of an apple pie . the flavors are incredible and you will undoubtedly have leftovers . now if you 're not looking for dessert for breakfast , my go to ate the 49ers . very thin , chewy pancakes . amazing . beware of the wait on weekends . you 're usually looking at 30-60 minutes on average , and usually greater than that sunday after church .
american	cheap sandwiches , lots of options , great personal vibe . may not have all the new fangled options you can expect at scottsdale shops , but who cares . these are great sandwiches at great prices !
american	great meat that truly gets bbq 'd ! delicious sauce ! try it the next time you visit c-u !
american	well just last weekend i finally made it there . this place is everything you 'd want in a breakfast diner . the smell of grease , awesome service and delicious food . no , this isn 't gonna be michelin star type food but it is going to do the job and give you what you 'd expect from a breakfast . meat , eggs , toast and nicely crispy potatoes . all for $ 7.95 including tea or coffee . for the price you can 't go wrong .
american	one of the best places in the city by far because of its amazing food , but more importantly , its amazing service . as montrealers , we have admittedly high standards ( we 've been so spoiled with great cuisine for so long ) . nuit social would fit perfectly in the montreal scene . do yourself a favour and give it a try ! also , the ribs are out of this world . tess is cool too .
american	i have 2 cars and had the smog and registration done here for both . the service is really great and friendly . lots of guys working the counter at all times . they make it super easy , but mind you it is not cheap . it is different for all cars and terms . with one of my cars i felt the price was too high and i said so . the guy i worked with made some changes to the rate and i was happier . be sure to ask about pricing before you make up your mind . dmv is cheaper but so much more hassle .
american	it 's nice and cozy and had a lot of things to choose from for breakfast , brunch or lunch ! i 've been trying out different iced lattes and coffees and all have been great ! the sandwiches are made after you order so nothing is just put in a microwave . the pasta salad is great , too ! ! my husband ordered it once and i ended up devouring it . nice sized portions . has both indoor and outdoor seating , which is great because i don 't like to leave my little pooch at home !
american	the location is shiny and new with friendly staff in a huge space . food was good as usual and they have a fancy soda selector machine . unfortunately , they do not have a soft serve machine which i have come to consider a dickey 's staple . hopefully this location will add it soon !
american	it tastes just like the original ! we have been long time fans and could not wait for them to open down the street ! this location is beautiful and the food is just as great of quality and taste . still hands down the best brisket i 've ever had ! ! it 's going to be hard not to eat here every day with it being so close !
american	it was an outstanding place for brunch . we enjoyed the mix on the menu . the fried green tomatoes with grits and roasted red pepper and fresh basil was a great twist on these southern staples . the kids menu went beyond the usual offering and their food was devoured . a shout out to our waiter william who was great with the kids and took wonderful care of us . i can 't wait to return !
american	not only the food , our server adam was great ! he was jovial and set a fun mood at the table ! totally recommend ! try the mini macs btw .
american	i had never been there before so i asked the waitress for recommendations and she had suggested the angus beef or pastrami . i had turkey on my mind so i ordered the turkey sandwich and my husband had the angus beef . when we got the sandwiches both of them were overstuffed with the meat , french fries , cole slaw and tomatoes . i asked for my sandwich with no tomatoes and the coleslaw on the side and a side of ranch . the sandwiches came in fresh italian bread and with lots of napkins . the sandwiches were definitely something to experience and very filling .
american	love the location in the newly renovated linq area between flamingo and linq . the menu is very versatile and suits many types of diets . we are pescatarian so it was great to have many seafood and vegetarian options . they have a place on their menu dedicated to vegatians that also uses meat alternatives . the macaroni and cheese with truffle oil was incredible . everything we 've eaten here was worth writing about . upstairs is a great seating option . our only complaint was the hostess wasn 't very accommodating to us having a child , we felt like we had to find a seat ourselves that worked .
american	great service , reliable quality and relaxed atmosphere make this a great place to get a good meal any time of the day . i 've tried many different drinks and dishes and i have yet to have anything less than satisfying . great prices make everything even more delicious ! i recommend the milkshakes , deep fried pickles and mac & cheese .
american	chief among favorites is the shrimp & grits and meatloaf . pleasant surroundings , nice staff and perhaps the most beautiful building in little italy . go ! we know you 'll love it !
american	food is always delicious . servers are always personable , well informed and attentive . take your friends . take your family . from drinks to dessert everyone will be happy .
american	paymon 's is a good choice for a healthy lunch . the service was very good and the food quality was too . sometimes during lunch hours they can get busy but i 've never waited more than 5 minutes . i always order grape leaves , tabuli salad to share and a cup of lentils for myself . this go around i went with the chicken kabob which can take 15-20 mins to cook but didn 't seem to very long ( maybe because they weren 't completely packed . i 've heard the athen fries are awesome i 'll have to come back and try them !
american	we spilit the smoked chicken and black bean quesadilla , browned well . the gala apple and maytag bleu cheese salad . she had the bbq lamb cobb salad . i had the pork tenderloin pressed sandwich with his southwestern fries . everything was awesome . top notch .
american	walked right in and was able to sit at the bar . i ordered oj and the basic 2 eggs , toast , delicious thick bacon and the best home fries ..... they are awesome rosemary white potatoes with onions . the only draw back is the place is small so it 's a little noisy ..... but very popular !
american	order my 7oz sirloin and sweet potatoes . my sweet potatoes wasn 't satisfying as other times i 've been here but this time it was pretty soggy / watery ehhh but i still ate it because i was craving for yummy food instead of my dieting food haha . my sirloin came out really delicious i was pretty happy and enjoyed it ! overall my meal was pretty tasty and delicious but wish my sweet potatoes wasn 't all soggy / watery . great place !
american	few things in life are predictably awesome , and brunch here is one of those things . i can conservatively estimate that i 've eating my favourite food item on their menu over 200 times , the breakfast butty . it is the one food that actually dream about , and when i get my fix it puts the world back in order and all is well . i also love the small diner feel and knowing that i just have to say , " i 'll have the usual " and my hot coffee and butty arrive perfect every time .
american	that aside , the food is very good i really enjoyed the chicken salad po boy and sweet potato chips . the salmon is to die for . my husband loves the jambalaya and gumbo .
american	and i was very happy that i did ! i could honestly care less about the decor , as for me it has no affect on the taste of my food . this time i ordered the brisket tacos , and a side of mac & cheese ( again ) . hot damn if that wasn 't some surprisingly good brisket ! ! my only complaint would be the sauce that it was topped with was a little too peppery for my taste . although i 'm sure next time if i asked i could sub the sauce for a different one . they also really improved on the mac & cheese .. so i guess maybe my first visit was on an off day .
american	i was very pleased i was able to order it this time , and even more excited when it arrived to the table . my over easy eggs were cooked perfectly so i could dip those highly addictive batter bites ( kinda like tater tots ) in my runny yolk . the hash ( note : the corned beef hash is not fresh , it 's the canned kine which i have no problem with as long as it 's cooked properly ) was super ono ! nice & crispy , just the way i like it . this is now my go to breakfast spot ! hooray for second chances ! ! !
american	as soon as we sat down a server came over to take our order , she 's been around a million times since and the uniforms make it way easier to spot them ! thanks for listening ... we 'll be back !
american	i had the arugula salad with chicken . a bit pricey for a $ 15 lunch salad and there wasn 't enough chicken to leave me satisfied . very tasty and very healthy , just not enough chicken . ambiance is unique for vegas . we are definitly getting cooler as a city when places like this open up . i plan on eating here a few more times so i cantry some of the other items on the menu !
american	i ordered the mushroom ravioli & wow it was delicious ! ! ! ! it was hot and each bite was filled with so much flavor. the environment was beautiful as well . very impressed .
american	i went there for a friend 's birthday and we got to sit in the beer garden . it was a nice escape from the usual madison outdoor eating experience . despite the fly population , i thought the food was top notch . i got the smothered and covered fried chicken . let 's just say the description fit the bill . that chicken was smothered and covered in delicious gluttony . i 'm a creature of habit , so it will be tough for me to get something else the next time i go , but i hear the burgers are the bees-knees as well .
american	our server , william , was very friendly and helped me make my decision to have the chilean sea bass . my dining companion had scallops and we shared the two . the scallops were good , i 'd have liked to see a bit more sear on them as well as seasoning . the sea bass was perfectly cooked and the sauce very tasty . potatoes served with it were just okay but there was enough going on that it was all enjoyable . we had dessert and i wish we had chosen the meringue because the sticky toffee we ordered was nothing special , the best part of which was the berry sauce . overall an experience which makes me want to come back again .
american	sure it was still a bit pricey for breakfast but the food was fresh , delicious and plentiful . though i no longer live in vegas , i had to get back to hh during my last trip and will always make a stop here on any subsequent visits to vegas .
american	i have tried the : club - great chicken sandwich ( you get a whole chicken thigh ! ) with bacon , flat top chicken - similar sandwich but with a cool cucumber dressing , holy schnitz - a monster sized pork schnitzel . all of them are great ! ! !
american	both of my subsequent visits had excellently attentive and friendly service , and we tried different sandwiches both times , all of them delicious ( granted , it is heavy food , but you don 't go looking for a grilled cheese restaurant if you 're trying to keep your diet for the night ) . glad that i gave them another chance , and now i would certainly recommend them .
american	just a phone call back from them was more than enough . nice to know that people cared . i returned this evening , but did not take them up on the free meal , as i felt it wasn 't necessary and am always skeptical of specially treatment . i sat at the bar and had wonderful service along with amazing food and drinks . i would suggest this spot to anyone , as they have a little bit of everything you could want on the menu and the friendliest staff . you have my business !
american	the chicken asiago sandwich with caramelized onions and 7 grain salad really hit the spot . as always their draft beer selection has a healthy mix of micro brews with a local focus . unfortunately i didn 't get the stellar service of smokin ' hot bryenne , but bridget ( i think her name was ) did an outstanding job as well .
american	a very sincere apology was made along with a promise to investigate the reason for food leaving their restaurant that not only didn 't meet my standards , but the standards of the restaurant itself . the very next day i was contacted by the manager of the 83rd and union hills restaurant . he too , apologized sincerely and asked that i give them another chance . i also received a refund for my meal . this was not asked for or expected , but it was very much appreciated . because of my experience at other locations and mostly because of the very professional and sincere way nypd handled this situation ... they 've earned back my business !
american	i am super impressed with their customer service , kudos for working to make this right . i was given a gift card and asked to give them another chancem which i did . the service was much improved , a gluten free menu was brought immediately when requested , i was allowed to order all the items on the menu , not just a couple selections , the server ( and everyone who helped tend to us ) - all very friendly and upbeat . the food was tasty and overall this was a much better experience .
american	this mesa location is 1,000 times better than the las vegas location . wow what a difference good local management makes ! who ever is doing the hiring here , keep up the great work ! every employee was friendly professional and attentive . i had the victoria 's filet with all you can eat fried shrimp which was excellent ! great tasting steak and good shrimp ! refills on the soda were prompt and without asking . great job mesa ! !
american	i ordered the exact same breakfast and it was delicious . the cheese was melted inside the omelet , the avocados were fresh , they remembered the pico de gallo and the eggs weren 't rubber . my husband 's meal was very good as well so we were happy . i wanted to come back onto yelp and give a new review and thank first watch for asking me back . keep up the good work !
american	it was worth it . the pretzels were hot and delicious ; and they made a special vegetarian sample platter that was pretty impressive . we couldn 't even finish it . i will definitely go back .
american	a manager from the restaurant contacted me via email and they were truly concerned and apologetic about the service i received . that to me says a lot about the integrity of a business . they truly care not only about delivering a superb product , but making sure that every customers experience is equally as superb ! they definitely deserve 5 stars ! ! the food is excellent and there customer service is top notch and genuine . anyone who has not eaten there definitely should , they are awesome and deserve your business and it is the best breakfast place in las vegas ! !
american	the manager emailed me and offered to make it right with a free meal . i 've made it my personal policy to never take a discount or anything free when it comes to restaurant food or service issues . i think it 's a nice offer but i want my thoughts to be free of that influence . i stopped in a week ago and have to admit that the service and food had changed dramatically . my steak was lean and delicious , the staff was much more on top of giving world class service . i 'm glad they have stepped up to the challenge . we will be back again .
american	then a friend suggested caffe centro as her go-to pancake emporium of choice . so , girding my loins , i set off and was rewarded with the best pancakes yet . i only wish they had more variety of batter and toppings . but this is an italian cafe and not ihop so that can be forgiven . they also do a mutha * quack * ing breakfast calzone . i will be back for you breakfast calzone !
american	finally had the chance to return with my friend who was with me the day we had bad service . we had a great server ( christy ) and the food was much better . thank you for the chance to come back and have a good experience .
american	she listened to our story , was extremely kind and understanding , and invited us back out . i was hesitant , but am glad we returned . i 'm not sure if the drunk server we first witnessed is still employed here , but we haven 't seen her , and the service has definitely improved . we 've been back a few times now since then , and the service has always been attentive , and of course the food amazing . i don 't know if they had just one bad egg working that day , but glad southside is back up to par ! love coming here late night after work for some incredible food .
american	my sister ordered the chorizo burrito , it was so delicious i can 't stop thinking about it . i will definitely be back . & i gave the chicken and waffles another try and they actually were much better . the service was perfect and we were served very quickly .
american	i appreciated the effort taken by brenda to hear me out and try to rectify the issue . a few months later , i went back to the buffet and had a fantastic dinner . the entire facility is beautiful and classy from top to bottom , there are so many options and stations to choose from , and the food is superb . i initially wanted to compare this to caesar 's bacchanal buffet but i find it difficult to choose between the two , so i 'm going to say that they 're bacchanal buffet and the buffet are 1a and 1b . they 're both great and you can 't go wrong with either .
american	they assured me that they were concerned with my experience and wanted to make it right . i returned last night with a gift card provided months ago and was pleasantly surprised . we were seated and provided a cold drink immediately . the food was great . my steak was perfect . the dessert was heavenly . the waitress was wonderful ... super attentive and friendly . the manager was visibly present and involved within the restaurant . great job !
american	so i just call them and place my orders . my family really enjoys their pizzas , typically the last few weeks we 've been ordering once a week . the one thing that i don 't like is the way the pizza is cut . while they do have a pretty large menu , i 've also tried their chicken alfredo , which l would recommend as well . i and happy to have a local establishment that delivers in my neighborhood .
american	after my review i haven 't signed on to yelp for a very long time only to notice that chef / owner had personally wrote me a sincere message regarding my experience , and although i have not yet returned to monarch ( since its closed in the summer ) i 'm truly touched by the thoughtfulness and gesture of owner / chef to make the overall experience better .
american	mcdonalds . after getting into an altercation in the parking lot with a 70 year old woman about how it 's not proper to cut in the drive thru line , we ordered our 10 doubles and a few other meals and went home . burger after burger they were cooked to perfection . seven burgers later i felt stuffed . i felt like sh * * for the next two days . i think that they poisoned my food . i give it 4 stars .
american	these pain killers have me hungry as fuck so after i was dropped off at home , no less than three hours later i drove my neutered ass to five guys . the cheeseburgers are good , the milkshakes are good , the fries are good and they allow you to have free peanuts which is if you don 't have a peanut allergy ... good . i 've been here like three times and never leave all pissed off and stuff . if you eat cow meat , eat their cow meat but put cheese on it and maybe some other condiments so you can spice it up a bit .
american	i 'm a big fan of classic places that have lots of nostalgia . this one fit the bill perfectly . the wife and i split a couple 64oz scorpions while i had munch 's breakfast and she had a blt . all 14 people there loved the food and nobody was able to eat their entire plate . we retired to the lounge for a mai tai or two and had a great time . best of all , my dad said it was just how he remembered it from over 30 years ago . i 'd return in a heartbeat .
american	i 'm glad i listened . gina 's was excellent . the menu was simple , which is a good thing . they stay right within the parameters of traditional diner fare . the quality of the breakfast food was top notch . the home fries were from real boiled potatoes . they 'll even make them with onions if you want . the sausage links were high quality . and the prices are cheap , especially if you order one of the breakfast specials that comes with coffee or juice . the waitresses are a little chatty , but in a good way . if your looking for a high quality , reasonably priced breakfast on the west side , give gina 's a try !
american	these sandwiches are truly some of the most flavorful i 've ever had . presentation is awesome , great variety of healthy options here and a lot of fun side / dessert items . i did feel the pricing for the sandwiches is a little high as they aren 't large sandwiches , but you pay nearly $ 7 for them . i can get a foot long at subway for $ 5 , but the taste of the sandwiches makes up for the cost and are probably proportionate portion sizes for what we should all eat for a sandwich . you will enjoy !
american	the service was great , quick , knowledgeable bartender / server and amazing food . had the french dip brisket and fries which was delicious the whole way through and great portions . the brady hot and sweet sauce is a must have . the scottsdale location is a nice small joint with quick service and great food and beer specials . highly recommend for lunch and happy hour .
american	coming from someone who doesn 't like burgers , i love shake shack . the burgers are a little on the smaller side , but good beef , great bun burger and just the right amount of sauce . also , the frozen custard is great . definitely get some if you 're in vegas !
american	she was absolutely delightful , pleasant and actually understood the concept of customer service . there was also another cheerful male employee singing in the kitchen while cleaning when we pulled up to the window . we are glad dairy queen failed so hard tonight because it brought us to making a more solid choice with you guys . thank you for the positive vibes and proper customer care .
american	i mean jared took such good care of the 8 hungry women that came barreling into the place . it took all of 30 mins tops to get our food and that is from the time we walked in , sat down and ordered . thank goodness as i am not sure we could have taken any more restaurant disappointments . eggs , bacon , coffee , hashbrowns , pancakes . what more can you ask for ? fast , piping hot , cooked just right . score ! thank you , thank you , thank you ! especially to jared ! you rock buddy !
american	though she was unable to determine for the bouncer how many drinks she had had , she was able to promptly order a giant mcflurry and use her debit to pay for it and have me eat half of it , also a cheeseburger . she may have tried to start a fight with a group of teens i can 't really remember . everyone at mcdonald 's is so nice . i feel like i have made life long friends . i also slipped on ice outside here one time and that was pretty embarrassing .
american	this one seemed a little more low-key than the others , but the food was fantastic . the garlic fries are always a must have and they made them perfectly well here . i decided to order the cajun pasta , which had shrimp , sausage , and chicken and it was one of the best pastas i 've ever had . service was pretty good and overall , it was a great experience .
american	i always take the " special " 2 eggs " tournés , " bacon and brown toast . the waitresses are quick with the coffee and the dish arrives in seconds . the place is pretty busy but i don 't feel rushed to finish the newspaper .
american	lots of food , good service , value in pricing . had the 1 / 2 meat skillet with protein pancakes ... solid !
american	so i when grind at " i love burgers . " brah , the burgers broke the mouth . kinda pricey but not bad . i woulda rated this place a 4 or maybe 3.5 on the burgers alone . faka was mean ! but extra points was cuz , my server jenny was on point . she can tell we were hungry already and was right there when we was ready to order . plus , kinda nice to be greeted with a friendly smile once you stay in your seats . so ... to make a long story short , i went for burgers , would go back for service by jenny . and , once again , faka mean !
american	the incident that drove me to this was thinking there was someway that taco bell 's waffle taco could actually work on some level . please don 't let the fact that i 'm an idiot detract from the next part of the review . pesto prima cafe was a solid improvement at a fair price . their english muffin with fried egg , canadian ham , tomato , cheese and basil aioli pesto was well constructed , hot , tasty and the default coffee that came with it better than 2 / 3 of the usual breakfast places but not stand out great . friendly staff , clean and i hope to get a chance to get a lunch there in the near future
american	the fish is great and the fries are even better . each time i 've been there hasn 't been anyone else here but i don 't know why ! it 's great food . a really cool atmosphere and decor .
american	this place has a big variety of breakfast and ( not only ) food . everything is very tasty and you can still eat healthy if you want to . their brisket is wonderful . the service is very fast and friendly . the place is nicely decorated , and it slightly looks like a train station of the 19th century . if it wasn 't for a table of little mexican kids yelling and screaming all over the place without their parents and stuff saying something to them it would have been an amazing experience . 5 stars !
american	rest assured , plaka is still putting out one of the more underrated breakfasts in town . i usually go with a breakfast sandwhich with american fries . simple . delicious . a little greasy . it is the perfect meal after a late night but also won 't weigh you down for the rest of the day . service is fast , friendly and efficient . what more can you ask for ?
american	the food is very good , but watch your wallet - the price can add up quickly if you aren 't careful . get a shake or a dessert if it 's your first time to get the full experience , and of course the classic shake shack though the burger may seem small , it fills you up just the same as any other . there is a lot of seating inside and outside , and the arrangement is clearly set up for groups to enjoy together .
american	we went early this time ( 4 : 30 ) , still waited over an hour in line . but well worth it this time . everything except the kobe beef was delicious . wife had the lamb , kids went to town on the crab legs , i had prime rib , beef flank and sea bass all night . everything had flavor , except the kobe beef . much better selection than bacchanal . only gripe i have is kids have to pay full price ( 3 yrs old and older ) $ 48 for a 4 yr old is kinda ridiculous .
american	they contacted us immediately and had us come back in for a way better experience . great recovery guys !
american	i was pleasantly surprised that they had other bread options versus the first visit . i ordered my sandwich with rye bread . the marbled rye had a very good taste with the fresh eggs and homemade sausage . the potatoes did not have the salt they did previously . all in all , i am still impressed with the henhouse .
american	wow ! fast service friendly staff and glad i ordered the small omelet three eggs was enough to fill me . i saw the omelets others were ordering and they were six eggs big ! yikes to much food . they were delicious and the staff was fun and quick . it is in a hole in the wall but it is well worth the visit . the strip mall has some funny shops but it is safe . enjoy the food and leave with a full belly and safe some money from the strip food to gamble later with .
american	this time we went when it was busy , and sat at the bar. the bartender / server was so helpful and attentive , completely knew how to treat customers. the tomato soup was incredible and i have since recommended cpc to many of my friends. thanks dean !
american	wolfgang has never disappointed me at any of his locations . the food and service were both amazing . fresh baked crusty bread to start , calamari , octopus , spaghetti , and the chicken piccata were all delicious . service is perfect and friendly . i made reservations early to get a nice romantic table . this place can 't go wrong !
american	wolfgang has never disappointed our family at any of his locations . the food and service were both amazing . fresh baked crusty bread to start , calamari , pork chops , spaghetti , and the chicken piccata were all delicious . my husband even ate brussels sprouts and enjoyed them .
american	the first visit , i was impressed by the beer selection . it was wonderful and definitely lead to our second visit . the misses to me the first go around were the food and the noise level . the outdoor patio was also very dark . the lighting was better for the second visit , but i have yet to retry the food . i got the pizza but wasn 't impressed . just an odd flavor paring . the noise level wasn 't as bad this time , but that could have been because it wasn 't as busy and opening the doors also helped . can 't wait to get back for more good beer and great patio weather soon .
american	the sunday brunch menu looks delicious as well . the setting on the lake is classy but casual , and the staff is super friendly ( shout out to valerie ) .
american	there was only a few people around the bar area since it was just after noon . we were seated and the waitress tom our order . she was very friendly and sat a talked with us for a bit . we ordered burgers for lunch and there were cooked perfectly . there were several tv 's to view while eating and the rest of the staff was very friendly also . great meal at a great place to eat .
american	ugh nothing except i died and went to heaven ! i had the famous chicken and waffles which was everything , our waiter told us the chicken was brined for 27 hours then pressure cooked . my husband had the 77 elvis chocolate chip pancakes and it was pancakes with a side of extra , really great ! the service was excellent , efficient , and fast . yardbird really does show you southern hospitality . we will definitely be back on our next vegas trip !
american	ate here 3 days in a row because their burgers were that good . $ 3 for a delicious burger , you really can 't beat it ! their iced tea is a must try as well and only $ 1.75 ! ! tried their poutine for lunch one day and to be honest i 'm not too fond of it . the cheeses curds were felt very rubbery and i could hear eat bite like rubber rain boots rubbing against each other . but i still highly highly recommend getting their regular burger and you can enjoy it in their store ( if there 's room ) or at the park across the street !
american	it 's rare that we are on this side of town , so we just had to maximize the trip . we were sold immediately on the seafood gumbo after hearing the ingredients that go into a bowl of gumbo . omg , i haven 't tasted such delicious meaty gumbo for quite some time . the flavor was bold , there were shrimps , crab meat , crawfish meat , drumstick , sausages ... um um um ... definitely took me back to louisiana . this bowl of gumbo is as good as it gets . there is no competition , weeziana gumbo & more is the place for some delicious , decent-priced cajun food .
american	this was the red robin that we are used to eating at . the food was great and shelley was a fantastic server .
american	i am giving five stars because of the vogue burger . ordered it medium and it was served to my table the way i ordered it . this burger is in my top 3 as all time best .
american	what a night and day difference . while we 'd had to put up with snobby staff at valentino , the wait staff at delmonico was informed , helpful , friendly , and a lot of fun to interact with . and the food ! ! ! oh my word , our ribeye steak was so fabulous we couldn 't wait to try it again and went back the very next day for more of the same .
american	we decided on harvest and sat at a table outside . the service was impeccable , but not pretentious or overbearing . our food was outstanding - i had a pasta dish , my husband had the chicken and we split the seasonal mushrooms ( incredible ! ! ) . the portion sizes were just right and did i mention the food was outstanding ? ? i look forward to visiting again and trying some more of their offerings . the only reason i 'm not giving 5 stars is the lack of ' ambiance ' in their outdoor area .
american	both times my husband and i have been greeted by friendly hosts , given fast and attentive service , and had delicious food . our waitress this last time was so friendly , very helpful with the menu , and thorough in checking back , etc . we got the edamame appetizer and it was simply divine . add all this to the atmosphere , lively music , and overall ambience ... and i would say hands down this is the best restaurant in the tempe marketplace .
american	no fresher seafood that i 've tasted in az , and they have such a wonderful variety from lobster mac , fresh oysters , and great steampots . overall , what i love the most is the experience . it really feels like you leave gilbert for a bit and are transported to the coast . it 's a nice escape ! the owner chris was extremely warm and welcoming and made our anniversary celebration very special ! looking forward to coming back for the bloody mary bar , and spending some sundays watching football here ! don 't miss out some of the freshest seafood in the valley , we need to keep places like this in business !
american	glad we did . owners debbie and jerry made us feel like we were at home . chef eric came out to meet and check on us , our service was great , and the food again was fantastic . we 're a tough crowd to please , but they found every way to do so . take time to stop by look check out the homey , living room environment of their party rooms , or stop by for dinner any day of the week . you 'll be glad you did .
american	we used yelp and found this place had almost 50 reviews and 4.5 stars . wow ! decided to try it and i know why they have such success with their reviews . the staff was helpful with ordering and suggestive on dishes and very friendly . the hummus was one of the best i had ever and the chicken kabob was flavorful , juicy and delicious ! we had a party of 6 and everyone loved what they ordered , even the kids . we wanted to eat it the next day again !
american	we have enjoyed breakfast al fresco , soup ( delicious and can be delivered ! ) and an exceptional chicken parmesan dinner . a trifecta- friendly service , great food and comfortable atmosphere . a hidden treasure-thumbs up !
american	thanks girls for the good talk while we waited for a table . devin 's great service alone is what can keep tables full here . ryan our server was pretty good say well . he made sure that our drinks where filled . the food was amazing ! i can for sure say we will be back . at the end of our meal it was get to meet carrie the owner or manager . she was one of the sweetest down to earth owners i have ever met ! thanks guys !
american	was it worth the drive ? so so , if you 're in the area . the good : the kale salad was fresh & tasty . the chicken was perfectly seasoned & fried ( not overly greasy ) . the sweet potatoes were just right . the coke slaw wasn 't too mayo-eee & had a nice acidity to it from the vinegar . the average : the french fries were a little to salty for my taste but luckily the beer helped wash down the saltiness . overall i would come back if i was in the mood for some fried chicken .
american	i 've got to say this has got to be one of the best food places to cure any kind of hangover . seriously , you need to order the potato pancakes ... their servings are just right to fill you up !
american	almost a 5 star but had problems w burgers cooked too rare more than once . everything else on menu delish ! macaroni and cheese bites yummm
american	the environment inside is wonderful and the wait staff was very friendly . my wife got salmon and i got shrimp scampi . food was pretty good , although i 've had better . overall i would definitely come back . the happy hour menu seemed good and like i said , the environment is very relaxing .
american	the decor is absolutely adorable ! my friend ordered the cinnamon sugar french toast and i got the cornerstone scramble . both of us really enjoyed our food and finished our plates . i really wish i could give this place 4.5 stars instead of 5 , but they lose a star for incredibly slow service . everything else was really good . will surely be back for lunch !
american	i couldn 't have been more pleased with my experience . the don 't take reservations on weekends but we arrived at 8pm with a group of 5 and were seated immediately . the atmosphere and decor was fun , the restaurant was clean , and the waitress was very friendly . i ordered the carbonara chicken burger with grilled chicken breast , bacon , mushrooms , sweet pea aioli , fried egg , and provolone cheese . this was the juiciest and most flavorful chicken burger that i have ever eaten . they have countless beer choices and my friend ordered the drunken monkey shake and it was also delicious . i highly recommend this restaurant !
american	this is not the greasy diner i would have expected , the food is fresh and has lots of flavor . the menu has more options than most places and the food is mostly from local sources and taste very fresh . we had a scramble and an omelet both were veggie and they were great . the vegetables in both tasted and looked very fresh . both plates had a good portion of food and left us both full . the coffee was also good , it is a light roast and smooth .
american	i ordered the fried pork chops , black eyed pees , and collard greens to go . the corn bread ( comes with every order i believe ) excellent as well . everything was delicious and affordable . very large portions enough for left overs if needed . the manger was very helpful and extremely nice . i will definitely be making my way back here ! !
american	i was extremely hesitant because good wings in vegas are rare and most places don 't cook them right i got a 6 piece mild w / bbq & my bf got a 9 piece lemon pepper hot . i was pleasantly surprised the wings were great ! ! ! fried perfectly and the sauces were really good too . the only reason why i had to minus one star was for pricing . i thought they were a little on the expensive side compared to other wing places . i will be returning ! !
american	it was my husband 's birthday . we were greeted at the door by a very nice waiter jamal . i must say that it truly was an awesome experience from the drinks and food to the very personable staff . it was kathy the bartenders birthday too so she came to the table to wish hubby happy birthday and jamal was so great . we will definitely go back again and hope to make this place our new neighborhood place to go . the only bad thing is the hundreds of martini choices ! not really a bad thing . settled on the antioxidant martini . delicious !
american	had a margherita pizza as an appetizer , it was okay . nothing more . will skip that next time . but being from nyc it 's also hard for me to be impressed by any other pizza ! my boyfriend ordered penne diavolo , had a great flavor . i had shrimp primavera it was great . dessert was the best ! chocolate mousse cheesecake , it was the first time i ever considered ordering a second dessert ! will definitely return . service was great , cody was on the ball . noise level was pretty high .
american	figured the parking lot is always packed so they must be doing something right . this place has a chili 's type vibe and layout . it can get pretty packed on weeknights but there 's quite a bit of room so the wait isn 't all that long . they offer a lot of different dishes and have both lunch and dinner specials daily . the both times i 've visited here for dinner the service was very good and the meals were plentiful . have yet to go here for lunch and put that 's a venture for next time .
american	got th italian stallion sandwich on dutch crunch bread . very tasty ! i 'll be back !
american	i ordered the three cheese ravioli since that 's what people seemed to reccomend the most . got two orders , one for my boyfriend and one for myself . the cashier forgot the second one so manager comped it for us super sweet man who definitely made sure we were satisfied with our meal . the food was great so we decided to also try the carrot cake which was also good . i would definitely come back in the near future .
american	the reviews were really favorable so we thought we 'd give it a try . we were not disappointed ! the cheesesteak sandwiches were great and the garlic parmesan fries were the best garlic fries we ever had . they will customize your sandwiches any way you want and the staff there is extremely friendly . word of mouth goes a long way and this place has earned it .
american	one skillet meal , one denver omelette , and a philly cheese steak , l hit the spot . quick service was also very good . the karaoke was very entertaining too . would go back again next time for sure .
american	a friend and i stopped in and had the 1 / 2 lb burger and fries for $ 2.95 ! ! ! ! the burger was big , juicey , well cooked , and unbeatably priced . we also had an order of the wings , they were so so . two beers ( one of which was a $ 7 sierra nevada ) , two burgers and and order of wings set us back $ 20 . i highly recomend stopping in sometime for a quick after work meal .
american	they don 't take reservations but we were able to get a table for 4 on a sunday around 12pm for brunch . the service is friendly and efficient and the food is delicious and well seasoned . i ordered the eggs your way and the rest of my family ordered crepes . all of our dishes were lovely , especially my eggs and home fries , so tasty . their mimosa and coffee are also really good , coffee was nice and strong . i will definitely come back when i visit toronto again .
american	i took a look at what my fellow yelpers had rated high , and nearby . harlow 's cafe came back loud and clear ! my mom had the super sized , ultra delicious belgian waffle . it of course came with butter and maple syrup . as for myself , i went with the regular stack ( 5 ) buttermilk pancakes . these hotcakes were easily 1 " thick if not more ! i always come prepared with a monster appetite , but sadly , i was defeated by the flapjacks in this semi eating challenge . to sum it all up . the meals were both giant and delicious , the bill total was under $ 20 , and we left the cafe happy campers .
american	none of us were trying to spend a lot of money , and we all appreciated that the lunch menu had " $ 9 and under " right in the front . with that being said , they had a good amount of food choices including healthy smoothies and vegan / gluten free options , which was nice . when we got our food , none of us were disappointed with the taste . the place was open , spacious and very comfortable , which was great .
american	the staff were delightful , the food was very good , and the prix fixe was pretty broad and a great value . everyone of the eight of us at the table commented on how great everything was and how we will all be back !
american	hunger ensued and i looked for the closest place possible . so glad to have found this place . the decor is nice- with lots of seating in various styles ( bar tables , dinner tables , booths and couches ) . they pretty much had an arrangement for whatever crowd and whatever event . lots and lots of tv 's . their menu is not the most extensive but it did have variety 's of the same items- which makes sense . i had the burger and it was decent . my bun was cold which i dont prefer but other than that the portion , presentation and taste was great . this place is a hidden gem .
american	we were excited that we could get some good food and play some pool , darts or cornhole . the food was pretty good and the service was great . we spent several hours at baileys and really had a great time . i look forward to coming back !
american	i gave a detailed account of everything and they were apologetic and anxious to make it right . although i vowed to never go back to this particular location , my son talked me into it because we were right next door . the service and food was excellent . the staff was attentive and the burgers were perfect ! we will definitely go back !
american	he invited my family and i back for a complimentary dinner . this time around we had a better experience : the food was great , and the waitress was attentive and kind . i am greatful that i had a chance to indulge in an awesome deep dish pizza . thank you evan for reaching out and assuring that our experience this time around was as perfect as possible .
american	i was super impressed with their management and will chalk my last experience up to the server having a bad day . thanks jayelynn and justus , you earned my business back !
american	she was very responsive and even asked my thoughts on things . this proves to me that i had a rare occurrence when i was there , as i thought may have been the case . big thumbs up to customer service and cory ! thank you for taking the time to respond . i look forward to my next visit there , i have been wanting more of that brisket and the bacon wrapped jalapenos !
american	the staff is welcoming and super attentive , the food is honest and delicious , and the airy atmosphere just exudes good energy and warmth . we managed to beat the rush on 1 / 1 but the place got really busy towards the end of our meal . get there , order les cantons ( which comes in a cast-iron skillet ) , order the fresh juice , and enjoy the rest of your day .
american	their sandwiches and salads and deserts are all excellent . i would have given them 5 stars but was very disappointed to find out that they no longer offer my favorite which was the thai chicken sandwich and salad with the peanut sauce . they totally did away with it . hopefully they will bring it back .
american	fast service , great food , excellent onion rings and thoroughly enjoyed the experience . will be back again soon . keep up the good work .
american	i 've only known shrimp and grits from new orleans where you can taste the freshness . but the white cheddar grits more than made up for it . the pork in the dish was a little too much . however , i rank this among some of the best shrimp and grits i 've ever had . this is probably the best restaurant in cornelius / mooresville / lake norman area .
american	we opted for a couple of breakfast specials : ham , eggs and toast , along with a latte . i have to say it was the best coffee i have had , ever ! unfortunately , i live in california and the morning commute for coffee just might be a little too much ! i 'd be at village coffee every day if i lived in scottsdale .
american	i was expecting a line as i have heard it get busy at 11 but we were seated quickly . if i had not been with someone who had been there before , i probably would have missed it as it is very unassuming . i had the smoked salmon eggs benedict and fresh juice . the hollandaise sauce is a little more acidic than at other places but works so well with the dill and salmon . perfect portion so you don 't feel too full after . i think i 've found a brunch staple .
american	but since i had been to bonefish in atlanta many years ago , i gave it a try a few months after it opened . i was pleasantly surprised . they completely remodeled the previous islands . the fish was fresh , tasty , and reasonably priced . service was at tentative . the house citrus vinegrette salad dressing was superb . definitely will be back .
american	we were pleasantly surprised at their menu and variety of options . it 's not a huge menu but they have something for mostly everyone . ( no vegan options that i found ) party of three and we had 2 appetizers , a burger , veggie burger , braised beef , and finished with their house made vanilla bean ice cream on top of their peach blueberry cobbler . all of the food was very good . their mac-n-cheese is stellar , the cobbler was amazing ( not too sweet ) and all of the dishes were hot , fresh , homemade , and tasty . we will definitely go back . highly recommend !
american	jade was our server ( we sat in the bar area ) , she was quick , friendly , approachable and attentive . so i wanted to drop in and write a review to offset some of the " bad service " reviews placed on here . the food hasn 't changed .. chicken gud .... and it 's even better when it 's wing tuesday ( can 't beat that price ! ) so with that , i gave the place 4 stars ! i 'm very stingy with my 5s : ) .
american	we came for brunch and had a great experience . our waiter henny ( that 's henny ) not henry , was phenomenal and honestly helped to elevate the experience to feel like we were in a much more expensive restaurant . we ordered the dessert trio and it was spectacular . we would return and request henny again , overall , a great meal in a very comfortable atmosphere . 5 stars .
american	the chicken tenders were moist and yummy . the mac n chz was melt in your mouth . jin ( spell ) was friendly and called us by our first name during our entire visit . i saw a few regulars come in and jin knew what they wanted.i found my new chicken finger place ...
american	the entire experience was just wonderful and i 'm glad i ignored these reviews ! i 've dined extensively in europe ... i know what good food is ! i thoroughly enjoyed the chicken and biscuit dumplings and was also able to sample the pork tenderloin . if you 're not a picky eater , you 'll certainly enjoy the yummy vegetables . collard greens and sweet potatoes ... doesn 't get any better ! we finished our meal with beignets ... almost as good as cafe du monde in new orleans ! plus , our waitress was a real gem and checked on us multiple times . we 'll be back !
american	well , like is an understatement . i loved this place . everything about it . the simple decor , to the fact that your sandwich is delivered in a paper wrapper . so simple , but sooo absolutely delicious . i tried the reuben and the crispy chicken sandwich . both delish , and the chips are yummy too ! you can tell that everything is so fresh . i can 't wait to go back and try something different !
american	the owner lucious was friendly , professional and even let me try some samples . today i went with the shrimp n grits and the bread pudding and they are delicious ! definitely will return ! !
american	not disappointed . the poblano poppers were delicious . each of 6 poppers is served in a shot glass with a creamy aioli sauce . great presentation and soooo good . i did not have a shake , as i opted for alcohol , but the other 3 people in my party did . again , great presentation and creamy , deliciousness . the burgers were tasty , made with high quality beef . the choices for types of meat and add-ons are plentiful . the margarita i had was one of the best i had in vegas ! friendly staff , great food . you gotta try it !
american	they have got the bugs out and it was a very nice experience . deanne the hostess was lovely , friendly and helpful in telling us about the place and the menu items . craig , our server was very helpful , attentive and couldn 't have been nicer . tea glasses were filled before completely empty . food was very tasty and presented very well . prices are not really bad . they are keeping with area . portions are large , we shared a bison burger and a house salad . i will be back again .
american	all the positive prior reviews were are absolutely correct . for a smaller establishment the seating is very amble as is the parking . for my first foray i decided to go with the classic gyro with side salad instead of fries . the gryo was so packed with quality meat that it was difficult to do justice to my salad . next time i 'll have them pack the salad to go . after all i needed to save room for dessert ... so i decided to order the baklava . without a doubt world class .... 5 stars . the greek bistro it 's going to be one of my favorite local restaurants .
american	came here midweek , and there was no wait . items ordered were : -american kobe beef with provolone -black angus beef with american and sprouts -skinny fries -hefeweizen everything was so good ! ! ! medium rare burgers were juicy and the fries crisp . the burgers were devoured literally within minutes . the bill came out to be about $ 40 .
american	we were seated very quickly and waited on just as fast . the staff was pleasant and helpful . our table was toward the rear where the bus boys waited to clear the next table . my wife was very uncomfortable with them standing over us . we changed seats to help with that . our food arrived very quickly and as stated the fried flounder my wife ordered was a lot of food for a small platter . it was a little too fishy tasting for her.my blackened mahi was very tasty but very small , good thing i stuffed myself on the hush puppies . knowing my wife we probably won 't be back .
american	we were seated in less than 5 minutes around noon on a busy sunday . our waitress visited our table immediately and was attentive during the entire meal . my food was above average and my wife said her meal was excellent . we will both return to this restaurant .
american	boy am i glad i did .... i had the south philly with grilled onions which is steak , mushrooms , bell peppers and of course whizzzz and let me say it was outstanding ! i think it may have weighed 10 pounds ! this will definitely be on my list as a return spot every time i 'm in town !
american	service was a bit slow but very friendly staff . had this months special the pimento burger ... cooked perfect to temp great burger . i 'll be back for sure !
american	the place was clean , the staff was very helpful and friendly and the food was delivered fast and delicious . i tried the steel city burger on a pretzel roll with onion straws and my friend had a regular smash with french fries . everything was fresh and amazing . will definitely visit again
american	first the house bread was delicious ! i ordered the lollipop ribeye was cooked perfect ! my girlfriend ordered the salmon and that was great as well. the only negative is the sides were nothing to special. but over all i was very satisfied ... good job old homestead !
american	so , we decided to try it today ! ! love , love , did i say love it ! i had something simple scramble eggs , ham and potatoes with the spicy a little sweet pesto sauce , was so good . i recommend this place to all . i can 't wait to go again , next time brunch .
american	also got all meats deep dish what can i say except i found my new joint . the only negative i would say is the it ruined pizza for me from other places . set the bar to high ! ! ! ! ! ! !
american	pizza was very good . the staff was extremely friendly . not a fancy place , just a great food and cold beer .
american	when the waitress delivered our meals my friends and i were very impressed by the presentation and portion sizes . the steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned . i wasn 't planning on clearing my entire plate but i couldn 't stop eating , everything was so delicious . we were also impressed by the service , the servers were very attentive and the bartender even delivered our drinks himself . we were so tempted to order the bread pudding for dessert but we were all so full . can 't wait to come back !
american	i ordered the works cheesesteak w / whiz and an order of chicken fingers with wasabi ranch and the siraicha sauce ( don 't think i spelled correct sorry ) . the cheesesteak was $ 12 and the fingers were $ 8 . neither came with fries , a bit disappointing . the chicken fingers are definitely hand cut and breaded and are more like 8 regular size fingers elsewhere . the sauce options are unique and were good . the cheesesteak was definitely better than most but seemed a bit shy on the wiz and the shrooms .
american	our table was ready and we were just on our way in so it worked out perfectly . the espresso drink options were delicious and everything that was ordered at our table didn 't let us down . it was all fantastic and i recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious breakfast with a great atmosphere . just be prepared and call ahead !
american	i ordered buttermilk pancakes with a side of potatoes and he ordered the chorizo omelette . we also ordered the cinnamon bun and the cinnamon lattes . everything was delicious . the sizes were generous and it wasn 't overpriced at all . it was about $ 30 for everything , which is awesome ! we will definitely come back here .
american	we arrived at around 10 : 40 , and i was really nervous about seating , but there was no line up , and we were seated right away ! the service was friendly , and attentive . i ordered the crepes , which was fantastic , and in my opinion tasted like having apple pie for breakfast ! my mother also really enjoyed her breakfast . the food came almost fifteen minutes after we ordered , which was incredibly fast ! it was perfect for a sunday brunch , and i would recommend it to my friends !
american	the food was scrumptious ! my sister had the short ribs which was so tender that she could cut it with a fork . we both had the sautéed spinach which complemented our entrees very well . my wild halibut was moist , flaky and very tasty cooked with cajun spices served with a delicious ratatouille . and , yes , brennan is a terrific waiter who recommended the special entrees and provided us with outstanding service with a smile !
american	went with a friend and we started with a side salad and the mussels ( which i generally don 't like btw ) . the wine and garlic sauce they were soaked in was so good i seriously contemplated licking the plate , and the mussels were nice and tender , not chewy or fishy- superb ! i then had the ragù bolognese for my main dish . not only was i practically too full to even touch it , but it was so rich ( esp. after the mussels ) that i didn 't want to . such a shame to end the meal on a downer , but would still go back - and highly recommend this place - anyother time .
american	and since i was staying in planet hollywood , it was the perfect opportunity ! true to the reviews , this place serves up big sandwiches for very good prices ( less than $ 10 ) . i got the tuna melt . oh man they stuck a huge chunk of gruyere in there and even got it to melt ! awesome ! i only finished half of it in one sitting . and it was still yummy 4 hours later . i came back the next morning for a muffin . you know this place is good since there is always a huge line out the door !
american	the food at touch supper club is out of this world ! ! my boyfriend and i went on a thursday , which is their gourmet taco night , he got 3 different tacos and i got the spicy peanut pizza . with having a severe fish allergy i am always worried about cross contamination and they keep their standards high when making sure there were no problems . the staff was wonderful ! service was beyond what i could have asked for and the food was out of this world ! i will be going back !
american	so i ordered two pepperoni pizzas and a bucket of fries ... and i gotta say the price was right , the fries were crispy and the pizza was awesome . way better than those large chain pizzas that are made 2go . other than that cashier being a little hard of hearing ( having to repeat myself over and over ) , the food was great . but they only get 4 stars because of lack of seating ... there were two round tables with two chairs at each one . a little constructive criticism would be to push back that cashier 's cage and put a few more tables .
american	while not the perfect place , the service was attentive and all of us enjoyed out unique dishes . the portions were large , ( with the exception of the meat dishes , which were huge ) but not crazy . enough for a little doggie back . we were celebrating my birthday and all of us ordered dessert ..... the mushroom bread pudding was once of the best things i 've ever had ! i will say that our dinner took about an hour to come out , which is redic. o 3.5 starts .
american	) it is very dark inside . weather was good so we chose to eat outside instead . i had the lamb and it was perfect . my date had the fish and his was great too . our server was very attentive and mid-dinner a woman came to check on us as well ( possibly the manager ? ) . i would love to come here again . one appetizer , two entrees and two drinks came out to $ 130 .
american	maybe we got lucky , but it was pretty good ! the service was terrible , but the food was delicious so for us it evened out . my husband and i shared a burger with fries and the nachos ( off the appetizer menu ) and he also had a beer , which might have been bigger ( like many have said ! ) if they had more than just bottles . we found that we needed more sour cream with the nachos and our waiter didn 't come around until we were pretty much finished with our meal . so , bottom line : go , and ask for and extras when you order so you don 't go without them .
american	my wife had the trout , i had the charcoutre and both were amazing . we were not altogether hungry when we sat down so we did not sample the starters but we did opt for the bread and butter which was a great choice . we were headed out for drinks to celebrate our anniversary after so we also opted out of dessert but i will be sure to try that next time cuz there will be a next time . it 's pricey but worth it .
american	oh my gastronomical goodness ! the pig dip is amazing ! best tip ? share it ! save room for dessert ! sticky toffee pudding ! the whole experience was delectable ! make reservations to come here the next time you are in the mood for some amazing food !
american	and i must say it was wonderful ! we were greeted with a smile at the hostess stand . we were seated in a booth that was surrounded by lovely decor . our server christian was kind , informative , and very attentive . i ordered the chicken and waffles . the chicken was moist and flavorful . the cornbread waffle was ok - not my favorite . my husband ordered the breakfast plate and enjoyed every bite . our favorite was the sweet caroline sweet potato casserole . they had somebody playing the keyboard which was nice not too overbearing as far as sound goes . i enjoyed brunch very much and look forward to trying their dinner menu in the near future .
american	this is now my second order in two weeks ! i ordered double cut , light sauce ... i 'm picky . these pizzas looked better than the commercials . the place was clean and the people were professional , courteous , and quick . they know what they 're doing . definitely my go to dinner place . thanks so much !
american	super , super friendly staff . i ordered the $ 5 burger , fries , and drink deal and couldn 't finish all of the burger or the fries . made fresh to order and piled with toppings , the burger was fantastic . loved the fries . the guy who took my order came to check on me during the meal to ensure i didn 't need anything else . it was a little warm in there , is my only complaint . i sat right in front of the fan but next time i might just take it to go or come on a cooler day . but i will go back . and did i mention how friendly they were ?
american	i was pleasantly surprised to be mistaken . it was a perfectly aimed bulls eye . my buddy and i enjoyed the foie grais sizzling on a hot rock ( if you like fg , this is a must ! ) , a lobster noodle dish , the rib eye , lamb pasta , brussel sprouts , mushrooms and fine wine . the service was impeccable and the decorum was chic as well as relaxing . while all was spot on , the desserts were the crowning achievement . we had the chocolate banana caramel mousse as well as a waiter special , dark chocolate peanut butter bars . i don 't make this statement lightly .... the dessert was the finest i 've ever had .
american	they definitely didn 't disappoint . our family all did the build-your-own option . the size was plentiful as we all had left overs ( which we plan to heat up for lunch tomorrow ) . a pizza and drink was about $ 10 , but considering that we will get two meals out of it , it 's a great value to us . it was walking distance from our hotel ( hilton suites ) so we didn 't have to deal with parking . but we saw plenty of parking on a sunday night . it 's a bit tricky to find as they are kind of tucked away behind the good egg and jimmy john 's .
american	i headed straight to mediterranean and enjoyed flavorful chicken curry ; dolmas and tabouli . next up seafood for a light seafood salad , peel n eat shrimp , & chilled snow crab . the tomato basil soup gets good marks . i was surprised to see heart of palms and marinated artichoke salad . the italian sausage was tasty . i had just enough room for my yummy bread pudding .
american	not many good places in the general area ... the philly was delicious and the crinkle cut fries were perfectly cooked .. not soggy at all ! reasonably priced and fairly quick .
american	he raved about his sandwich and we both loved the truffled tater tots , so yummy you don 't even need to dip them in anything ! i had the lobster club , i really enjoyed it , topped with avocado and bacon it tasted wonderful , i get full fast for i removed the middle layer of bread . the decor reminds me of an old school gentlemen 's club , deep wood tones and leather very rich feeling , pricing is about what you would find on the strip another plus real fresh squeezed orange juice yummy ! will be dining at the henry again for sure !
american	we had 4 in our group and they managed to mix up the sides . this would be a big issue , if the food was not good . i would hope that when i go back that the problems are sorted and the standards have been kept . i would advise you to avoid being seated in the bar area as the noise from the bar patrons is loud . we had a good server who reminded us about happy hour and saved us some dollars . not five but could be .
american	however , we decided to keep it and be our own critics and we 're so glad we did ! the atmosphere , food and service were superb ! you should expect to pay a little more when you have such a great dining experience . great food , stunning view and fabulous service ! as the saying goes , " you cannot always judge a book by it 's cover ! " we are definitely looking forward to our next visit
american	to find out that it was very good experience . staff was very knowledgeable and food came out faster than expected . the restaurant was packed . so we expected to be there awhile . our waiter alex was on it . never felt rushed and always brought us fresh drinks . some people shouldn 't write reviews . they should be reviewed first .
american	but i actually enjoyed this buffet . the concierge told us that there is usually an hour wait to come here . we waited about ten minutes . i like how there are several stations where they serve it to you , like the crepe station and the prime rib station . the dessert station was wonderful . i wished i could have had room to eat more .
american	after reading other yelp reviews on this place i decided to head down after work.true to what other yelpers gave stated , it is difficult to find.i decided to try the white pizza , which has no sauce and has garlic and ricotta cheese. chatted up the cute redhead cashier who 's name i did not catch ( hi , if you 're reading this ) and enjoyed my slice.the slice was greasy as hell and tasted good. it definitely is worth a repeat though .
american	i decided to go anyway since i was coming to aliante for a movie . i came for the sunday brunch & with your players card it only comes out to $ 11 . everything was outstanding ! not your typical bland buffet food . everything tastes fresh & full of flavor . top it off with all you can drink mimosas ! ! our waitress rikki always made sure our drinks were filled & plates cleared away . she always had a smile . bottom line , great food & outstanding service !
american	my kids love their pizza - so that was the same as the one on bell - and they were happy . my husband and i were both in the mood for a burger and i was shocked that this burger was so good ! big , juicy and very tasty ! we also got some wings to start and while i think their sauce choices are limitied - the wings are much meatier than the ones we get at west addison or temple . my favorite sandwich at the other amore is the toasted turkey sub - so i 'm anxious to come back and see if it is as good here .
american	i 'm glad i did . station street hotdogs is clean , bright , & cheerful . the staff were incredibly warm & friendly . the area is designed so that you can watch them toast the bun on a grill - yummy ! i did splurge on the duck fat fries . they were delicious - crispy & flavorful . my only complaint is the pricing for the " house dog " ( the only basic hotdog ) . i 'm not a fancy fixins kind of girl . i just want ketchup and a bit of onion - so $ 4.00 is quite expensive for that . i will definitely recommend this place and i 'll return .
american	i also had the leek soup , served cold , which was also good . i bet when eating it on a hot day , it would have been even more refreshing . also , the daily special meal for two deal looks amazing . it includes a 500ml glass of white or red wine ! their offerings include lamb shoulder , bouillabaisse , whole fish , etc . i was very tempted , would order that if i can find an accomplice . another plus for the restaurant is the open late policy . it closes at 2am on the weekends , 12am on weeknights , which is indeed helpful for those late nights !
american	were greeted as we entered , our server was very cheerful . the food was very good and received promptly .
american	i am so glad we did . our server was shana and she is awesome . the road kill was delicious as was my rib eye steak . the baked potato was the best i ever had . the music wasn 't too loud , and the place had a nice cowboy vibe . we will be back .
american	we were seated immediately and after placing our order our beverages were served quickly and our glasses were never half-empty ! colton provided excellent service and recommended the onion rings .... they were not greasy and were really good . we also ordered the french dip sandwich , the cuban sandwich and the margarita flatbread pizza . portions were good size and we took 3 boxes home . they offer a lot of different brews and have sports playing on several flat screen tv 's. we really enjoyed the atmosphere , their delicious food and excellent service ...... definitely will go back again !
american	this place lived up to the reviews and we will be back . staff was courteous , prompt , and the food was exceptional . nice outdoor seating area for awesome spring morning like today ... nice way to spend our last morning in town with family .
american	tastey ! ! ! i will be eating everything off this menu . i had brisket sandwich - insanely good bbq sauce . the mrs. ran the front and the mr. ran the back . phoenix needs more mom & pop joints . highly recommended .
american	i 'm a big fan of chili dogs and italian beef . first the people there were amazing and know what customer service is all about . the chili dog was great love the bun and the chili . the italian beef was so tender and with the peppers added some heat to it . i will definitely come back .
american	the chicken was very tasty , with crispy skin and moist while being cooked perfectly . i enjoyed the potato rounds but felt that the coleslaw had an odd flavor and the hush puppies were pretty bland . the staff was friendly and efficient and my order was placed and packaged in under five minutes . while i prefer nashville style hot chicken , i would return if i was in town for some good ole southern fried chicken !
american	we were greeted & after some confusion w / seating finally sat at a table . ten minutes passed before we were offered drinks : ( but after that service & food were amazing . great view ! loved watching the crew go by . nice trails to walk after a filling meal . food was worth the wait . great brunch ! i will be back !
american	a friend recommended this restaurant to me and i am so glad she did . first off we had dave who was beyond fantastic . we had someone who had a dairy intolerance and he customized our tasting menu for us . he was amazing and made our dining experience fantastic . the food was delicious ! each course was an amazing treat ! ! bart was our desert server and he was also great . all in all a fantastic and fun evening ! !
american	it was so good , it really should have been a dessert too . we also had the greek ( spinach was delicious ) and some melted cheddar with an omelet . the service was excellent , very attentive and timing was perfect . the decor was something that kept us looking for hidden dragonflies throughout the experience . highly recommend this little gem .
american	at long last we finally made it there . for our first time , we settled on appetizers . in total , we sampled six . my favorite is definitely tuna with heirloom tomatoes . the sweetness of tomatoes perfectly compliments smoked salty tuna . other appetizers were equally impressive . the service was extraordinary . our server was extremely friendly and very knowledgeable about wines . although the menu already contains the food and wine pairing , she took the time to take us through the wine list and make a suggestion that would satisfy variety of foods we ordered . we will be back for more !
american	we got a table right away considering it was crowded . our food came fast too and it was very good . i had the tom mix since i was craving corned beef hash and it was very good . the coffee was also good . it also had a very nostalgic feel and very quaint . we will definitely come back whenever we 're in town . staff was also very friendly .
american	there were items here that whole foods did not have - like organic celery . evidently monday is a busy day , so the parking lot was full , which was a hassle , so next time i will go on another day of the week , but i was told by the cashier , never on the weekend , its supposed to be a zoo on the weekend ! like arnold said in the terminator , " i 'll be back .... "
american	when we arrived there was a long line but thankfully they served delicious bloody mary 's . definitely worth getting one . when we sat down we ordered two entrees to share between 3 people . it was more than enough . we ordered an omelet and an eggs benedict . it was better than another brunch place in vegas but not the best i 've had . i would come back but i can 't give it 5 stars . coffee wasn 't good by the way .
american	very friendly service and made to order omelette that was great ! cheap too with half off coupon and players card discount !
american	i ate on two separate nights and enjoyed good food and service each time . everything was reasonably priced and the menu was fairly diverse . if you 're looking for a good meal at a decent price i 'd reccomend it .
american	so glad i did . got here around 9am as not many other options that early . breakfast paratha special , masala dosa , idli , pao bhaji everything was great . service was quick . amira was super friendly . and their masala chai is a must have ! ! !
american	upon arrival , i was met by bbq master , james . he shared with me his secret for great q , but i 'm sworn to secrecy . i ordered the 3 meat combo with ribs , brisket , link , with greens , mac , and sauce on the side . everything was delicious ! ! perhaps the best ribs to touch my lips . the greens were perfectly cooked , and the mac was creamy deliciousness . i shall return ! !
american	we went on a wednesday morning , so there was no waiting for a table . the decor reminded us of places you would find in the beach resort areas , which we enjoyed . the menu is extensive and it was hard to decide on what to order . i did order the chile verde omelet which was very tasty . we sat at the table that had guy fieri 's autographed poster / photgraph mounted on the wall above it . overall , our pre-tip amount was about $ 45 , for four breakfast meals was a bit pricey even for food this good . we would eat here again but not make special trip here just for eating here .
american	the decor and atmosphere is fantastic . long table with outlets for your laptop , books , magazines , games , etc . huge bonus points for the dog station thingy out front - two water bowls and hooks for the leashes . the staff / baristas were very friendly . the prices were extremely reasonable . i had an iced peppermint white mocha , which was absolutely delicious . this is definitely an ideal coffee shop and place where you can chill for several hours .
american	5church did not disappoint ! i booked a table for my birthday dinner , and we loved it . everyone at the restaurant really made me feel special for going there to celebrate my birthday . there was no forced " happy birthday " sung to an uncomfortable table . instead we had great dessert and excited smiles . the menu was divine . you won 't find the same thing here you 'll find everywhere else , and it 's so refreshing ! the creative food combinations were not at all pretentious like you 'll find at some places . the atmosphere is fun , inviting and unique . great for a date , party , or happy hour . can 't wait to return !
american	i wasn 't in the mood for a full fry up but thankfully they have some nice alternative choices . i opted for the mahi mahi salad . it was lightly dressed and full of good ingredients like kale , wheat berry , rice , barley , beans , broccoli , cucumber and tomato . the fish was nicely grilled and still moist . not a huge portion of fish but , along with the salad , was more than satisfying for a lunch time meal . next time i 'll have a fry up as it looked amazing . cute decor with limited seating , clean establishment . friendly service . well worth a visit when you 're in the area .
american	this place was hidden away in planet hollywood . i had the club sandwich and the wife had the chipolte chicken . both were very good and made well and were perfectly toasted . can 't say much about the service because you just give your order and then they call you when food was done . if you have chance to go to vegas . give this place a try . nice thing is that it is open 24 / 7 .
american	the husband and i set out to find a nice happy hour locale for our weekly date night and were not disappointed with presidio . bartender , chad , was super nice and attentive without being over-bearing , he kept us refreshed and let us order drinks at the happy hour price a few minutes after 7 . atmosphere is nice , and we love the open doors and patio . we haven 't tried the food but are returning this evening if that says anything .
american	lobster is my single most favorite food and the lobster pot pie is one of my favorites there . service is expected from a michael minas , very good and they do their job in making you feel special . be prepared to spend money because that is the kind of restuarant you are going to but if you are a foodie , you will be happy with your experience and food . i haven 't had one thing there i didn 't enjoy eating and they provide modern twists to dishes also which i appreciate. mmm getting hungry thinking about it !
american	ordered the chicken sandwich which is very crispy but not as moist and tasty as chick-fil-a which hasn 't made it to las vegas and may not given their religious beliefs . the fries and shake were ok . staff was a little spacey on monday morning .
american	service was awesome and food was even better . i had the oatmeal with fruit which in some restaurants is instant but not here . fully cooked with cream , maple syrup and other fruits . highly recommend this location . it was very busy yet service was excellent and food was served quickly .
american	luckily i am one that loves petes ! from having a bit of salt on my fish to their " secret sauce . " while i can understand how some might not find their food appealing , it hits my taste buds just right ! i would say its worth a try , if you have never had it before . worst case you get something in your belly . best case you have a new place that you love to visit !
american	i tried one of the vegetarian plates . spinach pie , hummus & falafel , and a greek salad on the side . very very good . the spinach pie and the greek salad yum yum . this is a great little place , i will be back every time i come to town . the price is right , and good food . nice family owned restaurant , give them a try , you won 't regret it .
american	our experience was very good . we were seated quickly and the rest of the wait staff was very friendly and attentive . we had fish and chips and a blt sandwich with ham . both entrees were well prepared and tasted great . we enjoyed the setting and view . we can recommend this restaurant for anyone making a drive up to mount charleston .
american	but nonetheless we were helping a school fundraiser . i ordered the quesadilla burger medium and got a medium . and juicy quesadilla burger . it was really good . hot and fresh . the only it needed was some salsa and it would be a 5 star . the waitress was attentive , and the manager did come over towards the end to check on us .
american	good thing i listened to the local . the food was rockin and plentiful . i ordered a 6 " deep dish and side salad for lunch . i could only finish half of both . the pizza was , let me see- awesome ! the service was on point so i am guessing the other reviewers just caught them on an off day .... give em another try the food is worth it . the only wierd thing was the booths were unusually small so grab a table if at all possible .
american	we originally chose another restaurant for brunch , but people were lined up outside so we decided to pass . when we checked in at another broken egg cafe we were told there would be a 20 minutes wait . since that would probably be our wait time anywhere , we decided to stay . it turns out we had to wait less than 10 minutes . both my meal and my husband 's were delicious . the portions were generous . our server kept our coffee cup full . i did think it was a little pricey for brunch at $ 33 without tip , but that is what you would pay anywhere in southpark .
american	we had been to e ' and bazaar in miami beach several times and knew the outstanding quality and flavors of a jose andrés restaurant so could jaleo really be a 3 + star restaurant ? the answer is absolutely not unless you compare it to e ' - which , of course is totally unfair since e ' is 7 to 8 times the cost and number of courses as jaleo . pleasantly surprising jaleo did share a couple of dishes from bazaar ( endive with citrus and chevre and gazpacho ) . the shrimp in olive oil with chilies and ginger and the hangar steak were outstanding . by far the best tasting option in vegas at an amazing price .
american	best burgers i have ever had and the parmesan garlic fries were delicious ! prices are competitive and not unreasonable . service was also fantastic . we will definitely be back ! !
american	took the risk and gave it a try . had a great steak dinner in a beautiful and cozy environment . the servers were very nice and helpful . i would definitely come back for the king prime rib .
american	our waiter , however prepped us ahead of time and explained that their portions were indeed smaller and that if we were really hungry , we should share an extra entree . while i think we could 've foregone the additional order , we were not disappointed at all . everything was top notch . the milkbread was delightful ( and was a good belly filler beforehand ) . the scallops , duck fat potatoes , yellowtail crudo , and pork arista were all delicious . clean plates all around and we were pleasantly full .
american	huge sandwiches , amazing mac salad , super yummy green beans ! the banana pudding was a bit fluffy but still amazing ! the owners are super nice too ! we will be going back : )
american	but i had a great experience at cafe hollander , and as long as you go in knowing it 's a belgian brewery type of place , you won 't be disappointed . first , the building is impressively large , the decor is intriguing , and the upstairs has tvs a plenty for game viewing . the beer list is extensive , and the food menu , which has a decent variety for a belgian brewery , proved to give us all a good , solid meal ( 4 different entrees ordered ) . i had the salmon , which despite a lackluster presentation ( but again , belgian brewery ! ) , was very good .
american	my boyfriend and i decided to go anyways . all i can say is , wow you people don 't know food if you left a negative remark ! our food was phenomenal . the service was phenomenal . no it isn 't a super fancy place , but the food is incredible and very reasonably priced . our $ 56 dinner was worth every penny . i had a special , he had ravioli 's and we split a desert . amazing little place that i will 100 % go to again .
american	yes its in an older area , but being a native to las vegas , there is nothing to be afraid of here . i found the people there friendly and super helpful . we recieved some fun tips on the meat we purchased .... which was delicious ... beautiful bone in ribeye , some brats , and killer bacon . so yummy !
american	i 'm glad i did ... i had the caramel and chocolate waffles with a order of pork belly . the waffle was fire ! cooked to perfection . and the pork belly ! ! ! i thought i was in the south . this will be in my vegas rotation .
american	at first from outside i thought i was at the wrong place but nope ! inside it 's a gem ! it is a little bit small but it feels cozy and homie . food was good and fresh . they make their french toast with hawaiian bread ! i say , if you ever around you should definitely try this place !
american	you were right , the chicken tenders were amazing , not sure how to describe how crispy they were and how tender ... the sweet potatoes fries were excellent too and the sauce was yummy ! even the lemonade wasn 't too tart or too sweet . for 11.95 i got three large tenders , a large lemonade and two regular orders of sweet potato fries which were large size to me . it 's located right near the casino inside the luxor .
american	we went on a sunday morning and i was surprised at how quickly we got sat ( there were multiple people waiting outside in front of us but we still only had to wait ~ 10 mins ) . service and food was very fast . i had a mini veggie omelette and hash browns which were amazing . the coffee was also excellent . my husband got the corned beef hash . he said it was average but could tell it was canned and not homemade . all in all it was a good place , but we are still in search of some good homemade corned beef hash !
american	it was my first time coming here with the boyfriend and man were we hungry . first and foremost ! order two pounds of the crawfish . if you order one , you 'll be really sad . like we were . let the crustaceans sit in the juices for a while ! you 'll be really sad if you don 't ! and make sure you stick to mild if you like spice but not too much ! because mild is crazy spicy ! like , my nose is running and my lips are on fire spicy . other than that , service was quick and amazing and the fried calamari was thebomb.com
american	since it was breakfast and we were starving and this was the closest food to our room we just decided to give it a try . i am so glad we did . ordered the veggie burger , hash browns and club sandwich . all 3 of us loved our food . it was delicious and a decent price . i recommend to anyone who is looking for casual sit down place with yummy cafe food . also , the decor was quite beautiful and each table felt like a little private dining area in the room we sat in . you must try the 2000 island dressing also . delish .
american	after trying wicked spoon on my last vegas trip the bar was set pretty high . bacchanal made wicked spoon like a shack . the sheer size of this place is amazing . i would for sure check out the build your own taco station as well as the seafood section . price is a little on the high side but the meal was well worth it . will be back again soon !
american	once i entered that restaurant , the aroma of the place was mouth watering . i ordered a number 2 combo which is one choice of meat with two sides . i ordered pull pork with mac and cheese and thick slice fries . the pull pork was cooked to perfection , mac and cheese was awesome . i definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to try a great barbecue .
american	from the bright decor to the delicious food to the amazing service ( i mean everyone who works there actually looks like they enjoy their job and are having a good time ! ) this place is 5 star . i love the cozy lounge feel and could easily see myself enjoying several hours of delicious cocktails and conversation with friends . this would be a great spot for dinner , drinks , or even an event ( another yelp event please ! ) . highlights : tasty drink menu fabulous wicker tables and trendy ikeaish style great part of town sexy servers ... dang impress someone : take them to fez !
american	we ordered the smoked chicken wings , mac n cheese , and the corn bread . the mac n cheese was my fave ! the wings , were very flavorful and cooked just right ! but the corn bread seemed like it was missing something . but you did like how moist it was . i will definitely come back . there is still so much i want to try .
american	wow was i wrong ! the wait was totally worth it , and the food had a quality higher than any other pizza joint i have visited . i had the margherita , and i recommend it , though i heard the wiseguy is also amazing . all in all , if you can deal with the wait ( sometimes up to four and a half hours ! ) , you will be rewarded .
american	the atmosphere is great and the food was phenomenal . the libertine burger was probably one of the best burgers i 've ever had . the food came relatively quick and the service was awesome ( especially our server , karen ) . definitely deserves all the great reviews it currently has .
american	the coffee was delicious , fresh and hot . the pancakes were really fluffy and tasty especially with the home made apple butter and jam . the chorizo omelet was the best i have ever had and the biscuits were amazing ! just the right side were the very delicious potatoes . the benedict was a bit disappointing since it was canned hash but the biscuits and gravy made up for it . will we go back ? absolutely ! !
american	we were seeing the beatles love show later that night , so we got a discount on the buffet . we were pleasantly surprised though by the quality of the food . we mainly stuck to the things that looked appetizing and didn 't bother trying anything else . things i would recommend : -the all you can drink wine ( included for free ) -prime rib ( honestly , the best we had out of all the vegas buffets ) -bbq ribs ( we preferred them even over the ones at bacchanal ) -salmon handrolls ( sushi ) -gelato ( chocolate , pistachio , mint chocolate chip , and vanilla ) overall , the buffet is nothing fancy , but it has a few stellar options !
american	i was totally pleased with my food . i had the squash ravioli - it was superb . i also had a house salad that was nice and fresh and had just the right amounts of everything . the place was pretty noisy , but i don 't think there is anything that can be done about that . all in all i have no hesitation recommending this restaurant and i will definitely be going back .
american	i 've been here 4 times now and had excellent service and excellent food by people who actually care about what they serve in this restaurant . we have tried many different things and never been unhappy with anything . give this place a try you will truly enjoy it even though there are other restaurants around this rib and burger place this place is excellent ! every time we 've been here we 've enjoyed the patio outside ... what is better in vegas great food and great scenery !
american	i came here , and it was great . i started with the $ 2 side salad . it wasn 't the best but okay ... good size but mostly just iceberg lettuce , though . nothing special . however , the buffalo chicken flatbread was great and also a great deal for $ 6 ! oh yeah , as advertised , all the drinks are really cheap , too !
american	the hummus is great . my gyros was good . service was fast and efficient for lunch .
american	once the bars close on any friday or saturday night , there 's a line out the door . the pesto chicken pizza is amazing ( i 've had it while sober too ) . other people i know are loyal to the potato skin pizza - slices of potato , melted cheddar cheese , bacon- you get the idea . whether you just want basic cheese and pepperoni or something with a little more pizazz , slices is sure to have something for everyone .
american	the breakfast crowd was gone and there was only 1 other large party seated . we both ordered the raspberry swirl french toast . it was very good and the portion was huge . we also got a small order of the doughnuts which were hot and delicious . the place is very cute and the service was very good . i will be going back and trying lunch next time .
american	the food is incredible . i love the pierogies and blintzes are to die for . this is seriously good food .
american	i am happy to say that we did not have the same experience . service was friendly and professional and food was delivered promptly , correctly and it tasted great .
american	the watterson was excellent , the dry rub cajun wings were great , my wife 's grilled buffalo chicken salad got eaten very fast , and my son couldn 't finish the chef salad it was so big . the staff , nicole and alyssa , were very attentive and kept our drinks full and the food coming . i would recommend this location , and i don 't usually do that . like i told nicole when i was there , as we discussed the yelp reviews , " sometimes you just have to have a watterson ! " so dang good .
american	let me assure you that there is nothing to worry about . the food is delicious , the drinks are on point , and the service is impeccable !
american	our server was so polite and gave us great service . our breakfasts ' arrived in a very timely manner and were excellent . i would definitely recommend the chandler egg & i to anyone ! ! ! !
american	i must say that the owners must have also read the reviews , bc they were falling all over themselves to make sure we were seated with menus promptly . very friendly , and bonus points for looking like dustin hoffman . the eggs benny ( i consider myself an avid eb eater ) were outstanding , with a hint of dill . i 'll be back .
american	the service was outstanding . friendly people were all over this place ready for anything . i ordered the potato rosemary pizza . good pizza isn 't rushed . why are people so impatient . the pizza was amazing . the atmosphere was inviting . i will definitely be going back . oh yeah . i forgot my card going out to my car , but the waitress tracked me down . the only thing i was thinking was how can i give them a bigger tip .
american	we where greeted by a very friendly wait person who quickly fixed up a table for the eight of us . our wait person was very friendly , and very attentive . we were all very happy with our breakfast items , which we chose from a large selection of offerings . the manager stopped by to make sure we were all happy and satisfied . it was a beautiful day and we sat outside without ever going inside , but i looked in the window as we left , and it was very small inside . it might be hard to get a seat inside on a cold or rainy day , but some of the tables were cove
american	my girlfriend and i went there last night and this place did not disappoint . hands down the best pizza and wings in olmsted falls ! on our way out we met the owner and it turns out that his mom was my sunday school teacher when i was a kid ( small world ) . the only reason for 4 / 5 stars was our server could use some training . she was a little inattentive , but we did get there close to closing time , and i think she may have been new ; i give her a week and she will be an all-star . all said and done , i can guarantee we will be headed back !
american	the experience was pretty fun over all . and yes , the food is pretty good . the way the food is set up does not make you feel like you are a one of those buffets where the food is just pilled up . everything is served in individually on plates or small bowls . the desert bar is amazing . they have all kinds of sweets , chocolate covered strawberries , cookies , cakes , pies , and ice cream . over all great place to have brunch . it is a little pricey on weekends , but well worth it .
american	from the taste of the food , its presentation , friendly efficient service ( no dish was discussed unless we asked a question ) , the experience was perfect . even the wine recommendation was spot on . from the gambas al ajillo to the bistec to the champinones and more , each dish was wonderful . just back from two trips ( montreal , miami ) pallantia far surpassed the other meals -- not that i wasn 't happy with my meals while traveling . i try not to complain -- i am always grateful that i am able to go out to dinner and experience a meal prepared for me -- but this meal was extra special . we look forward to returning soon !
american	as most reviewers have noted : the food is made to order , which is slow but fresh and worth the wait . another selling point was the conversation and general friendliness that the owner provided . one last thing ; the po 'boy was $ 18 but worth every cent . you could feed 3 people with that monster of a sandwich . if you 're in the neighborhood , take the time to stop in . you won 't find too many places like this anymore .
american	grumpys does a really good job on the basics . their pancakes , omelets and corned beef hash are delicious . but they 're also basic dishes that are not difficult to make . grumpy 's puts their own twist on them and they taste delicious . same with dinner . their soups are all made from scratch and healthy . their specials can be hit or miss , again i stick with down home dishes . the service is always personable and i always feel right at home when i walk in the door .
american	omg ! ! amazing . they par-bake the bread so when they cook it through the impinger - it tastes like it was freshly baked ! ! cheap too ! ! ! ! ! after losing most of our $ $ in vegas this was a great option !
american	as i found out , this place have the best sandwiches i ever tasted ! unfortunately , i only stayed here for 3 days and couldn 't possibly try the whole menu but when i come back , i 'll definitely try something different . besides from the buffets , i had sandwiches for 2 nights and had a little of my family 's as well . will be back in vegas but no lines at the time i went at night but long as line in the afternoon but service was quick . all in all , i was pleased with the sandwiches and bigger bonus of staying at this hotel makes it easier too ; )
american	it was the best ( and largest , by far ) reuben i have every had . seriously , my mouth is watering just thinking about it . our experience was fantastic and i fell in love with the casual feel of this neighborhood joint . service was great , ridiculously fast , and everyone was super friendly . this will definitely be a stop any time i visit cleveland .
american	i like that they greet everyone that walks in . nice touch that seems to be forgotten these days . i sat at the bar and mark quickly came over to introduce himself . asked if i was hungry and made a suggestion of the beef sliders . they were delicious . food was priced good and the beer was nice and cold . mark and alisha ( sp ? ) always checked to make sure i was taken care of . great local bar . also i think it 's cool that the owner actually reads these reviews and responds . that says a lot . keep up the good work ... i 'm hooked : )
american	overall , a great little diner in amidst a strip mall . it 's quaint , with great diner service and solid good food . they are well known for their popover bread , and you must get one when you eat there . great mom and pop joint away from the strip , and well worth the drive . i eat here at least once a week because i love their omelets .
american	we had beef and chicken shwarma , kebob , and 3 pies . everything was really good and very inexpensive . the pita sandwiches are $ 4 and the pies 69 cents each so everything including drinks was under $ 20 . while your there you have to check out the store . they have some awesome stuff for really good prices . i had to get some olive oil and lamb chops becuase i couldn 't pass up such a great deal and the meat looked very fresh .
american	right after work i called in to place my order . it took about 20 minutes for my order to be completed . i got the dinner combo a for two with cajun and swamp sauce wings . the wings were a good size and tasted delicious naked ! i also like how they weigh the wings to exactly what i ordered . the wedge fries were nothing special . i didn 't care because i was interested in eating their wings . the dinner combo was $ 28 and change . there is limited seating as they are more of a take-out shop . i 'll definitely be returning !
american	i ordered a hamburger combo . the was only one person working the whole place but he did it well . i have an homemade tasting burger , very good , lots of options for topping the fries were fresh cut and pretty good , i prefer thicker fries . i would definitely recommend this place for a great burger
american	i 'm so happy that i did . i had the nutella and banana french toast along with a side of their potatoes . i highly recommend both . the french toast 4 big slices of bread with nutella and bananas in the middle . the portion was a good size . the potatoes had carmelized chopped onions and red peppers . they were delicious . the service was good and the food was more than i expected . i 'm happy i gave this place a try !
american	i walked in and was greeted and seated outside . great service from the gentle man . there were a couple of workers that walked by and smiled but never said one word no hi or anything . food came and it was delicious . this is a good place for breakfast or lunch . overall pretty satisfied
american	i ordered the cheesy bacon french toast and my friend got the grilled cheese sandwich . the french taost bread was delicious , with crispy bacon on top and sooooooo much gooey cheese melted on top ( and covering every inch of it ) . the maple syrup comes on the side , which is a nice touch ( as i hate when my syrup touches my food ) . it came with a side warm arugula salad , which was delicious as well . my friend said the grilled cheese was delicious as well ! i will definitely be coming back to try the pancakes and the chicken and waffles ! ! !
american	service was exceptional , food was great ! ! ! many of us did the 4 course for $ 32 and i did not hear a complaint from anyone ! ! ! just before the entree 's came , my better half left the table to head to the restroom . when the waiter noticed she was not there , he grabbed a cover for her food and when he saw her heading to the table , he ran back and took the cover off before she got to the table ! ! ! does not get better than that ! ! i had the shrimp scampi on the four course deal , and was pleasantly surprised ! ! friday evening .
american	but it surprised me with great food . from our hummus plate & sweet potato tots to the steak and the finish with cheese cake . it was great . the only reason i dinged them a star was that the service was a little slow . waiting for drinks was a little annoying . otherwise the food was too notch !
american	stopped in for a quick bite to eat and a beer . staff was great very friendly especially christy . food was good you should try the california burger , cooked to perfection . i don 't know why everyone is complaining must be associated with the previous establishment . yes i ride , but i was welcomed with the same hospitality as everyone one else dressed in suits . keep up the good work .
american	but we decided to give it a try anyway . their biscuits and gravy were delicious . gravy was peppery and had chunks of sausage and the biscuits are huge . my mom tried the green chili chicken soup which was delicious also ! i see nothing wrong with this place . the staff was very friendly and the food was good .
american	it was fantastic with a side order of onion rings . i don 't understand the some of the low ratings . i will be back . want to try the fish and chips next time .
american	however , it was a pretty damn good sandwich , and the line moved quick ! my 2 pennies
american	i live nearby and pass it on a daily basis , and started hearing commercials on the radio . we decided to get 20 wings and zucchini fries to-go for my boyfriends birthday . i will say we were more than pleasantly surprised . the wings were juicy , crispy , and delicious . the zucchini fries were crispy and delicious as well . i love to support local businesses and this will definitely be our new spot for wings . we can 't wait to try other menu items . would also like to mention , the carolina panther decor was major bonus points in our book ! keep it up dunwright grill !
american	they have a few but they are the bomb the coffee is also delicious . highly recommended it to anybody .
american	it was every bit as good as the reviews rave . i am not even a huge caesar salad fan , but the salad here is so fresh and well prepared , i loved it ! all of our steaks were prepared exactly to our order , and my family of 4 split 4 sides , and it was hard to finish all of them . for dessert , the creme brulee is wonderful as well as the coffee drink with 8 different liquors . it is definitely on the pricy side , but i felt we got a lot of food , and it wasn 't outrageous for vegas prices .
american	no doubt about it , best subs that i 've had in montreal . great choices . great bread . phenomenal dressings ! one of us had a salad and said it was also really good . my new go to for subs on the west island .
american	i got the salmon with rice pilaf and i paid $ 1 to substitute the cole slaw for mixed vegetables . i also got the garlic butter for my salmon . it was delicious ! the salmon was cooked to my liking and the garlic butter was to die for . the rice pilaf and mixed veggies complimented the dish well too . i will definitely be returning to order the salmon again and to try the clam chowder served in a bread bowl . : )
american	my friends and i ordered the following : 1 . beer battered maui onion rings [ $ 9 ] 2 . roasted jalapeño poppers [ $ 12 ] 3 . " just fries " [ $ 8 ] 4 . chanterelle burger [ $ 16 ] 5 . hell 's kitchen burger [ $ 14 ] 6 . farm burger [ $ 15 ] if i had to choose one item from the list above i would choose the roasted jalapeño poppers ! the food and service was great but if you go during a busy time you 'll most likely end up waiting 30 + minutes before getting seated .
american	the customer service was awesome . the restaurant and atmosphere was awesome and five stars . as for the food , it is definitely affordable . my wife had the pork and mac and i had the buffalo chicken meatballs . the food was good . nothing i wouldn 't drive two hours to get like garrett 's popcorn or badger products . it was good food and it would make me return . very nice people !
american	it was one of our to-do items on our summer bucket list and i 'm so glad we went ! i ordered the veggie burger and twas perfect ! the patty was not dry at all and the bun was soft , but not too soft ! i usually don 't order fries , but this time , it was a choice i didn 't regret ! i finished every last fry : ) my friends ordered the cheddar burger and they loved their meals too ! just something to keep in mind : if you order water , they will give you bottled water which you will have to pay for ( $ 1.55 )
american	however , i 'm glad we went . food was good , service was good . we had a groupon for $ 65 - included surf & turf , dessert and two cocktails . without the groupon , i feel it would have been overpriced . we will return again .
american	we had gift certificates so didn 't want them to not get used . we were not disappointed ! the steaks were incredible , very tender with a yummy spice salt seasoning . baked potato was really good and the salads were good . only complaints were we made reservations but that didn 't seem to matter as we waited as long as people that walked up . our waiter was very nice and helpful however service is really slow .
american	it was beautiful out , so we sat on the patio and it was enjoyable . the food was good and the atmosphere was casual . i had the fettuccine alfredo and it was delish . my husband had the lamb burger with sweet potato fries and they were yummy too . service was good with one small snafu- all of our food didn 't come out at the same time . there was 5 of us and the last thing to come out was a salad and then the dressing took another minute or two . overall , tasty and we 'll definitely be coming back .
american	i have to say it was excellent ! the filet melted in my mouth , broccolini tender and tasteful . my friend had prime rib and it was delicious . our server was great and having heard it was my birthday , brought over a tasty chocolate cheesecake with a candle . we had wine , appetizers , good bread and nice salads prior to our entree . we will go back . oh , and we were able to converse without screaming over each other , a big plus in our book .
american	i walked in side and all tables we 're taken and the line was long ( i came in around 12 : 45 ) . the line took less than 5 minutes and as soon as i put the ice in my cup , my food was ready . this was one of the best fast food experiences i 've ever had and a great first impression from popeyes .
american	i had the apple cinnamon pancake which was phenomenal and my friend had the ham and cheese omlette which was just as good as any omlette . i highly recommend this place to anyone in the area and i would definitely go back !
american	the reviewers were spot on . this is a great southern fare restaurant with a warm friendly staff . our waiter recommended the chicken-n-watermelon-waffles . ( $ 36.00 ) my husband and i added buttermilk biscuits ( $ 7.00 ) and crispy brussel sprouts ( $ 10.00 ) to our order . the fried chicken is served with spiced watermelon and a vermont cheddar cheese waffle . they kick it up a notch by adding a side of honey hot sauce and bourbon maple syrup . the flavor combination of this meal is incredibly delicious . the chicken is 100 percent natural with no steroids or hormones and brined for 27 hours before serving . i loved the biscuits and the brussel sprouts did not disappoint .
american	who doesn 't love a mimosa that actually tastes like champagne . if you 're trying this place for the first time , please do yourself a favor and order the beastwich . this will not disappoint at all !
american	i ordered the tri tip plate with macaroni and cheese , and coleslaw . i really enjoyed my meal . the tri tip was tender and tasty and my two sides were really yummy . the staff was very nice and helpful . i had to give big b 's texas bbq 4 stars because i wished they had more than just one bbq sauce . i like my bbq sauce spicy and sweet . i will be back !
american	but had a pretty good experience for table of 8 . really good service , solid cocktails , a menu with something for everyone . the crispy duck is a must have , i 'd even forego a steak for it , asian style with mu shu panckaes & hoisin .. good stuff . the steaks were solid , not the best in the world ( or in town ) like a craftsteak , but did the job . side dishes sounded great but fell flat . hash browns with bacon were try and not super tasty .
american	the burgers were really good , so was the beer . but two things stuck with me : 1 . the milkshakes were just out of this world with the pudding on top . 2 . when the waitress set the jalapeno popper shots down , she very casually mentioned " oh , and one of them is extra spicy , but it 's a surprise . "
american	i ordered a simple medium sausage pizza and picked it up about 15 minutes later , hot out of the oven . it . was . amazing . even better , if you decide you want to eat there again within 3 days and provide your receipt they 'll give you half off the next time around . from now on if i have a hankering for pizza around henderson , bistro will be my first call !
american	good timing i guess ! believe the hype ! we usually just order a regular gyro to split , and make sure your splitting with someone who doesn 't mind how you look while you stuff your face . nothing pretty about trying to manage a gyro the size of your head , but it sure is delicious .
american	i tend to trust todd 's judgement in food so i knew it would be a good time . and it was . a great cheesesteak made to order . i chose the " black and blue " which had a decent amount of blue cheese dressing on it plus lettuce and tomato and onions and peppers . not exactly " philly " traditional , but who cares ? it tasted excellent . and priced right ! they have a pepsi fountain and one of the buttons dispenses soda water . this is a plus for me . and bonus ! they have free wifi ! i 'll be back !
american	we were greeted at the door and were seated after a very short wait . our drink orders were taken quickly while we looked over the menu . the restaurant seemed very clean and all of those who worked there were cheerful . we both chose mama 's short stack--two eggs , bacon , and two pancakes for $ 7.95 . eggs and bacon were prepared just as we requested and the pancakes were wonderful--very light and fluffy . we will return .
american	i got the california burger and it wasn 't the best burger i 've ever had , but it was pretty good . it was pretty neat seeing all the different sodas , i hadn 't had a jones soda in so long so they get points for that . it was good enough that i 'll be back to try them again eventually , just not anything to drive out of the way for anytime soon .
american	ordered philly cheese steak sandwiche and an original poutine . $ 18.50 for ones meal a bit pricey they should have combo menus to make things easier to try on the menu . philly cheese steak sandwiches was really tasty i believe it was 7-8 inches long and it was very cheesy . poutine was a small portion size for $ 7 probably would steer clear from there next time unless there some combo prices on the bar future . definitely have a lot of other items i would like to try on their menu . looking forward to checking this place out again
american	the choices for food at this airport are about as paltry as they come , but it 's hard to mess up a sub sandwich so i cast off the anchor and set a course for the port of subs . ( sorry , couldn 't help myself . ) i ordered a large italian with all the fixings ( except for onion ) . as far as sandwiches go , this was pretty good , especially the bread . the service was very friendly . i realize i am operating on a sliding scale due to the airport location , but i think four stars is accurate when compared to the other options .
american	we had previously experienced not so stellar service but i can say whole-heartedly that it was just a one-time mistake . our return visits to ohso have all been wonderful and delicious ! thank you for being such a dog friendly establishment too ! my dog loves it here !
american	the atmosphere was great , it was not overly crowed , although we arrived after 1 pm for lunch . my dish was grilled shrimp over seasoned rice with a sweet potato ( my favorite ! ) and fresh mixed veggies ( broccoli , cauliflower , and carrots ) . i was not disappointed ! this is a restaurant where i know that the food i order is going to make me feel umm , umm , good !
american	we dined here with friends who are members ( we belong to longue vue across the river ) and we were thoroughly impressed with the service , food , wine selection , and atmosphere . we had an incredible , reasonably priced meritage wine , delicious salmon with rice , roasted tomatoes and arugula , and homemade sorbet . the chef brought our food to the table and it was a beautiful touch . after being outdated for some time , the field club has stepped up their game and has delivered an elegant and fresh dining experience .
american	the buffalo chip was friendly and had an enjoyable atmosphere , cold beers and good food . our server checked in with us routinely and was a huge part of our magnificent time there ! heading back soon !
american	i wish i had gone sooner . i had the gorgonzola fillet and a baked potato . the meal was perfect . additionally the service was excellent . my waitress jen was very friendly and extremely helpful. the next time i am in cleveland , i will defiantly make it back to the chophouse !
american	although the service was again a little slow , the food was better than i remembered . we ordered a variety of items , from meatloaf , falafel salad , tomato bisque soup , fried chicken , and roast turkey . the portions were large and everything tasted great , clean plates all around . top picks seemed to be the fried chicken & meatloaf . i do look forward to getting back and trying a few more sides , b / c there were a lot .
american	what a great place ! i had the feel goods from the moment i walked in there . you can tell the staff is super passionate about what they do . they 're very friendly and caring people . and the food was tasty too ! my boyfriend and i both did build your own omelettes and didn 't hold back on the extras . i got a side of bacon and he got a side of fries and it was less than 20 bucks . what a steal ! i felt like i wanted to give them more money just because . my favorite part of the meal was the rosemary potatoes . yummy yummy ! rip kyle hodge
american	the chicken strips are sooo good , i 've been to this location a few times and the food has been fresh every time . the fries are so-so but the chicken strips make up for it . the only thing preventing the 5th star is that i really don 't like the canes sauce - and i asked that it not be put in the box ... not only was it in the box but it popped open and was all over the fries and some of the chicken .
american	we were not disappointed . the gyro was huge , with excellent seasoning and a tangy tzatziki sauce . i actually had trouble finishing it and ordered an extra pita to have the rest of the sandwich the next day . we 've been back on three other occasions and have come away with the same opinion ... it was all good and i would highly recommend a visit .
american	beating the brunch rush was great . we had a short wait but were seated quickly . service was friendly , if a bit rushed . my omelette was tasty , as were the accompanying home fries . everything was fresh and well-prepared . i would return , and it 's the kind of local joint i 'll look forward to bringing out-of-town guests to .
american	this permitted maximal imbibing , which is often limited by service time at other buffets . the roast beef was excellent , and very juicy . my only complaint was the lack of oysters on the half shell and seafood pizza . the dessert selection was superior to the bellagio 's buffet . i don 't recall clearly leaving the restaurant , but most of my clothes required laundering after exposure to this buffet .
american	only one of us had that but he gave the meal rave reviews . short ribs , filet and salmon were also excellent . rock shrimp and lobster mac and cheese were terrific as well . the stuffing was not great but i wouldn 't ding anyone for that . our server was excellent . if not for thanksgiving , we probably would never have found this hidden gem but now it 's on our foodie list . don 't let the lackluster location scare you , it 's different .
american	make sure you request a window seat and arrive a bit early . i cant say that i was very impressed with the food , expected more from a high end restaurant like canoe . however the presentation was very impressive . i think if you are celebrating an occasion , this is a great place to come ( or if u want to impress a date ) . personally i wouldn 't dine at this restaurant again but im glad i tried it at least once after reading such good reviews . the staff was very friendly and attentive . overall , the atmosphere and spectacular view made it a great experience and that 's why i gave it a 4 star rating
american	the only thing that made us grumpy was how long we had to wait for our food . however , the food was awesome when it finally came and the staff were apologetic . would recommend this place for breakfast if you 're not in a rush !
american	we had a starter of the q rolls , which i could have made a meal on . hubby and i both ate salads and split a pulled pork sandwich . our hosts had the combo and a pulled pork sandwich . all were delicious ! we ate a fresh donut as a complimentary dessert bite , which completed our awesome experience . we all agreed we 'd be back ! ! !
american	we remembered one of our twins faith and another family member mentioning about this awesome place . braddah and titah took us here and by golly wow ! ! it was fantastic ! love the salad bar carb section but most of all the soups ! gotta guarantee broke da mout their mushroom soup ! along with the fresh hot cornbread is so yummy ! have have to try ! thank you for taking us here and recommendations ! we love it !
american	their aioli burger was juicy and extremely delicious ! i would definitely return !
american	at first glance it doesn 't look like much but once you walk in it is a lot bigger than it looks . my friend and i were seated at the bar right away , our waitress was attentive , the food came quickly , was quite tasty and was reasonably priced . i would highly recommend this place and i plan on visiting on any future business trips i make to the area .
american	the food i had the 2nd time around was much better and it seemed like they weren 't trying too hard to reach beyond their abilities with the various ethnic foods and focused more on american and comfort type of food options . the cocktails continued to be very good , but i still find the ones at bar marco to be superior .
american	while not the most adventurous of eaters , i ordered the steak with mushroom sauce and the hubby had the duck . both were cooked fantastically , and served with the best veggie and potato sides . everything tasted so simple and fresh , i wanted to come back again and again . for dessert we each had white chocolate blueberry cheesecake and despite being stuffed , we finished every last bite . this place is a must visit !
american	in the last month i 've been in for business and pleasure , and each time it just gets better ! managers remember you and greet you at the table , servers remember me by name , and the food is always oh so good ! eat here now and often ... you will love it !
american	fate and yelp were merciful ; after entering " vegan " into the search field desert roots kitchen appeared on the map not 100 feet away . i thoroughly enjoyed their wrap , omg ! their generous servings had me full and ready for another workout .
american	simply put , it was amazing , mainly because of the service . the food was amazing too though . i ordered chicken strips , and while they were a bit pricey , i enjoyed them . i wish i would have gotten more fries with my order , and believe i should have gotten more . however , the food was great nonetheless . employees working at this location were great . that is probably the only word i can sum them up as . they were so friendly and helpful , and made me extremely glad i finally visited this restaurant . i cannot wait to go back . i love the atmosphere .
american	i wasn 't overly hungry , but when i noticed the deep-fried dill pickles on the menu , i knew i had to try them . i 've eaten various appetizers like this before , but they were always sliced pickles . not here . you 're getting the whole spear , which i thought was much better . add a couple of pints of dogfish 60 min ipa , the nl beating up on the al in the all-star game and baseball debate with gentlemen at the bar and i had myself a very enjoyable evening .
american	yummy pasta and cooked veggies , veggie spring rolls , hummus was a bit bland but such is life ! there was good guacamole or at least decent which made my day very happy ! they had veggie quesadillas and cheese enchiladas . save room for dessert ! ! i had the fruit cobbler with some soft serve ice creme on top and then about 1 / 2 of a piece of strawberry shortcake ! ! yum !
american	there was a short line , but it went by pretty quickly - which was good since my tummy was growling of hunger . we were seated near the gardens so we had a beautiful view of all the pretty flowers and such . our waitress was very attentive and nice . the food was pretty tasty ( i had the lobster eggs benedict ) and their ice tea was a thirst quencher . the only drawback , however ; are their prices . they are a little bit on the pricier side so be prepared for that .
american	pastrami ruben for hubby ... he gave it 5 stars . seafood pita 4 me ... 5 stars . easy to get to with yelp directions .
american	we had heard about zeta 's and decided to stop by . zeta 's grill is clean , spacious , and inviting and the staff and service border on amazing . i have to admit on my first visit to zeta 's i over ate because the food was so good . my sister and i had the hummus shawarma chicken , spicy potatos , fried cauliflower , and the mixed grill kebab . it was great to try a few different dishes . i was unprepared for how good the food was and i will return soon to sample more entrée 's . my first visit was pure enjoyment to find such a great place to dine .
american	we were a party of 10 and my friend called ahead to let them know we were coming . luckily , a party of 12 was a no-show and we got seated immediately . the staff are so amazingly friendly and accommodating on such a busy saturday morning . i ordered the veggie eggs benedict , which come with cajun potatoes . being a mexican , i love spicy food ; so they do have a kick , but that 's exactly how i like them . when we go back next year for the race , we 'll be stopping by grumpy 's again . extra kudos to the wonderful gal that tended to our large party !
american	we were greeted by the friendly staff , and our wait was minimal . we started off with coffee , while we looked at the menu . i ordered the tri fecta , which was 2 eggs , a choice of meat , and a choice of a waffle or pancake . it was very tasty . all the food was very fresh , and our server was attentive . i would definitely recommend making a stop here if you 're in the area .
american	i feel a bit defeated since i am a new yorker . schwartz 's reminds me of katz deli in manhattan but it looks dirtier , smaller but the jewish servants remain . their smoked meat sandwich is not as meaty as katz but it is juicier and tastier . they don 't have fancy sauces but yellow mustard . surprisingly , it is good enough for all of us . their dill is also great as well as their coleslaw . try the black cherry soda with your sandwich and get used to being cramped inside . i would come back to montreal just for the sandwich !
american	you could tell by the way he spoke that this man knows bbq , and the food backed up the claim . from the wings to the chicken , the ribs to the pork belly , everything they laid down in front of us was perfectly prepared . the sides were also some of the best i 've ever had - mac ' n cheese , baked beans ... these guys a legit . i could ramble forever about how awesome rubs is , but do yourself a favour and just go try it yourself .
american	very quick to get food and it was tasty . kudos to a & w for not gouging the travelling public .
american	you know food is good where no one is talking and eyes are to the hand to the burger to the mouth because you know if you miss a beat a crumb just might fall off the plate ! ! and then comes the explosion ! ! ! literally ... dessert which consists of deep fried mars bar and is served with vanilla ice cream and drizzled with chocolate sauce ! ! ! oh my g ! ! ! and hey if it 's time for prayer , there is a prayer room downstairs ... make sure you thank the one above for this joint : - )
american	i didn 't believe it until we ate the food. it was awesome ! my kids complimented on it and the cheese was high quality , not like little caesars or any other commercial pizza parlors . the house salad was amazing .. we are from california and we were at a nearby baseball park for a tournament this restaurant was well worth it we will always come back when we are in town thank you for such a delicious meal and kind service .
american	what a wonderful experience . the owner jeff was the epitome of what a owner / chef should be . extremely kind and went above and beyond explaining the menu . the food was phenomenal ! highly suggest the hush puppies and bbq pulled pork sandwich . last but certainly not least , the ambiance is on point . quaint , intimate , with a hint of old world charm ... perfect setup for tinder dates : )
american	o i absolutely hate buffet , yet i tried almost every buffet in las vegas and nothing parallels to the bellagio one yet. i wish people realize how bad buffet is ... how it can make us fat and greedy and wasteful. but then again , it 's vegas and you do stuff you normally wouldn 't , so ready to unbutton your pants and leave at least 2 hour gap in your schedule so you can truly enjoy the food and get your money 's worth .
american	we liked it so much the first time we had to got back a second ! sandy was our waitress and provided great service and good menu suggestions . everything we had was so delicious that we came back with more college friends in 2013 and enjoyed it just as much ! highly recommend and ask for sandy 's section . only disappointment was it is closed on sundays and mondays ; we would gone there three times if opened then . but employees need time off to be with their family and friends , too !
american	i didn 't know it existed . we sat down and were chatting and catching up on life , the waitress was so patient and friendly and brought us our iced teas . we finally got around to ordering , i was watching the deeeelicious looking food being served around me , every thing looked so good and when i got my dinner " it was very tasty . " i felt very comfortable and i enjoyed the atmosphere ! the service was fantastic for us ! i say " yumm "
american	i asked for extra tahini sauce and was given a large side order of it at no extra charge . the cauliflower was very tasty , but i agree that it tastes even better when re-heated in my toaster oven the next day . yes , there 's enough to either share or save 1 / 2 for another day . the seasoning and the tahini sauce make this dish awesome . i have returned for this dish , and it was even better the second time around . yum ! i 've only ordered take-out thus far , so i 'll update once i have a dine-in experience .
american	honestly , i go here once a month at minimum with a group of people , at least 6-12 at a time . the service is top-notch , we are always greeted with a smile , the managers know us by name as well as group , and the food is always on par with the ihop restaurants in upstate ny . i have rarely ever had a complaint , and if i did , the staff did their best to make sure it was corrected as quickly as possible . for a national brand that ihop is , i am not expecting 5-star meals every time , but they do fairly well with what they have .
american	it was during a workday and found metered parking for a hour / $ 1.00 . i was solo and sat at the counter which gave me a view of the chefs in action . started off with a tasty satisfying cup of joe . for my main entry , i had the pancakes , chicken sausage and added two poached eggs . the pancakes were some of the yummiest i 've ever had . the chicken sausage went nicely with my medium poached eggs and the service from my waiter was friendly and spot on . overall satisfied ! the menu is southern influenced so i 'm looking forward to returning and trying the shrimp & grits or beignets .
american	they have a pretty extensive menu and i had a blood orange cocktail that was to die for . i had a chicken dish while my hubby enjoyed the surf and turf special . great deal for the money ... i was surprised at the meals you can get for $ 12- $ 15 a plate . we shared the half baked cookie for desert .... yummy ! the only reason i didn 't give this place a 5 was because the parking is kinda screwy .
american	just recently moved to the area from pa . we were welcomed by chef christopher and wonderful waitress , aynsley . the food was excellent and i especially loved the sautéed onions on top of my veggie burger and delicious sweet potato fries ! for desert we enjoyed the brownie with caramel sea salt ice cream . it was definitely the best lunch since moving to scottsdale and looking forward to returning ...
american	located right behind bally 's on the strip , they offer an amazing steak dinner for $ 7.99 ! it comes with soup / salad , steak , green beans , baked / mashed potatoes and a beer . honestly , i was skeptical of the food once i walked in , but i 'm not going to lie , it was great . i was stuffed by the end and i couldn 't believe our dinner for 2 was less than $ 20 ! i wouldn 't be eating this every night , but it 's definitely a hidden gem in vegas ! -- check out my other reviews at http : / / nextstopdc.blogspot.com /
american	so happy i did . servings were huge . i am not a poutine lover but taste was good . service was little bit slow .
american	we had high expectations which doesn 't always bode well , but the food exceeded our expectations . my wife had the crab cake sandwich and she loved it . i was able to get a bite and also thought it was tasty . the portion size was large enough that she skipped dinner . i enjoyed the cajun shrimp po 'boy and would have it again . the spices were perfect . they gave the sandwich flavor , but was not overpowering . we are planning on going back soon .
american	sadly , all i found was arby 's . the bathrooms were very clean but i found a piece of toilet paper stuck on the ground and i stepped on it and broke my sternum . luckily i am a masochist so it wasn 't a big deal . food was a meal .
american	we arrived around 10 : 40 and were immediately seated ina large booth in the corner . our friendly server came over right away and took drinks orders while explaining a few particularly popular many items . items chosen ; chicken waffles ( he loved it ) , apple-cinnamon pancake ( yummy and seriously the size of a medium pizza ! ) , kids hamburger ( huge , said to be a little oily tasting ) , and egg white scramble with avocado and sweet potato fries ( good ) . while the portions are easily large enough for 2 people to share , one will not be disappointed if comfort foods is your hankering .
american	good bye subxxx . hello which wich . so delicious ! a quick lunch sandwich filled to the ends of the bread bun . and neatly cut in half in case you want to save the other half for later . i picked white bread , chicken pesto , swiss cheese , lettuce , tomatoes , black olives , mushroom , and candied walnuts . and then a side of bbq kettle chips for more crunchiness . what a great sandwich experience enjoyed out in the patio chairs nearby !
american	the place had a relaxed atmosphere , with the offerings of fish sure to please everyone . i had a chance to try a few items while i waited for my car and had an awesome experience . the bluewater roll was excellent , as well as the mashed potatoes . the calamari , while tasty , was slightly salty ( it could have easily been me though ) . the best part was the key lime pie at the end--tasted fresh and worth the trip . the staff is super friendly and the bartender rachael was amazing ! she made sure i was taken care of and made my first experience a great one .
american	my husband and i ordered a 14 " original crust , sausage w / 1 / 2 pepperoni , 1 / 2 mushroom . i thought it was very good . the wheat dough is very yummy and i was even more excited to find out it was only 4 pts for 4 slices on my ww diet . very friendly service . it 's not your typical greasy , cheesy pizza which i love as well . but if you are trying to be health conscious , this is for you .
american	they are amazingly good and simple all at once. and for the price of 1.50 each i was super happy . its in a hotdog bun with lettuces and onions , a nice long piece of fried chicken and a couple slices of tomatoes covered in a sauce of your choice . a much better alternative to the hotdog . amazingly tasty and kind of freaky that its so tasty : )
american	after looking at the online menu and checking for specials , we found out that it was 10 $ pizza 's on mondays . there were some pretty fancy looking pizzas on the menu , so we made sure to ask our server if there were any limitations on what we could order . nope , it was all 10 $ . we got there at about 8 , the place was busy but not packed . nice looking bar , tables and booths in dark fabrics and woods , cosy looking , casual fancy . server was attentive and the food arrived quickly . portions are good for sharing . returned recently for brunch and it was equally enjoyable .
american	the waffle was good . the chicken wings were large and seasoned well . good to know this place is open 24 / 7 in case i need to visit at anytime during my next sojourn to charmeck !
american	service was good and prompt . only one person in our group complained that he didn 't get his water refilled enough , but he drinks water like a tuna . my steak was cooked to perfection . only complaint was that my wife 's prime rib was a little fatty . our party of six all agreed that we would come back again .
american	i 'm glad we did . service was excellent . they came and checked on us constantly ( almost annoyingly so ) and were on top of everything . the food seemed fairly priced and i ended up getting the chicken fried steak . what came out was a massive plate of food to include eggs , hashbrowns , toast , and a huge cut of meat deep fried and slathered with gravy . i honestly only ate half of it before i was stuff and felt like i left a huge portion on the plate . top notch .
american	so , we had unbelievably good service ! ! our drinks were checked on often , without being obtrusive . as for the burgers , not only was it $ 11 wednesday for building your own burger , but they were really good .......... beer looked cold , but 3 of 4 of us were not drinking at lunch ! ! lol ! !
american	we went at 11 : 00am , the place was empty and didn 't look too appealing . however , the owners were extremely friendly and attentive . i ordered the western hash omelet with a coffee , my mom ordered the big village breakfast . i must warn you their portions are huge ! i finished only 1 / 3 of my meal . the food was so delicious , probably one of the best brunch joints i have been to . the only problem is the wait time can be a little long , but you have to take in consideration that their food is prepared fresh and on the spot . : )
american	overall it was pretty good . our server ( i wish i got his name ) was really personable and went over the menu and drink options for us . we both ordered sandwiches that were tasty . this is definitely a hole in the wall but if you like places like this like i do then i 'd recommend stopping in . we were told they have live music / karaoke most of the week .
american	we were warmly welcomed by jeff , the owner and chef , who showed us to our table . the menu was interesting and the prices perfect . we loved the hush puppies and bet salad we shared . my pork shoulder and my wife 's pot roast were amazing . beautifully presented and great tasting . we ended the meal w pineapple upside down butter cake . wow ... we loved it . jodi ( sp ? ) our server was delightful and gave us great menu tips . we will definitely be back . the ambiance / decor and overall atmosphere were just right .
american	some wandering around and asking locals lead us here . what a great find . i had the burger benedict which was very filling and good with a pile of fresh fruit . others at the table had other versions of the benedict which they all enjoyed . service was attentive and they were able to easily accommodate our party of 8 . patio dining was also excellent , not too noisy , crowded and good shade from trees nearby .
american	shackburger and fries were good . ordered a root beer float but they were out of root beer . fun atmosphere .
american	i went pretty early , around 1 or 2 pm on a saturday . the food came out quickly and the chicken and waffles surpassed my expectations . i was worried the waffles would be too sweet and heavy but they were actually really light and savory . the fried chicken was moist and whatever sauce they put on it was great . my fiancé got something and it came with these truffle chips . oh . my . god . amazing . definitely would come back whenever i 'm downtown again .
american	i got the double char with swiss and it was good and fresh tasting and the onion rings were good also . friendly staff and bright clean space although it was sad to see it was the old my florist cafe which was a great place .. at least they are keeping the sign up . all in all a good place to grab a burger .
american	our waiter said they are known for their pizza , ( many restaurants have told me that over the years and been very average ) our waiter was right , we ordered a sandwich and a deep dish pizza and both were excellent , especially the pizza ! and to top it off the bill came to less than $ 50 , ( pizza , a sandwich and a few cocktails ) .next time in vegas we will definitely be back !
american	we were immediately greeted by a friendly and knowledgeable staff . the " man " salad was wonderful ! the ingredients were all fresh and the tuna was delicious ! the prices are great for the quality of ingredients and the portion size . the sandwiches looked awesome ! i will definitely return !
american	delicious ! we had the apple cinnamon french toast , and the avocado scramble . service was prompt and attentive . delicious !
american	we tried four different hot dogs and loved them all . the chili cheese dog was incredible as well as the take on the chicago dog ( i forget what they called theirs ) the toppings bar with pickles and and other cool choices was super unique . the only down side was the sides , we tried the beans and cole slaw and didn 't care for either one . the cole slaw had no flavor what so ever and the beans were simply not what i was expecting . i will return for the hot dogs soon and skip the sides .
american	you pick the meat , they make the sandwich . i chose pastrami which came between two thick cut slices of fresh italian bread . under the bread , in addition to the meat was a nice slice of tomato , a generous helping of a vinegar based cole slaw , provolone cheese and a mound of home cut perfectly cooked and seasoned french fries . severed fast and friendly , but be careful .. cash only .
american	i got the crawfish in the mild hot and juicy seasoning and shrimp in cajun seasoning . if i could do it again i would just get the crawfish with the hot and juicy sauce . it was so good ! ! ! don 't forget to suck the head and wear a bib .
american	it 's not that close to the house or it 'd be my daily stop before work . yup . the coffee / lattes / chai are that good . i 've eaten breakfast and lunch and the food was good , too . one of these days i will go for their dinner and try their mixed drinks .
american	i am so glad i did ! food was amazing and had a great beer selection ! of course the i loved the pizza but i was surprised how good the wings and fries were ! everything is made from scratch and very fresh . this place and any of the naked city pizza locations are worth a visit while in vegas !
american	i never had afghani food before but love exploring different foods and learning about different cultures . my husband spent time in afghanistan and wanted to visit as well . we went with my son , brother and sis-in-law . i think we ordered the entire menu and it was all delicious ! i can 't even think of one particular dish i would recommend . we will definitely be back . i think there may be one or two items on the menu we didn 't try .
american	after seeing this place on diners drive-ins and dives had to try it the paprika schnitzel was wonderful as was the stuffed mushrooms and potato pancakes four stars for that the beer gave you five
american	we ordered the shrimp and crab in their mild garlic butter sauce with corn and potatoes . it was fresh and delicious with a spicy edge ( even for mild ) . be prepared to dig in and get dirty . i highly recommend using the " stylish " plastic apron they provide . we oozed garlic from our pores for about two days !
american	we also ordered the beer cheese soup and an old fashioned burger . everything was great and extremely cheesy . we also love beer flights and this restaurant specializes in them .
american	the pig dip is the signature dish and it was everything i thought it would be . edgy atmosphere and complimentary valet parking made it convenient . service was average and the valet driver was not afraid to hit the gas and squeal the tires on my tundra . go for the food , you won 't be disappointed .
american	thanks to catharine our server who was very attentive and quick to check on us often ! a big smile and friendly attitude is always nice thanks . i tried the apricot chicken low fat meal and was pleasantly surprised , it was still of flavor and enough to fulfill my appetite .
american	this is my favorite and only place that i do eat a burger at. i was a hater at first yes . but fatburger worked its way into my heart and i admit they know how to make a delicious f-ing burger here ! ! consistency in their food is solid here , and nothing better than being able to count on a place where you will always get a good meal ... over and over again . kudos fatburger
american	i wish there were more sausage , it was a great compliment with the cute jar of syrup provided . the pancakes were decent .
american	the place is still good . love the chicago style pizza : enough bread and cheese to kill a donkey ( to chi-pizza newcomers this is a good thing ) . two slices and you won 't be able to eat for days ..... heavenly . only one thing prevents me from giving this place 5 stars : that awful sammy sosa jersey hanging on the wall . lose that idiot 's jersey and replace it with something else .... bang ! 5 stars !
american	i made a reservation through yelp for lunch and was promptly seated as soon as we arrived . our party ordered the beer battered asparagus and absolutely loved it . the overall service was great and very respectful in helping my grandma get through the doors with her walker . the only reason for rating 4 stars instead of 5 would be that our waitress seemed impatient with giving us a few minutes to order and came off a bit rude when asking who would be taking the check . regardless , i 'll be back for the beer , destihl ! !
american	i 'm happy i did . i ordered the cream soda , along with the bbq burger with beer cheese potatoes . it was all terrific ! the cream soda was to die for , and the burger and potatoes were great too . the potatoes especially were different from anything i could get back home and very flavorful . the service was friendly and very quick . the next time you 're in town , give it a try .
american	pricing a little weird on sides , one side $ 2.50 , two $ 4.00 , three $ 6.50 ? odd progression . sides are large . chicken and ribs are well seasoned , not too much or little , and bbq or hot sauce is available . sweet potatoes are awesome !
american	it 's beyond refreshing to see a server that so clearly loves what she does ! hats off to holly and her team ! keep up the awesome work !
american	very good food , and it is prepared fast and served hot . awesome soups . huge , quality burgers . daily specials are a good deal . haven 't tried any desserts because the meals have always been huge . highly recommend this restaurant location .
american	i have yet to try anything other than their deep dish pizza but i had the privilege of watching someone attempt and complete the sears tower eating challenge , which was disgusting and amazing all at once . the man was able to eat over seven pounds of italian beef , sausage with peppers in bread with a side of fries . someone really chose to attempt this ? it was insane to watch but definitely entertaining . can 't wait to try more of their menu soon .
american	we 've eaten breakfast too many times to count , often enough to have tried everything on the menu and to know it by heart . they bring a gourmet complexity to each dish raising their fare well above most breakfast offerings in the phoenix metro area . the only downside is the wait after 9am but you get that wherever the food is awesome .
american	my husband and i have celebrated many special occasions here , including both of our birthdays last year , plus valentine 's day when they had a special couple 's menu . and we went countless other times , as well . the environment cannot be topped . the food is amazing . the service is friendly , courteous and professional . i literally dream about their bolognese . i no longer live in phoenix , but whenever i visit this will be my first stop .
american	late enough to avoid the crowd and get a patio table -- cold beers and a hot evening goes very well with that setting . i 'll mention the food just because i got it : my salmon was fine by me , just slightly overpriced for what it is ( i guess that 's what you pay for lake erie 's best ) . the beer . i miss . great lakes . so much . i had a few lake erie monster 's and a dortmunder , and i think they both taste significantly better on draft versus bottled . if you 're never been , you should check out glbc at least once .
american	it is absolutely fabulous ! very casual , yet classy . lots of noise and buzz . i ordered their kefta kabob dinner . what i loved the most was how you can choose your side salad . not like most restaurant where they give you a standard house salad . i would say there were at lease 7 salad options . i chose the mashu mashu salad which had a sweet balsamic dressing with goats cheese . i have been craving that salad since i finished my meal . defiantly returning in the near future .
american	since wolfgang puck had a reputable and popular name , we felt safe coming here to eat . we arrived just as they opened and hh was all day long ! ordering some beers , caprese salad , bruschetta , and pizza , we were stuffed and still had money in our wallet . the decor is nice located right in the middle of the mall with beautiful wood chairs and tables . it was a nice find for a famished family , leaving satisfied and not ripped off .
american	hidden behind the gas station , well there was a fuel truck at the station blocking the view too . there 's live jazz music playing , romantic dinner , the butter poach was the best , it melts in your mouth , i was in butter joy in the hours to come . appetizer include oyster with quarter of exotic sauces , love that spicy vodka sauce . server claim it has the best calamari in toronto , yea ! she was right ! totally coming back for more
american	parking lot can be a hassle however once you get in you are golden . just gotta brave the wait for me 3x3 because the drive thru is usually very long . i 'm never bothered by the line at in-n-out burger because it 's expected . i change up my burger each time depending on my mood . sometimes i get animal style or sliced raw onions they have many options for such a limited menu . you just can 't go wrong with in-n-out burger . they actually remember to give you place mats at this location too .
american	considering it was just at the other side of the parking lot we were easy game . my sisters , mom , and i walked into the place to check out the menu and were pleasantly surprised - there was a lot of healthy and delicious looking options to choose from . i went for the voodoo chicken salad and was so impressed and thought it was absolutely delicious ! the chicken was moist and flavorful , the sauce was tasty and not overdone . it was a filling yet light meal . the place was very clean and comfortable and the perfect break between shopping trips !
american	the service was awesome . our server was cheryl and she was great . the food was also really great and they have a good beer selection .
american	we went at 11 : 00 and it was already packed . i see why . i got the pineapple terriyaki burger and she got the char . both yummy and seemed very fresh . we also got the onion rings and fries and didn 't leave anything behind . burgers & fries may seem a trivial meal and hard to screw up but this place makes fast food a thing of the past . the staff was super friendly to our first experience and we will definitely go back avoiding mcd , jack & wendy . i rank habit right up there with in-n-out and a bit more comfy casual .
american	you get a seat , then a menu then order at the till then get a buzzer . buzzer goes off and hey presto you collect your shake and burger ! simple service so far . my shake consisted of vanilla and choc chunks - mmmm i tell ye f-a-b-u-l-o-u-s ! ! ! the fries were out of this world - crispy and potato like ! i choose the chicken patty which had goats cheese pesto and tomato - a fantastic combo and was one of the specials - i would have it again ! just wish the portions were a little bigger for the price but all very tasty !
american	it 's ~ $ 35 per person for weekend dinner , but i think it 's definitely worth it . they have both snow crab and alaskan king crab legs that are already pre-cracked for . their selection of red meat is also much better than the other buffets , including kalbi-marinated ostrich , prime rib , quail , pork loin and more . and don 't forget to leave room for a plate or two of desserts . all the mini-sized desserts are delicious and just the right portion for when your stomach is starting to run low on space . be sure to get there around 5 : 30-6pm as the line does start to build up later on .
american	hearty european fare , always fresh and well prepared . fab service and ambience ......... stay in business for another 50 years !
american	let me say , i was skeptical at first -- but holy crap , this place is awesome ! ! best fried bologna sandwich i 've probably ever had , and the hubs pretty much devoured his burger . it was so good that we try to stop by every other week ! don 't be discouraged by the area , this place is a true hole-in-the-wall but it 's well worth it . and fyi it 's cash only .
american	they seem genuinely concerned with their customers ' experiences and i value that a lot in a business . he offered me a free meal in the downtown los angeles location ( where i live ) to make up for my mediocre initial visit . thank you so much doug , and the tom 's urban team ! i 'm excited to review the dtla location ! it 's awesome to know that they take feedback so genuinely .
american	finding a burger joint that caters to gluten-free consumers is not always easy . i walked in here with great skepticism because i thought that i would have to walk out disappointed and settle for chips and nuts somewhere . the waiter assured me and made me feel welcome . though the burger was not the best ( e.g. dry tasting bun ) , the service was great .
american	we appreciate their effort to provide support anyway they could . # gottalovegoodcustomerservice
american	really great and inventive food and superb service , especially for the level of service you usually get inside of a casino . everyone in my party loved what they got both times , and everything was beautifully plated . it has a great atmosphere as well . if you 're 21 + you have to try the smoked whiskey . one of my favorite drinks of all time . if i 'm ever in vegas again , i 'll definitely be coming back .
american	everything from the greeters to our server was excellent the bourbon selection was top-notch would definitely recommend it to anyone in town we are in indianapolis area and have been too many nice restaurants in the area this ranks among the best that i have been to .
american	that a large plate of delicious biscuits and gravy and a side of home fried potatoes . it just kills me that i didn 't know about this place sooner or my friends and i would have walked the 4 blocks behind the cromwell hotel to eat all of our meals here ! annnd .... saved about $ 20 a meal . it 's not a pretty place , but it 's clean , the staff is friendly and you won 't feel robbed when you get your bill . your credit card will thank you later .
american	the service was some of the friendliest we saw for our entire vegas stay
american	fez was fantastic ! we both loved the gyro pita , which has now become our favorite gyro over the one we had in washington dc after a long , cold , hungry day ( so that 's definitely saying something ) . the place had a cool vibe and was pretty busy at 3 on a thursday afternoon if that tells you anything . this is another pheonix must , that 's for sure !
american	not here . just happened upon this place one evening . they had a couple of " specialty " pizzas on special , so we ordered one . this pizza was shockingly amazing . the crust was absolutely perfect and the toppings were just right . hot , firm , and just the right amount of juicy to be mouthwatering without messing up the crust . we 've since been back several times for the pizza , and last time had a sandwich as well which was also excellent ( boar 's head meat ) . the house-made chips were an unexpected treat . nice folks , great food , check it out .
american	the crudessence on mackay doesn 't disappoint . i went there with my boyfriend and was happy to find a cozy and romantic ambiance for our dinner that was not overly expensive . it 's not everyone who likes eating raw , so you need to go to this place knowing that food will just not taste the same way it usually does . we enjoyed their food so much , we even got the cookbook ! we ate lasagna ( 5 / 5 ) , blt ( 4 / 5 ) and ate tiramisu and cheesecake . we 're already fans . plus , they have good wine .
american	the dining area is minimal but clean , and the servers are very friendly . i ordered two cheese pizzas with pepperoni--all their pizzas appear to be cheese and toppings are extra--with a drink ( they carry pepsi products ) . the pizza came out hot and greasy , like one would expect from a good pizzeria , and really hit the spot .
american	the place was welcoming , very relaxing & our waitress was very helpful & friendly ! she said the burgers were great & the az burger did not disappoint , highly recommend & will return next year when we 're back at the track
american	frustrated we finally found parking down at the docks and discovered against the grain totally by accident.it was a friday night and really busy on the patio . we were tired and hungry and were about to turn away when the manager , teresa wilson , immediately took charge and managed to seat us quickly . we enjoyed one of the best tables on the patio , great food and the best service we have experienced in awhile . our special thanks to teresa and the great staff that night for the memorable experience . and we were delighted to finally find a beautiful setting on the toronto waterfront to eat . will definitely return .
american	in terms of affordable eats in the casino , you 're kind of screwed . there 's not a food court to speak of so you 're not going to get a burger or slice of pizza . but if you 're prepared for it , hit the deli . you 'll be looking at about $ 16 for a sandwich , but for the money you 'll either be stuffed for the night or you 'll have food for two days . couple that with sides that are great ; potato pancakes i would push an elderly woman down a well for .. it 's not cheap but holy fuck is it worth it ..
american	everything from the ambiance , to the wait staff , to the amazing food was perfect from the moment we walked in . the pork belly slaw was a amazing twist for a stater salad . that followed by the perfect medium rare cooked bone in ribeye was a perfect combination , along with the risotto . the mushroom & pancetta risotto has to be the best tasting side dish i have had in las vegas , and i have eaten an numerous places there . all in all , i cannot say anything bad about my experience . i would definitely recommend dinning here .
american	enter phillips seafood . opted for the mahi & shrimp platter with hush puppies & slaw . now don 't get me wrong , i likes me a high-class meal . but when i 'm in vegas all alone-like , i use my total rewards reward credits . and at thirteen ninety-nine , this fits the bill perfectly . yes , some of it was a wee bit over-cooked , but that 's better than under-cooked ! c 'mon , fish ? in the desert ? and i 'm not sick ? that 's a win anytime . now leave me alone , after all that good protein , daddy 's gonna disco nap !
american	being the owner of a small chicago-land restaurant ( nu crepes ) i 'm keen on the importance of yelp to small independently-owned restaurants . once again yelp and their reviewers came thru for me . they directed me to mr. mama 's . loved this place . simple breakfast done perfectly . which is not as easy as it sounds . great staff , super friendly , attentive and accommodating . worth the wait . do yourself a favor and wait if you have to . life is short , so be patient and savour the goodness that will come when you get your delicious breakfast . i will certainly be back on my next trip out west .
american	got sat down by a bitch hostess ( huge attitude ) but thankfully our server was good ! ! food was good but nothing special , wouldn 't go out of my way to eat here but if i 'm in the area and wanted a burger i would go here .
american	our experience was wonderful . every employee we interacted with was genuinely helpful and positive . our orders ( all double doubles with different toppings ) were all correct and delicious . we are from the midwest and have only been to in n out twice , but based on our experience , we understand why it 's so popular .
american	we were not disappointed . we are not from vegas and can 't enjoy it like the locals do . but i would certainly choose this place over an over priced gordon ramsey any day . very friendly staff . will certainly be back next time we are in town chris m. orange county , ca
american	because of that , we stopped in for coffee . place is very clean and service was great . coffee was pretty tasty ! monica did have breakfast . i don 't believe i ever saw her take a bite so i guess she enjoyed it . i 'd love to return to try their breakfast or lunch menu . cheers * * * : )
american	the duck wrapped in the bao was so tasty ! i ordered the special hog burger as an recommendation from my waitress . the burger came out just right ! it was juicy and delicious ! i love the dramatics of the fire inside the glass windows . we sat right by the fire but yet it wasn 't even hot . the only bad thing about sitting by the fire are the diners that want a picture by the fire so you constantly have people going up taking pictures while your eating . other than that i would highly recommend trying out this restaurant . before you go , you must try their amazing push pop dessert . one of my favorite desserts !
american	brian was an outstanding server and based on his description i opted for the lasagna , which is made with filet meat ! it was out of this world . hit this place before it goes away with the rebranding of the monte carlo .
american	of course i had to return this fall with all my friends to pig out at this buffet . step 1 before going , fast for as long as you can imagine . you will find more amazing food here then you could ever think of , the buffet is so long you can walk off all the calories just trying to find all the food you want to consume . let 's not forget the dessert selections are amazing , so don 't fill up on the main courses
american	its literally the same kind of set up one would find at a local county fair or carnival . it would also be nice to have it open 24 hrs because getting a decent meal at this casino is nearly impossible . for only $ 1 you can get an all natural hot dog and load it up with lots of fixings . it says something when the line at a hot dog cart is longer than the line for the casino 's buffet .
american	we sat in the renovated upstairs bar area where the tables are a nice wood without table cloths so it 's less stuffy and feels very cozy . i wish they would renovate the entire restaurant like this . it 's really lovely . the service was good , maybe a little slow but the food was very good . we will definitely return and i 'm glad we decided to give it another try .
american	i simply asked if anyone turned in a card which i doubted , stephanie simply called a manager , ted was amazing , tracked my purchase and since i had the receipt and my debit card reissued another card within minutes . exceptional customer service and when i asked if he had a manager i could commend him he said he was glad i just got my card back . excellent !
american	they offered a very impressive , affordable menu with many vegetarian options to boot ! we got there early enough to grab a table outside . a cozy communal atmosphere , great service , stellar craft beers and locally sourced entrees made our experience top notch ! the people watching was super entertaining , too ! the crispy pork shank , tempura cauliflower and mushroom flatbread come highly recommend ! ! ! my only regret is not getting photos of the food because the presentation was stellar ! we look forward to going back !
american	being from nj , its hard to find a real cheese steak here . it was so good , i brought my eleven friends back the next day .
american	glad i did the young man was so happy that i was there and made me feel as if i was family . plus you have bbq sauce in stock made it will be a good sign !
american	after the all the hype reviews of the capastrami sandwich , i had to try it . i ordered a medium sized sandwich which is 12 " which came out $ 9.35 tax included . the sandwich comes with a generous amount of pastrami with coleslaw and some type of dressing . first couple bites , i was like wow , this shit is great ! ! now everytime i visit vegas i will be hitting this place for sure and call ahead , because sandwich is made to order !
american	great patio . plus , water bowls and treats for the canine were provided . i also enjoyed my jalapeno cheesburger ! this is great place to hang with fido !
american	this place was a gem . located in a quant home in downtown glendale , the home boasts several themed rooms . the service , food , and ambience was perfect . my friend 's preteen daughter felt special with her own assortment of fruits and pastries . we will be back !
american	plan on starving yourself all day before the dinner buffet , otherwise you 'll regret not eating the extra 6 pounds of alaskan king crab legs you could have shoved down your gullet otherwise . everything i had was great , especially the kobe steak , porterhouse steak , lamb shanks , ahi nigiri , and beef bourguignon , beef wellington . which leads me to my next bit of advise : if you go to this buffet , be a carnivore . it is probably not worth it if you are a vegetarian or vegan . oh , don 't fill up on carbs or salad here , but that should be obvious to any seasoned face-stuffer .
american	this will be a new staple in our monthly diet , with or without the kids . we tried a salad , sandwich , and soup , in addition to carrot cake and butternut squash creme brûlée , and every bite was to die for ( for about $ 40 total ) . they have outdoor games and the seating is aplenty ... very affordable option for those wanting to indulge in the amazing foods available at the farm at south mountain .
american	our server myana was great . she got our food and drinks to us with good time . the food was delicious and filling . thank you red robbin for serving my family a wonderful meal . we will deffinentely come back .
american	which is when we came upon blt burgers - your basic burgers , fries , shakes and beers joint . and it was right there . we ordered the blt ( double smoked bacon , lettuce and tomato ) , the shaft 's blue ( shaft 's blue vein cheese , balsamic caramelized onions , and mushrooms ) , some fries and a couple draft beers . the food was excellent . love , love , love . of course , when we were done , and we had blt burger all over the place , the nearest washroom was like 10 miles away , through the casino .
american	we came to eat . ordered appetizer . firecracker shrimp and omg let me just say it was to die for . also the captains punch . yummy yummy drink . my sister ordered the fish and chips and let 's just say lots of food . better come with big appetite . i ordered the rib eye with bake potato and man i 'm so full but don 't want to waste it .
american	i has the gyro wrap ( it 's huge ) and a homemade piece of baclava for under $ 10 , spouse had the gyro salad-they don 't skip on the giant fresh pitas either ! we 'll be seeing you again ... soon ! !
american	we found this place . it was close by so it was a plus ! we got there and its freaking awesome . their order style is like pei wei , you dont have to deal wtih servers and stuff , but the staff is awesome . they were super nice and attentive ! their food was delicious ! we got the french toast and the steak and eggs . it was so filling but not to the point to where you wanna throw up. the location sucks , but with how great this place is , who cares ! we found our new breakfast spot ! no more ihop , dennys , etc !
american	well good thing i didn 't go when memphis was still by my house because they would have lost my business . the options are endless , the food is amazing and the appetizers are to die for . get the basket of chips with blue cheese . can 't finish them all ? no problem , they keep for days ! fried pickle spears not chips ! great bbq sauce options . the sweet bread is fantastic and the location is perfect .
american	we had the brisket mac and cheese and coleslaw . brisket was tender but definitely not as strong of a smokey flavor as you might expect . coleslaw was meh . kind of watery and not super flavorful . mac and cheese was tasty . really gooey . there are three sauces . i think there could have been more difference between them but all in all they were good . although not the best bbq i have ever had . it 's nice to finally have another bbq option in henderson other than lucille 's .
american	we came for lunch . i pre ordered the rib steak the day before since they do not regularly serve it for lunch . and it was with it . cooked perfectly , and great flavor . the truffle mac and cheese was fantastic as well . i would come back . only a 4 star rating since it does seem like eating in a mall .
american	i can 't really tell you how great the entire menu is because the only thing i ever order is spinach rolls with chicken and marinated slaw . while i 'm always tempted by other offerings , i also resort to my usual , and i 'm never disappointed . well a little disappointed when my plate is empty , but not before . i 'm also a big fan of their limeade and never pass that up either . but the best part of zoe 's is the staff . everyone is so incredibly hospitable . i don 't know where they find employees like that , but i 'm glad they do !
american	yep ! this is our new favorite barbecue place in ne ohio ! service was stellar , too ! the big screens can go---i 'd rather not be distracted from the exquisite experience of flavor exploding in my mouth ! i just want to mindfully meditate on the taste ! mmm mmm mmm . and the best news ! the hudson , ohio , location opens mid-may on rt 91 in the old marcellitas location , halfway between hudson and twinsburg !
american	customer service was excellent the place was clean and even though the place was crowded , i can understand why ... the burgers and fries are mouth watering mmmmm so delicious
american	it 's a new-ish spot located in southend , and i highly recommend it . the staff were extremely friendly , the coffee was amazing , the food looked so good ( i 'll be ordering next time ) , and the place was so cute inside ! i ordered a small skim cappuccino with an extra shot of espresso . this was the first place where i didn 't need to order the extra shot . their espresso was rich and carried itself with a strong and bold flavor . coffee on point !
american	drink service was quick although waitress seemed a bit overworked . food was delicious though . the couches are a tad odd and make for eating " interesting . " will for certain be back . we had the dinghy seafood platter and burrata salad app followed by two of their desserts and a few glasses of bubbly .
american	we got excellent service with warren , and he talked me through what was on the menu , and talked out what was delicious at the restaurant , and let us know that licious was on , so a couple things were taken off the menu . the duck poutine pizza came out piping hot , along with the chicken pot pie . we were very impressed with the level of professionalism , and enthusiasm we had with the o & b hospitality group . we will be back for more food . thank you !
american	that was upsetting , however our waiter irvin was the best waiter i 've had in a long time . turned the whole experience around . thank you irvin , had it not been for you i would have never returned to this location again . plenty of restaurants to eat at in vegas , i wouldn 't have came back but our waiter was great . 5 stars for him
american	the service was still top notch . they have great servers . we shared the grill salad and it was great . they have wonderful crispy crust sour dough bread . we loved the smoked salmon appetizer with a nice sauce on the side we had the blackened ribeye and the brick chicken with a side of their special cauliflower . they were both wonderful . for dessert we split the apple crisp with vanilla ice cream . so glad we tried paul martins again ! thanks everyone for a great experience .
american	i have yet to return to the place , but the manager assured me my experience will be different . since then the server that served me was terminated . looking forward to going again .
american	we have had dinner there with our three kids now a couple of times and the menu is fantastic , every time . we have tried most of the apps and about half of mains and all were tasty . its an eclectic menu with a mix of lots of things , but all done excellently . staff friendly and prompt and you can tell they are all seasoned professionals because of the way they server you . service can be a bit slow when they are extremely busy , but if your not in a rush , enjoy the surroundings and take your time and savour .
american	these were awesome ! ! didn 't eat anything else so can 't comment on that ; however , the drinks were good and they had a good selection of beers .
american	the decor of the place added more fascination and if anything even make me want to order more .. or it might just be me ? the place was crowded but with somewhat good ambiance .. anyway , i tried the " holy smokes " burger from the secret menu and boy was i right ! the burger was cooked just the way i wanted it .. and the kick from the jalapeno peppers fit right in ... the chocolate shake was amazing .. and the fries were unexpectedly a lot ... overall it was a recommendable meal .. price is reasonable for the amount and taste of the food !
american	i will they there is great improvement on the service . our server elizabeth was very good , even with it being her second week . she was very attentive . my only complaint this time was the staff seemed to have trouble locating things ( examples were to go cups and lids for plastic kids cups ) . other than that it was much better than last time service wise . the food on the other hand has not changed which is a great thing . their food is great we have not had a bad thing here . it is definitely worth a visit and chances are you will be hooked on their great food as well !
american	was afraid that close to closing they wouldn 't serve all the meats but got to taste all of them ! the filet was over cooked . roast beef was super tender . the lamb wasn 't gamey . bacon was fatty goodness in my mouth . can 't remember the other meats . the sides were also yummy . many to choose from , although everyone knows the money is in the meat ! overall , great experience , but not for the price tag . glad they were open late though !
american	place looks immaculate and the food is good as usual . good service good people . stop by there people . you won 't think twice next time . thank you arbys
american	we were seated quickly at a table for six people and had prompt , friendly service . we all shared the poutine , short rib bruschetta and chicken artichoke bruschetta . all of our food tasted delicious and the happy hour prices were great .
american	the menu is mostly the same but the bar is mostly gone . since none of us are big drinker , it isn 't a big deal but we were told that the coffee machine was down so there is no greek coffee . the portions for gyro platter and the calamari , plus a lunch portion of chicken pita were extremely large so neither one of us could finished .. it isn 't the greatest middle eastern restaurant but it is decent and the service was friendly . he checked on us several times and see if we are completely satisfied . we got a great value for what we got
american	it was a 15 minute walk from where we were but it was well worth it . everything on the menu looked delicious . the service was fantastic . i had a veggie omelette and it was really well made . my friends also had stunning reviews after the meal . we managed to get in at just the right time because after we left there was a giant line . definitely check this place out if you 're in pittsburgh .
american	the food was good not breath taking . house potatoes were a bit overwhelming with spices ( rosemary i believe ) and had to drench with tapatio for different flavor . eggs , bacon , sausage link and waffle were great . rc cola was there soft drink choice , which was pretty cool to me because you hardy ever see that .
american	clean , big , interesting choices , nice room . they have things like salmon and tuna poke ( a sushi variety ) and incredible meat and fish items . i always try to make it to the bellagio buffet when i 'm in town . a bit pricey but better than a plated dinner and if you skip the optional cocktails you can get a huge dinner for two with top quality food ( crab legs , sushi , prime rib , beef , pasta , killer desserts ) for under $ 90 with tip . i 'd rate it an a .
american	a variety of unique dishes . a dessert bar that has something for everyone . especially loved the chocolate covered strawberry station . crab legs and lobster tail to your hearts content . a little pricey but i 'd prefer spending that $ 20 or $ 30 more to eat here rather than the buffets at the other casinos .
american	the boom boom sauce was the perfect amount of spice when coupled with the bed of slaw cradling the shrimp ! the waitress was outstanding and very attentive . the quality of food and service is the same excellence we see at the quaker steak back home ! great job !
american	truly great food ( had the omelet and other signature stuff ) , friendly servers , and well , the waiting line was not that long - or perhaps i just made a right decision to go early in this regard .
american	this is where kevin & i went for his 15th birthday . he had wings and sweet potato fries .. and coke of course . i had steak salad and a sangria . we both loved our meals . they brought kevin a mini brownie for his bd and i got a mini dessert as well . both were larger than expected and served with ice cream . delicious ! all of the staff were really nice , friendly , and efficient .
american	this place is like campbell 's soup good mmmm mmm mmmm . i had country breakfast plate eggs and bacon cooked perfect . don 't judge but also had blueberry pancakes . my gf had the blue plate omelet ( the yummy one with avacados ) . i can 't say enough how great the food and service was . love great diner 's like this .
american	i keep trying other places but cannot find a closer alternative . the best blubbery and chocolate chip pancakes anywhere and the oj is amazing . best combination of sweet and cold . service is alway fast and friendly .
american	parking is in a structure and would cost money , be sure to get a voucher ! it 's great . the food was as expected and of good quality . to put it in perspective , i felt like i had been hit by a train from the night before and was willing to really eat anything . but , i was willing to eat at mto cafe . i got the scramble and it was nice and substantial . decently priced and you get what you ask for . the staff was quite friendly and patient to our slow thought process on the day . and the parking voucher was big kudo points . he handed it to us without even having to ask .
american	big portions , cheap and awesome ! the pancakes were big and fluffy and the biscuits and gravy were amazing ! i wished i had room to try a piece of the cake or pie in the display case - seriously , if they do biscuits that good , what must their desserts be like ? ! next time , i guess . because i will be back the next time i am in vegas !
american	i had the bahn mi , then the veggie gyro , then a burrito . all were a large portion with excellent fresh ingredients at a price that was really really great . my significant other is addicted to the chili , which actually has a good heat level . also the milkshakes are to die for . can 't get enough of them . service is prompt and attentive . the waitstaff is knowledgeable and friendly . service is quick even when they are busy . this is the perfect casual restaurant . the decor is funky and cool . there is even a pinball machine ! will return again and again i am sure .
american	i 've only had the wings and fried macaroni bites , but i 've enjoyed them every time . the wings were large and cooked well . the flavours i 've tried were honey garlic , bbq and honey mustard . it 's a small , clean spot with a few tables for dining in . i recommend it if you 're in the mood for wings .
american	why did i come here out of all the other excellent steak houses on the las vegas strip ? 1 reason : truffle parmesan potato chips. they are like crack , you simply can 't stop eating them : ) i ordered the certified piedmontese steak , ny strip steak ( $ 60 ) , grilled in olive oil , sea salt , roasted garlic and rosemary . at 16 ounces , each tender bite was worth every dollar . girlfriend ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup and said it was very good . service is impeccable with a three person staff dedicated to your table and they make your experience worth the high price tag that is at delmoncio !
american	it was just as good as last time . the caesar salad is my absolute favorite . our dinners were superb . the prices are very reasonable for vegas . all in all a wonderful experience . we 'll be back .
american	the highlights ... chicken had awesome flavor . gravy tasted great coffee was great blueberry pie was amazingly good ! the cons ... chicken was dry .. thank god there was gravy the dressing was too moist cornbread was adequate . my recommendation ... scout the large menu and choose from homemade items and specials . i think that 's the best bet to be pleased here . i 'll be back .
american	the food is excellent and the prices are reasonable and the dude at the counter keeps the line moving ; i had the delicious philly cheese steak wrapped in a gyro and topped with onions , greenpeppers and cheese ( not that horid cheese whiz ) . their gyros and greek salads are tasty as well . get there early because the place gets so crowded and tables are at a premium . it 's like trying to cram 10 pounds of stuff into a 5 pound bag .
american	so we went out for an extremely late dinner .. as soon as we arrived we sat ourselves down and waited for a server , surprisingly our server doug greated us within seconds of us arriving .. and it was all great after that ! ! ! since the menu was quite large and i have a decission making issues he helped us pick and choose our app and dinner plates , and i gotta say it was all really good . thanks rivertowne ! ! this is a review from 1 to 2 years ago
american	it 's kind of out-of-place , and kind of expensive , but the sandwiches are pretty big and well-loaded . i got a philly with provolone ( sorry , i just can 't do the cheese-whiz thing .. i know , i know , but i 'll take my non-authentic philly any day , thanks ) , red peppers and onions and it was delicious . just the right level of greasiness , and i actually finished the whole thing .... guh ! but i didn 't even feel ill . the fries were also really good . i 'd definitely go back .
american	excellent service , and the monday specials . the burgers - cheese curds & tots were on point .
american	there was a special posted for 1 / 2 turkey or ham sandwich with your choice of chicken noodle soup , ceasar salad or mushroom soup for $ 7.99 . i opted for the 1 / 2 turkey sandwich with chicken noodle soup . this was very tasty and the server erendira was great .
american	dinner was great , service was on point and our server found us a $ 10 off coupon , score ! thanks cpk for great service .
american	after passing an endless array of fast food joints and businessman-only haunts , we came across redbeard 's , which seemed to target us a bit better . two words on the menu indicated to me we had made the right decision : italian quesadilla , which was as good and interesting as it sounds . wife had a hamburger and fries , and combined with our drinks , found that we really didn 't need to eat for the rest of the day , yet at the same time the meal didn 't exhaust us .
american	we were surprised by what we found here . the food is overall pretty good and the service is much better than any other buffet we tried ( including the more expensive ones ) ... paris is a small , big hotel , in that it 's just the right size and is comfortable vs getting lost and walking 10 miles inside to find anything ...
american	it isn 't overpriced considering how fancy the cosmopolitan is in general and the quality of the food is just amazing . this buffet knows the beauty of portion control and that alone is worth the experience ... rather than set up the food in mountains of food like other places , the food is plated in the perfect sized portions ! even the water they brought to the table was super crisp and palette cleansing . the waitress we had was very attentive and never let our glasses get empty . for the price , this place is worth every penny . it 's kind of hidden in the cosmo , but its worth the hunt . perfection !
american	service unlike any other , they make the bellagio service seem like diner food . the food , creative , delicate and sooooooooooo tasty and cooked to perfection . i knew when we had the appetizers that we were in for a treat of a lifetime .
american	service was excellent . steak was awesome and the desert was also great . generous drinks pours also helped . easiest 5 start review ever !
american	simply the best bbq in town , the sides and the seafood are great too ! ! ! do yourself a favor , and treat yourself ! ! ! bring your family , bring your friends , hell , bring everyone ! ! ! i guarantee you will love it ! ! ! ( i posted some of my food pictures here , so check it out ! )
american	i love to make one with the special fries , blue cheese , braised beef , and pepper sauce ! the service is great every time i go .
american	for that , i needed to update my review to 5 stars . wish they had one of these in the burgh- i 'm still dreaming about that bahn mi burger ! !
american	it doesn 't matter what time of day you go , their food is totally worth the money your paying for and the consitency is there . i hope the next time we come back this summer , their creme brulee has improved .
american	we want to check out the vegas location . i ordered the cheese burger with bacon and pepper ... been craving for that salty flavor burger . line was quick when ordering . will definitely be back .
american	nice atmosphere indoors and outdoors . we really enjoyed sitting outside on nice evening . i got the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw ( yummy ! ) and my boyfriend got the two meat combo 1 / 2lb of beef brisket and pulled pork with baked potato salad and the brisket chili . both meats were delicious and i loved the potato salad the best and he loved the chili . the service was fast too . you won 't be disappointed !
american	had the 4 bone rib meal with sweet corn medley and potato salad , and it was all delicious . the ribs literaly melted in my mouth and weren 't smothered in sauce like some other places . the service was super warm and friendly as well . i will definitely be back ! this place is only open mon-fri 10 : 30-3 : 00 . the place gets crowded for lunch . get here right when they open or after the lunch hour .
american	while i was hesitant because of the ratings , we were seeing a show at planet hollywood and decided to give it a go as unlimited drinks were included . i 'm so glad we did ! if you like seafood it 's well worth it . the staff aren 't very amicable but the crab legs are great and the beer is flowing . i actually recommend this buffet over the bellagio !
american	not taking reservations is always a little annoying and i ended up waiting an hour for a table of four around 5 on a saturday . once we were seated the service was speedy and the menu was great . we ordered the poutine , mac and cheese , surf and turf and lobster roll . the portions were enough to give you a great taste but if i went back i 'd be sure to get some appetizers . decent selection of beer and loved the decor . this place is very toronto right now .
american	well they finally opened up in henderson near my friends house , i decide to give them another go . i ordered a cheeseburger with lettuce , tomato and grilled onions like i do at in-n-out . the burger was good like a homemade burger but was missing something like more seasoning on the patties . overall a good burger but needs work and a closer location to my house .
american	love the potatoes and banana nut muffin with my breakfast !
american	can 't say enough about this place . go ! have breakfast or lunch you won 't be disappointed . i promise . the place is fun the service excellent and the food is oh so yummy ! !
american	and after eating i can see why they 're always so slammed on the weekends . the restaurant is cute , the staff is friendly , and the food is banging . i got the challah french toast at the suggestion of our waiter which has berries , fig jam , and brie and it was so effing good . next time i 'm getting the four cheese omelette . also i got a side of sausage and it tasted like sweet meatballs . i want more . they have commonplace coffee and its so good . this place definitely lives up to the hype and you get a lot of food for your buck .
american	the fried chicken was amazing , and the homemade iced tea and lime-aid were nice too . just don 't expect to have the normal restaurant experience , just get it to go , wynchwood bards is just around the corner . i will definitely have to make my mom try this place out for the fried chicken .
american	the line was long but moved fast . the server quickly came to take our order and in no time we had our drinks ... some oj & water . the water tasted like it came from tap ... talk about tasting nasty ... our food came quickly . even though the menu is high in price the portions are decent , the service is great , and the food is tasty . the clean up crew is also awesome . they move quickly and start cleaning right after a table is finished . it makes it more pleasant for customers to sit around clean tables & cuts their wait time .
american	i was really impressed and the wait was about 3 mins until we got our food . only downfall was the loud music inside . i 'd recommend this place if you are looking for a good burger or chicken sandwich .
american	menu is full of all the traditional breakfast favorites and has a special section for items with a higher lever of protein . we ordered the protein pancake ( which was really tasty ... bit of a cinnamon flavor ) and the spinach omelette . both were very good .... and just the right amount . atmosphere is somewhat uneventful , but the food and service are very good .
american	they took us right in . i thought , maybe the food is not good or something . the prices are a little high , but this is a high end place . they had fries so my 6 year old was happy . the waiter was excellent ! he understood kids . my husband had lobster bisque and i had the mushroom salad - both were excellently prepared . we shared the double breast of chicken . wow , two big portions for both of us . we paid 60 - the same we would have paid at either of the other restaurants , but we got right in , had a great waiter and great food . i will go here again !
american	i had the kansas strip , and my wife had a filet . both were done to perfection . salids were fantastic . and don 't forget , you must have the hashbrowns . i want to go back for more .
american	this place was wonderful . fantastic , friendly , service . light , crispy waffles -- absolutely perfect . breakfast special comes with unlimited coffee . great overall experience . so nice to support a local , family business . * * * * word of warning : waffles comes with a massive dollop of butter . i loved it but if you wouldn 't -- make sure to tell them when you order .
american	not only is the food delicious and the beer selection is awesome , but the atmosphere is very appealing. the management does a wonderful job making sure the customer gets what they want . i have two awesome experiences and hope to enjoy similiars ones in the future .
american	upon taking my first bite of my cheeseburger , i immediately noticed that it was much better than the burgers i had at york mills . i give the ones i had before a 2.5 / 5 but this one was a solid 4 / 5 . it actually tasted fresh and juicy . even the fries here taste better . they had some potato skin on them and were hot and satisfying . i didn 't feel like i got my money 's worth before but the experience with this location makes me more willing to pay $ 8-9 for a burger . good , fast and friendly service too .
american	nestled in the back of the four queens , where we were staying , we found beer and pizza ... what a great combination . and this wasn 't just any pizza , this was chicago-style thin crust , my favorite ! the pizza and garlic knots were both delicious ! i also ordered a sampler flight of beer , which came with eight different beers and a sample of their root beer as well . i was definitely impressed as was the rest of my party . i 'll definitely return next time i 'm in town !
american	next step is going for dinner . i 'd recommend bouillon bilk to anyone who considers them self a foodie .
american	the space is giant , with lots of tables , 6 seater high tops , and bar space . they have an extensive menu that includes options that are not fried , which is a welcome alternative to traditional bar food . i recommend trying one of the lavosh pizzas , the bruscetta variety was delicious without feeling too heavy ! though don 't be alarmed they have all kinds of yummy indulgent stuff as well to soak up the liquor , er , i mean diet coke : ) ! but as far as liquor and beer go , there 's plenty flowing , and they have my favorite , blue moon ! definitely check this out ! !
american	i loved their restaurant in brooklyn and am glad quality has not suffered with a busier location . their current focus is local sourced ingredients served ' farm style ' . the food truly reminds me of meals my grandma made for me .
american	salads were great and we will definitely stop by again to try the baby back ribs ! highly recommended !
american	i was wearing my chicago cubs t-shirt and lady hostess greeting with a nice friendly greeting and said they were good like the chicago gyros . we both had the gyro sandwich and they were great . loaded , heaping with gyro meat and great tziki sauce . ( spelling ? ) . anyway , they came several times to check on us , asked how we liked it and genuinely seemed pleased to serve us . very reasonably priced . they said they originally came from a chicago and pride themselves on having the same quality products . very pleased and will definitely return .
american	my husband and i both ordered the special - a grilled chicken sandwich on fresh focaccia with mayo , apples , onions , and pickled zucchini . great mix of favors . the onion rings were outstanding ! it was easy to get a table since the lunch hour had passed . service was prompt & friendly .
american	visiting vegas for an aau basketball tourney . we came across this spot and got excited . i must say this spot is pretty official . the beef and the au jus is spot on and the peppers combo are spicy forming a perfect combination . if you are in that area you need hit that spot if you can 't make it to chicago .
american	i really have never been much of a brunch person , but lucky 's has converted me ! after digging into some of the homemade granola , i knew that i was in heaven . it was light and fresh , the perfect way to start my morning . they had great fresh squeezed oj and the coffee was excellent . i would definitely recommend to anyone visiting cleveland !
american	jamm 's is unpretentious , unassuming , honest-to-goodness mom ' n ' pop little joint ( the complete opposite of hash house ) . service is fast and friendly and they treat you like family ( they were really accommodating to my husband 's request for hard boiled eggs ) . the food was good solid diner fare . we ordered the eggs benedict , the chicken fried steak and eggs , and a side of corned beef hash . everything was good , but we loved loved loved the house fries and the corned beef hash ( which was perfected seasoned and lightly crisped ) . food was reasonably priced and portions were very generous . will return if in the area again !
american	the food was delicious . the meat falling of the bones on the ribs , wow . the service that dee gave was amazing . she made us feel comfortable and welcome . highly recommend this place and will be coming back when in vegas .
american	what a pleasant surprise . the food was great and the prices were even better . i had the beef burger and it was one of the best hamburgers i 've ever had . moist and very tasty . hubby had the chorizo burrito and loved it . the staff was very accommodating and friendly and we appreciated the staff coming over to talk with us . small place but worth every penny . $ 6.00 breakfast & & $ 7.00 for lunch . definitely a place you should try . the restaurant is a non-profit organization and provides food to needy families on a regular basis . it 's wonderful to have a great meal and do something for the community also . great food .
american	the greek pita hit the spot ! we had hummus and gyros - yum ! hummus was flavorful , and the meat was tastey . the pita was a little stiff , but that was the only complaint . next time we 're in the area , we 'll stop here for quick eats !
american	went here one day and the whole family got the pulled pork burger . i must say i quite enjoyed my meal here ! juicy and not dry and this place had a great grungy feel that bbq places should have . i 'm surprised i haven 't heard more buzz about this place ! give it a go !
american	ever ... i 'm not sure how the people out there do it . but , the mimosas , our host and stellar server , jo , at marston 's made our morning memorable ! the food was good and the service was excellent . it was maybe the best part of our short trip to az .
american	last year we had tried to eat at one in dublin , ca but the wait was too long , now i know why . i had the chicken pot pie , fantastic and so was the service and atmosphere . we don 't have a lazy dog in san luis obispo but until we do will search them out when traveling .
american	roscoes , still wins on chicken in my opinion though .
american	sunrise definitely proved me wrong . keep the creme brulee latte in mind when you visit . my absolute favorite ! and if you 're hungry , the alien burrito is definitely the way to go . this place has got to be , without a doubt , the best in town . it 's so relaxing , and it 's got this personality that 's just so inviting , you 'd be a fool for not wanting to give it a try .
american	first off , very welcoming environment with nice seating and fairly quiet . the service was great as my waitress was very attentive but not overly so . the food was very tasty although the fries could have used a tad bit if seasoning . the beers were tasty and i enjoyed the majority of the ones i 've tried . i would definitely come back here again .
american	the bun was freshly made and nice and warm . the patty was amazing .... melted in your mouth . my wife who barely eats meat and doesn 't like burgers even loved it and commented that that 's one burger she could eat regularly . too bad theres nothing like this here in seattle . we 'll be back some day to try others .
american	i ordered the famous chicken and waffles with hot sauce and syrup on the side . the fried chicken was breaded perfectly and was the perfect crunch factor . the waffle on the other hand was the perfect sweetness and paired so well with the fried chicken . i am so happy that i decided to stop back !
american	unfortunately , it started raining , otherwise we would 've sat in their nice outdoor patio . the food was very delicious and the presentation was outstanding . the ambience is very chic , and family friendly . most of the customers are hotel guests and there 's direct indoor access to subway from the hotel .
american	i had the meatloaf dinner , which believe it or comes with a ton of food . in addition to two hearty portions of meatloaf , it came with mashed potatoes , corn , fresh cornbread and ice cream ... all included ! you also have the option to add a soup or salad for $ 1.50 , which i opted for . this place is cooking up some of the best country cooking and if you don 't visit , then you are doing yourself a disservice .
american	burgers were great and cole slaw exceptional . philly sandwich was very tasteful . service was good . an unusual scenario happened when we left for las vegas after dining . i found that i forgot my purse and left it in this restaurant . we called back after we discover this and they said that they had the purse well kept waiting for us to return . we expressed our sincere appreciation and gratitude to the staff there . we are over-joyed by this lost-and-found experience and will definitely visit this restaurant again when we will have our next trip to las vegas .
american	whenever i 'm craving fish and chips this is my go to shop . their sweet potato fries are the best i 've ever had , the service is wonderful and friendly every time and even though the extra crispy ms vickie 's coating may seem superfluous , the flavor and the crunch have me hooked . i love that they have plenty of options ( including several vegetarian ones ! ) on their menu without detracting from the quality of their main draw , the fish and chips .
american	the service was fantastic and the chicken and waffles were perfect . looking forward to visiting again soon .
american	horeb for a quick bite to eat . the people at this restaurant were fabulous ! it was crowded , but we got our food and drinks relatively quick , and we thought everything was fairly good . i don 't necessarily recommend the food , it 's just standard pub fare , but the pretzel and the beer i do recommend !
american	the service has been great , and the food has been consistently better than before . now really my only complaint is the three pages of rules that govern their frequent diners card . every other place i eat at often you get a stamp per entree you purchase , and you can combine cards . the good egg is a little more picky , and only gives one stamp per visit , and you cannot combine cards .
american	i had a plate of scrambled eggs , with bacon , sausage , potatoes , and a couple of french toasts that tasted like the ones my mom used to prepare for me when i was a kid . i 'm a breakfast lover , and i liked this place , so i will keep coming , trying other different dishes . i will definitely recommend this to friends .
american	love the variety of their menu , and loved everything i tried here so far ! my favorite right now are the beef satays and the pizzas . i love that the salad is fresh , and the burger was exactly how i desired it . great fries too ! overall wonderful ! and the employees are very helpful and friendly . happy hour is great at this place !
american	service was great and friendly , truffle frites and taleggio ravioli to die for . blueberry pie was great too . best fries in the city , which forced me to go back yet again for a quick lunch - chicken noodle soup is boring , so skip it .
american	the gentleman who took our order was courteous and we received our order and walked out within 5 minutes . thank you mcdonald 's for actually doing the jobs you were hired to do !
american	although we have an egg slut here in la i 've never really had the chance to try it . this was the best breakfast i 've had in vegas . you will definitely be full for the entire day . my boyfriend had the egg , bacon with cheese sandwich and i had the bacon sausage cheese and egg sandwich . i will for sure go to the la location .
american	oysters three ways- gorgeous . piglet risotto : delicious . snowcrab salad : skip . duck breast with fois gras : amazing chasse et peche ( lobster and kobe steak ) - incredible , well worth $ 50 sucking pig- nice , salty , wouldn 't repeat. not bad . didn 't try the hamachi , person seemed to enjoy it desert- one tasted like chocolate play doh with vanilla jello pudding , the other seemed ok . wine was great , service great . in all , i would say stick to the meat and definitely go for the surf and turf . will go back but i won 't order desert : )
american	great kitchen ! did order a honey garlic sirloin with mushrooms . it was very good . everything was joke with this plate . the cappuccino afterwards could be a bit bigger . the waitress was also nice and the beer was good . will try the moxie 's grill & bar chain more often .
american	my husband dines here each month when he is visiting cleveland for business , so i had heard about the delicious food . upon entering , i loved the decor----bikes hanging on the walls ? pretty cool . even the restrooms were unique . anyhow , the staff was very helpful and attentive . the cocktails were fantastic . i tried one that was on the specials list , and it was creative and balanced . the animal frites are best enjoyed as a half portion .... as they are huge , delicious , rich , and a big bowl of goodness ! the lamb burger and wings ( my favorite item of the night ) were also dynamic . cannot wait to return !
american	i have never been to a rudy 's location that i didn 't like this one included . if you have never been to a rudy 's before then i highly recommend you try it . if you are looking for a fine dining experience then this is not the place for you . rudy 's is a place for families to get together and enjoy some good bbq in a family style , self serve setting . the brisket is succulent , the chicken is delish , and the sauce is the boss ! ! !
american	i do have to say that everything was fresh and everything tasted great ... but ... it 's breakfast . i know that big chains can somehow screw it up , but for the most part , it 's not that difficult to pull off . this is one of the better places i 've had breakfast ... maybe it was the hype , maybe the wait in the cold rain , or maybe it was just the food . was it worth waiting in the rain for an hour ? no . was it worth waiting an hour without the rain ? no . was it some tasty breakfast ? yes .
american	unbelievable food . i mean better than i 've had in years . the ambience was sexy , yet casual . the quinoa is beyond expectations and the kale flatbread was also perfect . it was all a ten ! excellent ! ! ! !
american	it was after 2 pm , so no idea how things are during peak times . i liked the atmosphere , although the ac was at arctic levels . i enjoyed my food and drink , but since i was traveling , i just got a sampler of the altercation ( a good compromise between light and dark ) , and the spinach salad ( enjoyed the maple bacon dressing ) and the cuban pork . recommended stop in downtown champaign - in the large condo tower on neil in downtown . there 's a gigantic parking deck behind it , or metered parking in the city lot across the street , where there are 2 zipcars stationed . good move , champaign .
american	on the way back we were super hungry and ran into this place . it was like 9 : 30 in the morning and we were looking for a place with great breakfast . this was the place . the food was great , and even better they had $ 3 pints of beer ! yes , i know it wasn 't after 5pm but its vegas who gives a crap . this was a great place to start our sunday morning . although too bad the cardinals didn 't win . so if you are ever walking down the strip hungry , stop by this cafe you will be extremely happy you did .
american	my girlfriends and i walked around the whole mirage hotel looking for a restaurant to serve breakfast . finally , we found carnegie deli that served breakfast all day ! dying of hunger , the service was quick and efficient . we were sat and a server came to us right away . i got the basic eggs and bacon , the portion was more then enough . my friends and i were more then satisfied that we came back the next morning to have breakfast . none of us had the pastrami sandwich , but it looked ginormous ! i 'll have to go to nyc for that !
american	white pudding and feta balls for me followed by the kitchen fish pie , accompanied by a glass of black isle organic red kite ale . a pleasant evening relaxing .
american	stopped in and was not disappointed . everything was made fresh , they use fresh seasonal fruit which was excellent . if there were any negatives our waitress was not very attentive , however we did notice the other tables did not have the same issue with their waitresses . also the white sangria was not the greatest but overall we would definitely come back if in the area again . if you are looking for something different , delicious , and freshly made then this is your place .
american	the best service out there , the wait was about 15 mins during heavy volumes , but the service once you sat down was top notch . then the pizzas come out and you know you will be back soon . thank to the cooks and staff ... well done .
american	great location on the strip and perfect for people watching . we were seated on the patio and glanced over the menu . i knew exactly what i wanted , just basic breakfast with eggs , sausage , hash browns and toast . so simple , yet so hard to find in vegas . brian went with the lox and bagel . the service was not the best , but wasn 't horrible . overall , it was priced well , especially for the strip , and the food was really good .
american	while my friends were a little put off by the simplicity of the menu , sometimes it is better to do a few things quite well . our server , david , approached us with a no-nonsense advice of someone who read us as out of towners . again , put off my friends . i took his recommendation of the berry cooler and the philly cheesesteak burger . it was everything he promised . i also took his recommendation to add a little horseradish to the burger . exquisite .
american	i 'm certain that the restaurant & the roof deck are worth checking out , but that was just not what we felt up to doing . the bartender was extremely friendly -- offering up advice about the canadian brews . he convinced hubby to try a moosehead ( or moose juice as he called it ) -- not my kind of beer , but still had that crisp canadian beer taste to it . the bar was a comfortable atmosphere & pretty quiet for a sunday night on a long weekend ... but the service was personal & they had the pats pregame on one of their big screen tvs ( def. a plus ! ) .
american	one because it was newer than a lot of the establishments , plenty of seating and had air conditioning . you order at the counter and they bring your meal to you . we split # 4 the bearcat and poutine fries . burger was quite messy . had to fork and knife it but oh so much flavor . this was my first time eating poutine fries and won 't be my last . a very calorie indulgent meal but all worth it .
american	: ) it was made is a juicy way mouth-watering delicious . ( he said ) the burger was perfectly prepared with fresh ground beef , toppings with onion rings and baby crunchy fries . i did not have much since the breakfast still hunting me , but my brussels sprouts was prepared in the way unforgettable good . the sever keeps coming back for my hot h2o with lemon ( i don 't drink cold ) it was a simple but very delicious lunch in new york !
american	the food was delicious , and nice sized portions for the affordable prices . our service was wonderful ; penny was our waitress and made sure our drinks were never empty . i highly recommend the lil ' johnny stuffing sandwich , which was a melt-in-your-mouth artwork of a sandwich !
american	looking for something somewhat healthy , cheap and fast we found earl of sandwich on the yelp app and were thrilled . they offer a wise variety of sandwiches , wraps and salads for a great price and also provide plenty of seating ! while it definitely wasn 't the best sandwich i 've ever had , they gave us exactly what we were looking for and it totally it the spot . if you are looking for a low-cost meal on the strip , earl of sandwich is definitely where it 's at ! thanks yelp !
american	what a stroke of luck ! we loved the breads and shared a yummy caesar salad before our entrees came . my husband ordered the lasagna which was sooo good and i ordered the fettuccine alfredo with grill chicken which was really delicious too . the portions were very generous , i could only eat half if mine and my husband left some of his meal too . no room for dessert but we were both glad we had stumbled upon this great eating spot and will definitely come back . the prices were really reasonable and the restaurant was very nicely decorated , and the waiter ( bill ) was very attentive . i am already looking forward to our next visit .
american	as someone who hates waiting in long lines for food , i would definitely recommend visiting short stack for dinner to avoid the wait . the ordering process is quite unique in that you order and pay for your food before having a seat . i decided to order the blind special , which is a great option if you are looking for a breakfast surprise and discount !
american	we opted for a booth to avoid the traffic flow outside the place and people fresh off their highs from the oxygen bar around the corner . food was excellent ( we both had the carbonara ) , portions were generous , and service was amicable and sincere - from the host to the server to the multiple staff members that thanked us on our way out . definitely an experience we 'd repeat .
american	the burger was excellent and it was so big i couldn 't eat it all . the onion rings were too too . i definitely recommend this place .
american	i ordered the buffalo chicken cheesesteak and my friend ordered the original philly . both were quite tasty . the fries were thicker than normal but were cooked to a nice and crunchy golden color . the staff was friendly and the place was quite busy although does not have much indoor seating for larger groups . i will probably go back if i 'm in the area .
american	pepper / mountain dew drinker , we wondered into this little place . they had both ! so we stayed to eat . not expecting much , we only ordered burgers and fries . they were delicious ! ! ! fries were perfect . crispy and seasoned perfectly . the burgers were hot and juicy . buns were lightly toasted . all around just wonderful . wish we had this little place in our hometown . if you 're in boulder city eat here ! ! very friendly service too ! !
american	boom . great call . efficient , friendly service and they get the order precisely right . no pseudo-fake , " get out of my way i have 4 corned beef sandwiches to serve " attitude like you get at slyman 's . i think danny 's ' has a better selection anyway . their onion rings are good ( my # 1 vote will always go to johnny 's little bar ) . i got the danny 's club . i wish i would have gotten it toasted . bummer ... next time . hole-in-the-wall deli that should be in heavy rotation on everyone 's lunchtime eats list .
american	after such a bad experience only 20 minutes before we were pleased to be greeted by the hostess with such politeness and willingness to help . before we sat down we wanted to confirm that their veggie burger was vegan , which is was . yeah ! the menu is a bit overwhelming for a first timer , but it 's also exciting . the server explained to us our options for substitutions to build our perfect vegan burgers . the atmosphere was pleasant and the place was clean and fun to look at . the burgers tasted good , as did the fries . the price was pretty good to for the hardy sized burger . i would recommend eating at this place .
american	as soon as we sat down at the bar we had coasters and menus being placed in front of us from jeff . very welcoming at that . the remainder of the time at the restaurant we enjoyed his company and his phenomenal service . the food was amazing however , his great service alone will bring my family back to the angry crab .
american	great idea . no wait , and no hurry . the pancakes were excellent .. light , fluffy , and perfect . the omelet with chorizo ? horrid , but i blame myself . what was i thinking ? like ordering oysters in iowa . good cup of diner coffee , and counter service was great . kids want to know when we 're coming back ... soon !
american	made excellent customer service as well as personal preference on meals and introduced me to the gyro meat ! would definitely recommend coming here to try it out .
american	it was actually much better than some of the expensive places we had . slices are about 5 $ and are quite large . we had a slice of cheese , pepperoni , and white w / ricotta . the pepperoni was great , they were spicy and flavorful . the cheese was not so great . the white was really good , very garlicky . this place is a great find on the strip ! i 'd go back for sure .
american	i had the chicken and waffles and it was great. the service was awesome and we didn 't wait at all ( i 'm assuming because we came on saturday around 9 am and everyone is still knocked out and / or hung over ) . the only thing i would recommend is take your car ! ! ! we realized we forgot our valet ticket and were too lazy and hungover / drunk to go back upstairs so we taxied it .... round trip $ 45 ! ! ! ! next time i will definitely drive there and enjoy their delish food again : )
american	i enjoyed the tuna burger and couldn 't decide between the shrimp chips or the fry , so they gave me 1 / 2 & 1 / 2 . the tuna burger was amazing ! cooked to perfection and served on a rice bun , clever . the fries were good , but i would have liked a little more salt / seasoning . and , the shrimp chips , an interesting side ! although i loved the meal , i was surprised to pay $ 20 for a burger and soda , a little high for an everyday lunch .
american	the restaurant while small is very nicely decorated and while the tables are close together that does not bother me . we got the wedge salad and split it- it was very large and very tasty ! we also ordered the meat & potatoes for 2 . it was a tomahawk ribeye . while it was very tasty it had quite a bit of fat and didn 't have as much flavor as i was expecting . i saw quite a few other dishes going out that looked fantastic so i will be sure to try one of those the next time !
american	the curried lentil and apricot soup was the clear winner of everything we tried . we also tried the veggie wrap , pork wrap , and corn bisque .
american	after going to the other location and waiting 20 minutes with nobody greeting us we decided to get up & give the other location a try .. the food was awesome , we got pizza , buffalo dip and fries all of it was bomb ! our server was trying her hardest but they could definitely use another server .. will probably come back to this location but i would probably order it to go next time .
american	our server , jordan , was awesome ! she was so super friendly , explained the menu and specials . i ordered the brisket sandwich with nacho cheese with on it & homemade chips and the hubs got the brisket ruben with fries . everything was so delicious . i can 't wait to come back and try some other items . we 're new customers for a long time to come .
american	when we went to the beer engine last night , i tried theirs , which had roasted red peppers , onions , and provolone cheese . it was fantastic ! very surprised . the bread was soft but not soggy . there was a lot of flavor , and the meat was extremely tender . although i was really craving cheez-whiz on my sandwich , the provolone gave me the opportunity not to feel nauseated afterwards . thanks , beer engine !
american	after finally making it to pittsburgh it was the first place we tried ! i had the jumbot ( the mix of potatoes , eggs , ham. peppers , onion and cheese etc ) it was great and hit the spot perfect with a pumpkin pancake ! the coffee was hot , the service was friendly and quick , and very attentive ! great start to our trip to pittsburgh !
american	when i saw it on the strip i had to go there . this place is the bomb ! their shrimp shack pasta is my favorite dish ; it has tangy , buttery sauce over a bed of penne , tomatoes , and shrimp . the workers also play forrest gump trivia with you . it 's quite amusing ! if you get all the questions right , you get some sort of prize . when i went to the one in san francisco , they gave us free parking . i live in seattle , i wish i could take this place back home with me . it 's a bit pricey , but you get what you pay for !
american	and oh-my-gawd ... the food and the portion could easily feed a village . the entrees were enormous ( 3 people barely finished 1 ! ! ! ) , and the flavors were just as bold . i now understand why adam looked like he died and gone to heaven , because the twisted food was beyond amazing . ordering andy 's sage fried chicken benedict was a no brainer since it was the focal point on adam 's trip . and boy , it was nothing short of steller . the nutty corn-flake breading and thick creamy gravy over the bed of mashed potatoes and buttery biscuit was lethal . it belongs in it 's own category . deadly , but totally worth it !
american	~ 30 waiting during the holidays . to start i had the smore 's mocha , after that you need no dessert . also tried the watermelon lemonade which wasn 't great but was pretty good . tried andy 's sage fried chicken and was delicious , the chipotle sauce made it great . also tried the hamburger , which was " normal . " big portions , share ! ! total we ended up paying $ 47 . good service . planning on coming back again ! !
american	well i have no doubt now , the new restaurant at the tropicana has great food , friendly wait staff and pretty reasonable price . our waiter jovanny 's menu knowledge guided us to the best dishes . lisa the runner made sure everything was to our liking and that we were happy with our meal . i was very impressed and can 't wait to return .
american	i have to say the food wa excellent and our server was good too
american	we decided on mostly the same sandwich all around which was the pitts-burgher cheese steak and their signature fries . we were not disappointed at all with the meal as it was tasty and delicious , although we may have needed two to fill us up ! i 'm usually not one for cole slaw or tomatoes but my sandwich alone was delicious enough to eat the entire thing !
american	sat at the bar and had a ice cold beer served in an ice cold glass . the butternut and white cheese enchiladas were absolutely amazing and the cucumber salad that accompanies it was very refreshing . vanessa the bartender was very attentive . it was a perfect end to a perfect evening ! !
american	they have decadent pancakes ( red velvet , cinnabon , s 'mores ) , or if you 're feeling lighter , a make your own omelet option complete with a choice of whole eggs or egg whites. you won 't regret it !
american	so burger bar it was . we went around 8 : 30 on a saturday night and it took about 40 minutes to be seated ( they give you pagers so you can shop in the area if you 'd like ) . j ordered the blackjack burger ( with tapenade ) and i got the hot dog sausage ( hebrew national ! ) although i couldn 't have the sauerkraut because it had bacon in it . the burgers / dogs was really good and the fries were great too . we didn 't try any desserts but they seemed interesting enough . now all i got to do is save my pennies and make a trip to san fran ....
american	so , taste it tours caught our attention . great way to have a different type of dinner experience it was terrific . we tried delicious food and drink at five spots and learned about phoenix history as well . if we lived in phoenix , we would definitely go back to the restaurnats we visited--they were well selected . and of course , jessica , the owner is delightful . personable and knowledgeable . not to be missed .
american	i have no idea why we waited so long ... it was one of the most enjoyable breakfasts i have had in a long time . i sort of built my own eggs benedict and was pleasantly surprised by the hollandaise sauce that came with it ! the hash brown patties were perfectly crisp ( side order ) and the coffee was quality . great " default " breakfast / brunch place ! very casual demeanor and the staff is so pleasant . our server was amanda ; she was great ! will definitely be going back soon for breakfast , and will more than likely stop in for lunch !
american	we happened upon brownstone which had a buzzing patio and 5 empty seats at the bar . looking around , i could see that the restaurant was very modern and displayed great at work . we were greeted by very friendly staff despite it being very close to closing time . we were served our drinks immediately and with style . one of the guests in our party didn 't enjoy their drink , and the staff were kind enough not to charge for it . overall i 'd come back , especially for the recommended brunch !
american	" followed by " that was good . " this came from a man who considers " it was okay " high praise . i had fish with calamari and hubby had fish . we both substituted clam chowder for the fries - well worth the $ 2 up charge . coleslaw also came with . the food was great . the crew was friendly . the music was pleasing and not too loud . the tvs were tuned to sports ( no establishment should ever be tuned to news ) . the restaurant was very clean . what more could you ask for ?
american	i was craving a fat burger , so i opted for an order of fries and a smokehouse burger from johnny rockets , and oh . my . goodness . soooo smack . smoked bacon , sourdough onion rings , cheddar cheese , barbecue ranch sauce ... what more could you ever ask for in a burger ? i don 't even like bacon , but i happily scarfed this down with zero regrets . the fries hit the spot as well . only negative is , my food came out warm , not hot .
american	so , we decided to take them to hen house for breakfast . glad we did ! we ordered a kids chocolate chip pancake , it was the size of a medium pizzza . then came the regular pancake , size of an extra large pizza . they were both delicious . we were sate immediately , and service was very good .
american	we arrived at 11am ! the food was ready to go ! my husband ordered the meatloaf , mac and cheese and dressing ! he said the dressing was lacking in flavor ! but the meatloaf and mac cheese were great ! i ordered the fried chicken , mac and cheese and dirty rice ! the fried chicken is cooked to order so be prepared to wait ! worth the wait by the way ! the portions are huge but it was hot inside ! the customer service was good and very attentive !
american	on a browns game sunday we were promptly seated and our waiter sam immediately greeted us . he was friendly and helpful in our drink selection . the salad bar is bottomless and you won 't be choosing salad with choices like shrimp , crab legs , olives , and various cheeses ! when you are ready you flip over a card signaling the meat guys that you are ready for the onslaught . 13 different choices of excellently prepared meats . if you are into beef this allows you to enjoy the nuances of each cut back to back ! excellent service , perfect food priced right !
american	i don 't know if they still have it , but at the time it was under 25 bucks pp and included a basket of fresh pastries , fresh-squeezed juice , champagne , surf & turf eggs benedict with potatoes & fried green onions , and chocolate dipped strawberries & petit fours for dessert . what a fabulous experience ! service was impeccable ; the decor was very classy . i wish all meals were this good !
american	having made a lot of wolfgang 's recipes at home and having gone to several of his other restaurants i went in with certain expectations . i ordered the signature smoked salmon pizza with salmon roe and my girlfriend ordered a pasta with asparagus . both were fantastic . the salmon and and roe were generous . i liked the very contemporary decor . however , we were tucked away in a corner of the restaurant and service was below my expectations . we only saw our waiter for the ordering and serving , we couldn 't get any refills on our drinks , sort of disappointing . overall a must try in vegas if you can 't make it to the one in la .
american	ate lunch here and they had no problem switching out a meal when one of us changed out mind . the kilt-raiser beer was refreshing .
american	i decided to order a gyro meal to-go . the lady at the counter is super nice . after explaining to me the items on the menu , i went with what i know best , the gyro . i shared the meal with my bf and it actually was enough food . the gyro was tender and flavorful , the salad consisted of fresh ingredients , the fries were freshly fried . definitely a delicious meal . we will return to try other items on the menu ...
american	ordered : burger , brewhouse chicken and chocolate lava cake not busy @ 5 : 15pm , 5-6 tables had to wait awhile for someone to seat us waiter was nice but seemed distracted the whole time . forgot my lemon and then condiments for burger . food was hot and fresh good experience overall .
american	however , daily dose sets the bar . their breakfast is always hot , fresh , and delicious ! i recommend this spot to everyone ! ! yum !
american	not the case at all . i could still eat their pizza every day . best pizza around . recommend the gionino 's best with a side of white sauce for dipping .
american	the menu has a variety of items and the beer selection is one of the best in the area . my sister and i ordered a pan pizza ( always my favorite ) and my mother ordered the greek salad , which was great ! the brick house is just what this area needed . the service was okay . i only say " okay " because i myself am a server and tend to over-critique my server . she was attentive and nice , but didn 't engage like i do when i wait on a guest . i will certainly be returning !
american	you didn 't want to venture to the doors because of the bums that hung around outside begging for food or money . but today as i am sitting here i can honestly say wow they did an amazing job on the remodel . they even took away the outdoor section where the bums used to be . the manager is walking around asking how everyone is and that 's a great thing ! give this mcdonald 's another shot guys !
american	i chose mediterranean majik since that style of food is my favorite . i only wanted something small and settled on the fattoush salad . delicious ! ! really crunchy fresh , not soggy from the tasty dressing . the beets and i believe mushrooms , were definitely a nice added touch . i look forward to trying some of the other items on their menu soon . the owner was very personable and attentive .
american	although there was a forty minute wait when we arrived , there were multiple patio seats and tables outside of the restaurant that made waiting quite comfortable . we also made sure to order a few drinks at the bar to sip as we waited . in terms of the menu , there is a wide variety of options , but the fried chicken is a must ! the biscuit and gravy that came with the dish were extremely delicious and not too heavy .
american	coincidently , we also happened to each be wearing pink ( not planned ! ) so it seemed even more fitting . i ordered the hot dog with mushrooms and swiss . my friend ordered a chili dog , and another ordered the turkey dog . we also ordered a side of fries and rings to share . food came out quickly and i thought my dog was delicious . the fries were good but got cold quickly ... most likely because it was cold outside where we were sitting , but still . the onion rings were ginormous and tasty . lunch came out to a bit under $ 10 per person which i don 't think is bad . i would come back .
american	the service and food were perfect . the staff were very friendly and took care of me very well . i had the french toast with a side of potatoes . so good ! i will be sure to continue sending my guests to this fabulous breakfast spot .
american	he also asked when the food was purchased . this showed me the manager cares about the quality of their food and wants to ensure it doesn 't happen again . i have been back several times since and the quality was spectacular , their usual norm . don 't forget , you get a free meal on your birthday . i love joe 's farm grill .
american	i was very touched that he took the time to contact me .
american	he offered to send me a gift card and hoped that i would give the restaurant a second chance . this shows a high level of customer service and guest recovery ! thanks brad and i will definitely be returning to lucille 's in red rock !
american	i wish we would have long before . i ordered the quiche florentine and my husband had the chicken parmigiana . wow , were we both pleasantly surprised ! we were pleased with the speed of service ( we went at lunchtime ) , the food was fantastic , and the atmosphere is very cozy and clean . the prices seemed to be pretty typical . the portions were quite large . we will definitely go again .
american	i 'll be honest , these are not the best burgers i 've ever had - nor are they best sliders either . but hey , they 're tasty and they get the job done . they 're pricey but that 's common in vegas , but i must say the sliders with cheese are delicious . their chicken rings , yes " rings " are delicious as well . so if you find yourself nearby while walking the strip and need either a small snack or full meal , try it . it 's not the best burger in town , but it 's a tasty for what it is .
american	oakhurst is incredibly excited to have our own cm and can 't wait to see what new developments heads our way over the next couple years : )
american	the food is always amazing . some favorites are the cornbread , the dip appetizer , the main salad , prime rib sandwich , and the key lime pie . i no longer live in charlotte but anytime i 'm nearby i make it a point to stop and have dinner here . the only negative is they got rid of their main event couples dinner special . please please bring it back !
american	there 's always a line which i never really had time for but glad i did . the chicken was moist ( ugh , i hate that word too ) and succulent . crispy on the outside . the waffle , not so sweet but a good balance with the chicken and the bag of fries were really good as well . coleslaw wasn 't memorable but it 's a chicken and waffles place , what do you expect !
american	i am a huge fan of fraboni 's . in the year since my first experience the only thing i found that i am not in love with is the frozen pizza .
american	yay - great flavorful food , service with a smile , it 's all you really need in a breakfast restaurant . the skillets actually come in gorgeous skillets , making for a presentation likely to make your companion jealous . the huevos rancheros is my favorite - a wonderful mix of freshness , spicy and perfectly cooked eggs . you really can 't go wrong with the menu . check it out !
american	i 'm glad i came at 1030 because there 's usually a line . i can see why . it 's the best urn coffee i 've had in town . friendly , fast service . but be prepared to carb load . the waffles are artisinal , crispy on the outside and chewy in the inside . not the dry or soggy variety that often parade as an excuse . chicken tenders and waffles , with added pecans are an honest homage to the southern classic . do it . but if you are carb intolerant , there are still a bunch of good looking options that i saw go by . as a matter of fact , i could eat breakfast here every day .
american	the chicken wings and ribs were delicious and freshly grilled . the mac & cheese was good but the mash potatoes were salty , the corn is out of a can but i don 't care since i didn 't go for the corn . the cucumber salad is really good too . the place was very clean and has good customer service . all in all we will be back soon. loved the outdoor seating !
american	" the atmosphere is pretty frou-frou ( having 3 boys is probably why we 've never tried it before ) but we were seated pretty quickly and our server was nice & efficient . we all ordered burgers and all were surprisingly good , our fries , well , were just fries . presentation , flavor and portions were great . of course had to finish our meal off with their famous frozen hot chocolate which was everything serendipity . glad we gave it a try .
american	we had the chateaubriand and it was out of this world . the waitstaff was very attentive , but not part of the conversation . we can 't wait for our next trip out here to eat at andre 's again .
american	and how glad i am that i did . the complimentary popovers , of which they had quite a variety , were very tasty . i asked for two ... : - ) for my main , i ordered the shrimp blt . the sandwich was very good . it was not simply a " shrimp " sandwich . it 's better described as a jumbo prawn , super blt ! the dressing on the sandwich was very flavorful and the portion substantial . the bacon component of this blt was actually crispy prosciutto . overall , it was a good dish . the service was first class and the decor elegant . i recommend this restaurant for lunch or brunch .
american	solid offerings , nice vibe to the space , friendly service , reasonable prices . we don 't live in the area , but i 'd go back when we 're around . i am curious about their burgers ... next time .
american	jamms once again provided us with top notch service , very generous portion sizes . we joined them early in the morning for breakfast to which we were promptly seated and drink orders were taken immediately and brought out right away . other than my wife getting a bagel instead of an english muffin , which she didn 't mind getting , it was great ! my drink never dropped below half full . great staff and great food . waiters and waitresses in vegas could learn something from a small ma & pop place like this about customer service and attitude .
american	there is elk meat here ! that stuff tastes sooo unique , it kinda tastes like duck , but more flavorful and more distinct . its hard to explain go and try ! there are lots of alaska king crab legs here , and a butter dispenser . creme brulee , i ate 100 of these before i left with a candied apple . this place is food heaven . i wish it were my kitchen at home . i started lining up at 3pm ? and paid for lunch but it turned into dinner , sooooooo plan your time wisely ! eat all day !
american	i have been here several times since it opened and it has always satisfied . the beef brisket is flavorful and tender . all the house bbq sauces ( 3 ) are very unique from one another . the sides are tasty but the beans should be a larger portion ( hence my 4 star rating , otherwise it would receive top marks ) . the staff is friendly and service is excellent .
american	the wings are amazing , some of the best i 've ever had and have ruined wings for me because all i want is aft wings . the sauces are all delicious that they give you . ribs , fries , chicken , just everything is unreal . getting hungry typing this . apparently they have a really nice patio too .
american	and because someone in the kitchen knows how to cook mushrooms correctly ! great service .
american	nice upscale brew pub with much better than average food ! so it goes like this . grab a couple of fresh micro brews , i tend to prefer an ipa . order up an app , the fried dill pickles are amazing . have a great conversation while you get a fresh made salad with meat on the top . love that salmon . with all of that and good service you have a winner !
american	fresh and tasty . you can go only salad bar or have it with an order . 12 bucks and five bucks respectively . roomy , a bit chilly inside , you 'd better have a light jacket on in . i had the fish and chips . the fish was ok but the fries can improve . staff are nice and friendly . prices ok . parking no problem there 's a huge parking lot . it is child friendly too .
american	we were seated quickly and the server let us take our time to decide on relatively busy saturday night . we enjoyed some very tasty sashimi ( the ahi was a standout ) and a couple of their custom " kona rolls . " i 've always liked the dark and cool atmosphere . another very satisfying experience at this location where i have been spending the occasional datenight since . . . . geez . . . . clinton was still president . just realized . . . .
american	it 's a great place for lunch and very family friendly . you will leave here feeling like you just had a great meal with old friends , even if it is your first time here . 10 / 10 will be back : )
american	we were greeted at the door by the cashier and asked how many ? we got sat down right away . the food was served quick and the customer service was exceptional . large menu , and the deserts are very good ! we tried the banana creme pie and lets just say we will be going back for the desert alone ! great experience !
american	server is what i 'm sure is a first-generation greek immigrant grandma . cute ! wish they had wi-fi though . gyro was tasty . you can get a side salad instead of fries for $ 1 more . total of $ 8 for an authentic lunch .
american	couples of all ages and friends groups and families enjoyed their dinners with local live music playing lightly in the back area . ' cue menu is extensive- we started with beet salad : superior ! and their iceberg wedge which he loved . lucky us-we had josh who was charmingly conversational without being overly intrusive and very knowledgeable about menu selections . prime rib was rubbed with tasty smoky flavor-perfect at medium rare and take aways with its goat chews mashed potatoes . his full rack was meat falling off the rib tender and so tasty-also ample for takeaway . coleslaw was perfectly dressed . would definitely recommend for ' cue lovers of all ages .
american	the seafood items are fantastic , and we loved the s 'mores pie and doughnuts ! great location too !
american	decent prices , great comfort food and straight forward service .
american	i had the shrimp and grits and they were on point . the bread isn 't as great as everyone claims , but it could be that it arrived between lukewarm and cold . the jambalaya was also tasty !
american	the service was friendly and helpful . the seasoning they use on their shrimp and crab was really good . and their catfish was very tasty too . cooked very nicely . overall , definitely a good place to chow down on some well-prepared seafood .
american	i love the beer battered fries and all the sandwiches / burgers . i really liked the beer sampler , it 's a great way to try different beers , but i always stick with the peach ale . it 's so light with just a hint of peach . very refreshing and addicting ! it gets super crowded , and parking is impossible , but it 's all for a reason . this place is very laid back , fun , friendly workers , great food , great drinks .. they 're definitely doing something right ! !
american	this is located in a shopping plaza across from the mustard seed . when i first walked in i looked at the menu and what caught my attention was the choice of burger options . you can build your own burger or select from one of their standards . being this was my first time here i selected an all american with the usual toppings , side of fries and pop . this was a good burger . the ratio of bread , toppings and meat were good . next time i will try a double . the fries were hot and tasty . i will come back here again . try it out for the adventure of a fun burger joint . i love options .
american	the restaurant was not very crowded and that helped with the noise levels . always a good meal and great service has been my experience at mallorca .
american	instead , they serve interesting , tasty food in a welcoming atmosphere that just happens to highlight the various food philosophies they service -- thankfully , without losing sight of the actual food .
american	it 's a bit cramped though with a bar in the middle and slightly louder music . wife and i split the charcuterie and corndog as appetizers . i was surprised by the amount of meat you get ! kobe corndog was also good with the wasabi mayo . for entree we split the lamb burger which was my first time having lamb as a burger . it was good juicy and had a really good sauce . overall it was a good place and i can see it being fun to go for drinks and hanging out with friends . reason for not five stars was although it was good , it didn 't completely wow me .
american	burgers , mac and cheese , and desserts delicious . great service and fun atmosphere . also have late night drink specials !
american	looks yummo ... oh dear lord in heaven , absolutely out-of-this-world amazing ! definitely gives , boston , chicago , and new york a run for their money . the hubs had the pepperoni dog and the cheesy beef slider and was blown away with the layering of flavors . yes , it 's tucked away at the end of the chevron building but most definitely worth the hunt . gps is your friend and friends encourage friends to eat great food . stop in , pass it on , bring others . you won 't be disappointed .
american	the waffles are amazing ( and we eat real waffles at home all the time ) , the chicken was just as you would expect ... wonderful . a real treat !
american	the onion rings have a nice crispy breading . will definitely be back .
american	have been here twice and never disappointed . made from scratch food , friendly service and great prices .
american	busy weekend brunch makes for a vibrant environment . the beers are good and yes it is ok to have one for breakfast . the grovey goes well the the french toast .
american	the chicken and waffles were delicious . the drinks were just as good . staff is super friendly .
american	best thing on the menu ? beer battered french fries , hands down . good homemade ranch dressing . great views of the mcdowell mountains from the patio . i dig the live music on thurs - sat . the kitchen gets quite backed up on weekend nights - expect to wait a looooong time for your food . great happy hour & other drink specials . steer clear of the mashed potatoes - kind of gluey . the wings are pretty good . the food is decent - the ambiance / location is better .
american	nice southern style traditional food . do not go here if you are watching your calories . finding a healthy option is nearly impossible .
american	we love the outdoor patio with ping pong and corn hole . the kids can play while they wait for food and after they eat while i relax and drink my coffee .
american	i 've sat at the bar and sat downstairs to eat , both are enjoyable . the bartender was funny and full of great stories -der that 's a prerequisite isn 't it ? downstairs was elegant yet fun as well . if you 're going to complain about spending money for food go to mcd 's for a fish fillet -it 's dining ! not eating . wine list was good , obviously seafood and italian limits your options but overeating was prepared to perfection . have to recommend the calamari , i usually stay away from recommending dishes but it was outstanding . romantic-si , a large group -si , it 's at wynn so you cannot go wrong .
american	great food and waiter , craig , was a delight . music from the 60s and 70s playing . i 'd definitely would come back .
american	be sure to order something flaming cause that 's a real treat . the food is great , i love the gyro platter , and the gyro salad . the portions are surprising , since if you get a large salad you would be amazed and their idea of " large . " the deserts are okay , but i haven 't had many of them since by the time it comes around i am ready to be rolled out the door .
american	food is great ! ! especially the burgers . haven 't had a chance to try the pizza. but i hear it is amazing ! ! ! . next time . they have a $ 20 match play and food coupons in valpak ( the blue envelope )
american	the food is generally very good though not consistently so . the portion sizes are huge so we end up taking something home with us every time . their prices are reasonable , especially for the amount of food you get . love so many of their beers . i just wish the beer was colder all the time . maybe i 'm an amateur beer drinker , but i like it really cold . sometimes it 's almost room temperature here which doesn 't stop me from drinking it , of course !
american	also there are tv 's everywhere so if you are looking for a game to watch , chances are they have it playing . be sure to visit on wednesday 's at it is half price games !
american	fun atmosphere for the biker in you . friendly people and staff . defiantly go again . and the custom bike company touches are cool .
american	get the soda sampler and some extra cups to share tastings . they take your picture with the coke polar bear downstairs . its not free but still enjoyable .
american	we went there after the program interview . i order some salmon and a lager . i like the ambience , although i wish i was sitting next to more of the prettier girls from our interview group and less with the guys that were interviewing . overall , the food selection was great and so was the brews
american	this is a great family place . i would recommend it for any out of town guests you may have visiting you . it works for adults and for kids . there is outdoor seating . oh yeah you want to know about the food . i usually get the pulled pork or salad . yup salad , it 's great with turkey ! my husband always gets the brisket and loves it . you will see a lot of people with the loaded baked potato . for a good reason , it is delicious . again i get the turkey on it . when i do get the potato , i also get a to go box . it is really big !
american	i wasn 't as impressed as i was hoping i was going to be , but for the price and being that it 's a hot dog , it 's definitely right . i don 't really know how you can make a hot dog " gourmet " but i am assuming this is as close as it can get . i definitely don 't get the hype as much as other people play it up , but i 'll be back !
american	great food selections 24 hrs a day . the service is amazing in both the bar and dining room . if there 's a game on you want to watch , it 's probably on one of their many tvs . breakfast lunch and dinner ...
american	love my salmon dinner , and the desserts were pretty yum . watch over your kids though , because this restaurant isn 't really " gated " and therefore little kids can sneak through the side curtains ! had to chase my brothers a couple of times . also great for a non-touristy restaurant atmosphere ! 86 those tourists ...
american	went with our two older kids and they loved the people watching . the food is good but simple . the wine iv is a full bottle so be ready . the spanking is no joke . if you don 't finish your food your waitress will spank you and it 's not a light spank . some of the waitresses really knew how to hit and i 'm sure their guest went home with a bruise . even the tough guys would tear up . it 's a cash only place and perfect for those wanting to have fun !
american	a fun resturant with some unusual offerings for breakfast lunch and dinner , my wife and i had a great brunch , service was very good .
american	seafood is fresh and well prepared . one of the best fish sandwiches in pittsburgh and the lobster roll is to die for . fun busy atmosphere with friendly staff . they must stop if you 're in pittsburgh .
american	of course there are a ton of tvs and it 's a fun place to catch a game , but sconniebar goes beyond that . with super friendly service and delicious homemade mac and cheese , sconniebar lives up to its goal of celebrating the best parts of wisconsin . it exceeded my expectations and will definitely be a go-to place for me whenever i 'm in town .
american	service dance to be friendly and upbeat . pros : decor energetic mood nice varieties of dining areas high quality ingredients unusual ingredients that can be tasty you can get healthy food that will satisfy almost anyone cons : menu context not necessarily as healthy as they seem to advertise can get really busy
american	we enjoyed the design of the restaurant , the line dancing waitresses and the huge portions of food . my husband and i split an appetizer and an entree and had left overs for the next day . the filet steak was tender and cooked perfectly . i 'd recommend it . don 't risk having the sirloin , which is generally tougher and not marbled . if you 're into it , the loaded sweet potato or loaded baked potato are delicious ! our server was attentive and friendly . despite it being crowded , we were served quickly and refilled on rolls and drinks twice . it 's always busy so they must be doing something right !
american	it usually is pretty busy , which is encouraging . it definitely will be in my monthly breakfast rotation !
american	love the country feel and incredible customer service . workers are always friendly .
american	i absolutely enjoyed their lobster crab bisque and their price fix menu is good ! there is better steak out there but i like coming here for a $ 45 3 course steak dinner . what i didn 't like is the staff . they 're quite rude when i called in for a reservation . their tone sounded like they didn 't care to accommodate .
american	excellent food and service . always on point . great atmosphere and ambiance . can 't wait to return . had the garlic mash potatoes , 22 oz. bone in rib eye , and seared brussel sprouts . incredible ! !
american	our server joe was amazing even though we asked alot of questions . great service and atmosphere even at 3 am ...
american	they truly go above and beyond to make each visit better than the last . thank you david etz
american	brian was great . the service was on time without having the feeling of being rushed . the food was great .
american	truth is , the ingredients are pretty bare minimum - iceberg lettuce , cucumber , tomatoes , olives and feta cheese . what really makes this salad worth the trek to bathurst and wilson is the creamy salad dressing . the waiters have learned - just give the table their own bottle of salad dressing so you don 't have to keep returning to the kitchen for more . if you 're in the mood for greek salad for dinner , add a chicken skewer for some extra protein . it 's open late so a good " after baseball " spot .
american	food was wonderful ! wendy was our waitress and was amazing ! very informative with our order ! what an accent to your company thank you all
american	$ 4 conway on a saturday evening . love the basement level , the dark lighting is exceptional and creates a laid back atmosphere . the televisions had the cavs game on where kyrie hits another gamewinner as the cheers filled the room . bartenders serve quickly and the beer is exceptional and not outrageously priced . definitely coming back to try some food . just get there early if you don 't want to stand .
american	the chicken is great , the fries are crinkle cut and i love the bread on top ! but the best part is the " sauce " ! the restaurant is clean , the food is good and i love the sauce !
american	we 're a family of four and it seems we can agree on this place more than most . my son and i like the catfish or smoked wings while the girls like the pork . the sides all always interesting . the beer selection is top notch with something for most beer drinkers . it can get noisy at times especially when young kids are in large quantity . i 'm always impressed with the consistent quality and would recommend this place to anyone visiting matthews .
american	mia was behind the bar again and our server vic was attentive but not overbearing . if you truly want to have a taste of nola ..... get down to butler street .
american	again , awesome sandwiches , awesome service , clean , and all staff are friendly and attentive , troy and eric are just so nice and do an excellent job ! ! !
american	no wait at all ( got lucky ) . smoked salmon scramble ( ended up ordering another one since the boys liked my dish ) . daughter enjoyed the biscuit chicken pot pie . can 't remember what the others ordered . all i know is that we all enjoyed it . mom did enjoy the grits . : - ) will return if in the area !
american	again can 't eave enough about how great this place is .... great customer service on a busy saturday night the owner stopped by to make sure we had everything we needed .... food spectacular i will be spreading the word ... great bbq has arrived in clt .......
american	wife and i had such a great time here first time in january , we had to come back . i had the britannia burger , medium . it was good ! i felt the arugula was a little too peppery for this burger and overpowered the cheddar . i think the mango chutney ended up on only half of the burger . a thicker cut of cheese on this one would definitely bring it up to great burger standards . wife and i were smarter this time and only shared one order of fries ! !
american	enjoyed the smoked salmon rosti / scrambled egg dish which they have changed a little -- still good , but i prefer the old way of cooking the potatoes . the bread choice is still wonderful , even love the butter balls and jam . they also make a great bloody mary ( and i am very critical of a bloody ) . chic ambience outdoors , though they could use some more umbrellas on the patio on a 90 degree day . ( it would be nice to have those wonderful outdoor air conditioners , but i realize this is toronto ) . very nice brunch , the only mar being the loud , obnoxious and very nouveau family closely seated at the next table .
american	i always have the best time with my family . i love this place . katrina and jennifer always have a smiles on their face and make us feel welcome . i will be back again soon with my family . thanks for always making us feel like home .
american	but i might add today in the parking lot i witnessed how ppl have become so " entitled " in our society and it was an eye opening experience to actually see how my waitresses sam josh brenna elizabeth kelly ryan and all the others must feel with this society so bug hugggs to alll of you in dealing with these select individuals i give hugsss to there dedication for allowing customers to treat them in properly and than post bad reviews about there " service " on yelp which clearly is not always the case some ppl just will nvr be " happy " its insanity hairdoc tk .
american	since i cannot eat a burger at every joint on the strip , i had a salad , but burgers do look great ! !
american	i have never been let down here . always amazing food and excellent service , which is astonishing being that i live next door and have been here frequently . i have always loved houston 's best for lunch . also , check out their sister establishment " bandera " in old town .
american	don 't forget a piece of that scrumptious baklava ! ! best value in town when it comes to greek .
american	great food . fast delivery . fantastic wings . good onion rings and out standing hoagies . thanks .
american	greeted upon entry with a smiles from several employees . lean brisket , bread , macaroni and cheese and cherry cobbler was fantastic tonight . changes to the baked beans ... please have a no bacon option . the brisket baked beans were the reason to visit previously but now they have bacon . i see many positive improvements at this business and appreciate good quality fresh foods .
american	no problems at all , waitress even split up the check . i had a cheeseburger and it was delicious ! ! ! my wife had steak with the roquefort butter and it was also amazing . the creamed cauliflower was very good as well . our table was inside because of the large party . i will eat here again for sure , very good and i 'd like to sit on the patio .
american	lobster bisque and lobster grilled cheese sandwich are amazeballs . it 's so good that i would book a room at planet hollywood again just so i can roll out of bed the next morning and shovel food into my mouth . one minor gripe though : they were slow on giving me and my roommate our morning tea . but who needs tea when you have alcohol in vegas ?
american	we had the waitresses ( there was only one for a long time ) both were great , hope to be back real soon !
american	the service at the bar is great . tonight i enjoyed the lettuce wraps - fresh , zippy , good . next i had a portion of the pea soup - this soup would have been superior had it not been excessively salty . last on my list : lamb belly . the small roulades look a little skimpy at first but , oh my goodness , they are so rich , i could not have eaten any more ! it was a perfect portion of such a wonderfully flavored dish - very good , highly recommended .
american	there was live music and a ton of upbeat employees . we sat on the patio and it was perfect night for it , our waitress was so nice ! we kept commenting on it during the night . i come from the customer service industry so when i go out i expect at least a smile and approachable attitude , this girl was all that and more ! i didn 't get her name but she had super straight teeth and tattoos ? lol i tried !
american	i recommend the chix broadway sandwich . the naked chix were great as well and ( see photo ) the skinny bowl with acai sorbet , granola , bananas , strawberries , almonds , and agave nectar is ridiculously delicious . as is their hot mame ( see photo ) which is chili garlic edamame . great find ! ! ! ! please expand to la , haha
american	the feel the taste and the overall relaxed atmosphere it should be a point of destination for a burger and a beer ! ! ! give a try tell them i sent you !
american	the bar staff there was amazing , like more amazing than the regular wait staff there . i am always amazed that they have to memorize the menu , the whole menu and get special long training to be able to work there . i am not sure the bartender 's name but he has long hair and is very friendly and definitely a great waiter / bartender , you just don 't find many these days . the food is always good , no matter what cheesecake factory i have ever been to , but i just wanted to comment on the bar staff and their extraordinary friendly and knowledgeable service they offer .
american	i 'm beginning to think yelp ratings are useless for chains like this , because we were almost scared away by the 2.5 . but a mcdonalds is a mcdonalds , how bad could it be ? well , we were very pleasantly surprised . everyone was super friendly ( like legitimately nice people friendly ) , and our order was correct and really good . sometimes you get a dry burger , or old fries ... everything was hot , fresh , and delicious . it really hit the spot , and we at least learned the lesson that there 's no point looking at yelp reviews for mcdonalds . ironic that i 'm now writing one : p
american	i love the staff , the service , and of course the food . calamari , lobster , crab , and yes , fries . all great . and the service is always just about enough . there are places where you 'd rather they stop coming but here , they know when you need them . so , i gave 'hem a great review last time on their exchange room and filet mignon . now , i must recommend that you eat out in the sun as well . yes , they have tables in the shade as well .
american	our waiter , jaqwan , was amazing .... aahhhhhhhhh ....
american	it is soooo thick and fluffy ! so , so good . any sandwich on this bread is amazing : best chicken schwarma best gyro best flat bread i have ever had love this place !
american	everyone ordered sliders , including the p90x fanatic . he was willing to break his diet to finally try the slider truck . i had : pulled porkie , barbie and caprese . this was my first time trying the caprese , and i have to say , i didn 't love it , but maybe that 's because eggplant can only be so good in comparison to delicious meat ! believe the hype . ric and the guys rock ! nothing makes your day better like a good fist bump . if you haven 't been to the slider truck yet , get on the bandwagon and go . just leave a pulled porkie for me !
american	i ate here three times while staying at the weston and the place was busy and i couldn 't have asked for a better experience . staff , very helpful and polite . food was really good overall . every restaurant has its bad days and such . in two of the three cases the manager was running about helping his staff , greeting guests and making sure it was all good . perhaps a while back they had a bad run but fixed things ? ! i think you are safe to give this a try . breakfast is great ! for lunch / dinner ... finally ... someone that knows how to make a ruben ! ! !
american	we were driving east from toronto and found this quaint town and enjoyable place . outside dining has umbrellas on most tables , but not all ( not a problem for us but it appeared to be for others ) . ordered the special burger of the day and it was fantastic ! a great stop !
american	everything on the menu is a solid choice . everybody knows about the burgers and breakfast but they also do great liver , souvlaki , sandwiches , etc . they released a new menu too with all kinds of interesting stuff . all the staff members are always fantastic . great " family " feel . yes it is a small joint so you might not get a table at peak hours but i 've never had a problem . i think the mafioso feel of the strip mall keeps the crowds at bay . on par with t-bone 's for " colorful " clientele . wish they were open later .
american	if you come to this locale please ask for this server he 's great and his service is on par .
american	join the email club for 50 % off or a bogo coupon in your email box every week . we love the salad bar here . it is always so fresh and yummy . salad bar comes with most but not all entrees . we like the mini burger combo that comes with the salad bar for like $ 8.99 . they change the menu here a lot but we always find something new and great tasting on the menu . lots of steaks , ribs , shrimp and the burgers are great . enjoy !
american	my mom and i eat regularly . he greeted us with diet cokes and water without taking our order and brought us bread right after that . talk about customer service and excellence ! we then ordered and he remembered our usual orders . not only is the food delicious but the experience here is out of this world , we always feel like queens coming to this location . thank you serge ! !
american	sarah 's eyes roll deep in her head when we talk of the dinner here . i enjoyed it immensely ... but i love that she loved it more . there 's nothing better than making my girl happy , and n9ne did it exceedingly well .
american	it was the pizookie that brought me back , but i 'm glad it did , because it was a completely different experience this time . i had the beachhouse blonde beer battered fish and chips this time. it was delicious . the fish was perfectly fried , light , and not greasy at all . the fries were crisp and hot . and our waitress , taylor , was friendly , knowledgable , and attentive . for dessert , i went with the salted caramel pizookie . it was yummy . some of the caramel got crispy and that gave it a nice little crunch . i 'm glad this trip was better than my first . i 'll be back again .
american	the weather held so we sat on the patio overlooking the lake ( behind the chorus bldg ) . restaurant has only been open 3 weeks , the service was therefore a bit sloppy . but everyone was friendly ! menu is not large , but it had some decent things on it , even salmon curry ! i had pulled pork tacos and a large mixed green salad with heirloom tomatoes and beets . the salad lacked a dressing and could be taken as bland , but i enjoyed it nonetheless ( less calories ! ) . they also have comfy sofa seating with fire pits - fun ! it was really nice walking along the waterfront and seeing the city lights . : )
american	we always eat here best bbq in charlotte . kids always get there fill . everyone is friendly feels homey .
american	the waffles are warm and fluffy , the chicken is crispy , and the banana pudding ( which i tried for the first time tonight ) was hands down the best dessert i 've ever had . i 'm already thinking about my next visit .
american	again .... the freaking pizza cookie. how can you not just fade away into bliss when eating this thing .... it it it it is ridiculous !
american	you can get a full lunch for $ 3.25- like the fresh pretzel with parm as well as the plain- not a fan of the cookie and other baked good but other seem to buy them .
american	rebecca , you made the night worth writing about . yes , you are the manager , but you managed to go above and beyond your duty . jimbo was correct in his assessment of you and your staff . kathy was the perfect mixologist , and i promise i won 't ask for a hug prematurely ! ! next time , lol . i shall return .
american	steak perfect ... prawns amazing . .. and our server .. cooper ... is most amazing ! thank you for a special day ! : )
american	my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and lori helped us . she was lovely . went above and beyond to help us , as she was crushed with a busy bar . we split the short rib burger and they brought it on two separate plates already halved . it is the little touches like this that make us regular customers . great work tavern 1947 .
american	i love coming here because my monkeys and i feel like family . i brought a fellow yelper ( yay mackalicious ! ) to see what i was bragging about and he felt the exact same way . we love you steve and crew . will be back soon for more breakfast goodness .
american	food was ok . i had the ribeye ( med rare ) and loaded mash potatoes . service was great ( danny was server ) . he was great . checked on all his tables . suggested non menu items . cleaned tabled--mean really cleaned--like he was getting ready for surgery--went not checking tables . looked like he was running bar items when he could . great guy .
american	he greeted us immediately and got us something to drink and our dog a water bowl . i opted for the # 1 sand which , it was so big i could only eat half . and i got a small cup of the soup of the day : chicken tortilla ; it was sooo good . perfect to help cure a st paddys night . my boyfriend got the scramble which he enjoyed . service here is the best and the prices and quality of food is top notch .
american	steaks are amazing but the sea bass is my wifes go-to dinner there .
american	in addition to a bakery and grill , you can also find cute niknaks and stationary . if there was ever a north scottsdale gas station , this is it !
american	there is something for everyone in vegas . i 've never had a better breakfasts sandwich . the line was long but well worth the wait , i promise . this restaurant is located in the cosmopolitan hotel . lower left photo , fairfax sandwich : scrambled eggs , chives , caramelized onions , cheddar cheese , sriracha mayo , in a warm brioche bun and gaucho sandwich : seared wagyu tri-tip steak , over medium egg , chimichurri sauce , red onions , dresses arugula in a warm brioche bun separated by the " bomb ass biscuit " per the cashier suggestion .
american	usually go for a duck fat fries , extra dirty ! skip the bread and do their curry wurst if you want to change it up . great craft beers on tap with lines that are cleaned regularly ! got some good barley wines and local bottles available too . call ahead though for seats - place gets cray .
american	mac n cheese , short rib meatballs and adult tater tots .... so delicious ! scott here at stacks took great care of us .... thank you scott would of took a pic but it was gone before i could lol
american	not the cheapest price for quantity but the quality of the za makes up for it . beer selection is a little weak ... but hey it 's a small pizza joint and the za is the feature item ! true pizza lovers will enjoy this place .
american	fresh and tasty food , friendly staff , short lines . turkey , smoked gouda , roasted red pepper flat bread warmed on a panini grill . beth ann the barista was friendly and helped me pick my sandwich . one star off for cost .
american	great atmosphere and fantastic food offerings . i have yet to have a meal that disappoints . it is also the only restaurant that offers fresh juices in the uptown district . an added bonus is a changing beer list . they carry a variety of seasonal micros .
american	this is a very friendly place with excellent food and service . the food is so well prepared with a varied menu . the second your arrive , staff welcomes you like family . make a reservation because people are finding out about this place !
american	we stopped here for lunch . the chicken salad sandwich was delicious and so was the grilled cheese my boyfriend ordered . there menu is a mix of salads , sandwiches , and polish entres . we will be back and try this place for dinner .
american	great atmosphere to go with great selection of wines . love that they have small plates , so you can dine on a variety of dishes . if the weather permits the outdoor seating is a must . there is a fireplace both indoors and outdoors . great atmosphere and friendly staff .
american	love the clean homey setting providing healthy yet exceptional choices for brunch . service with a smile too . lourdes
american	high quality ingredients , prepared to perfection resulting in great flavors . service was flawless . great value . outstanding lebanese food . tell everyone .
american	i had the best time here last weekend when we went up to montreal for a weekend getaway . we only tried three of their dishes since we weren 't that hungry but boy oh boy , their waiters / waitresses , the crowd , decor / mood of the restaurant and music was amazing . my friends and i met vito and he was very attentive and made sure we were good with what we needed . he was nice enough to recommend a few places to check out since he knew we weren 't from there . the hospitality was awesome and i would definitely come back the next time i visit montreal . that 's a promise !
american	i 've been there twice now and everyone had excellent food at every course . the first time i went i wasn 't sure if i was going to play cards at the senior center or go to dinner . once in the small but pleasant space , we had good service and delicious food . as long as the food continues to be well above average and surprisingly delicious , i 'll be going back . it 's strip food with local prices .
american	we did a combo plate at our last visit . was superfood . favorite was the smoked sausage with the mustard bbq sauce . pulled pork was spot on . for sides the creamed spinach is great - topped with crunchy spicy topping . server was good and ambiance is good too . this was our third time in and have not been disappointed yet . i 'd call it a classed up mac 's with better bbq .
american	beautiful decor ... dog friendly .. bike rack and outdoor seating . most importantely they roast their own cofee . i had the capuccino .
american	coffee is good , the peameal blt is excellent and the chocolate cake is very moist ( with an ice-cream on side ) ! it is the diner i am looking for in downtown . good price and good food ! i will definitely return .
american	the only place i want to go for breakfast on a sunday morning , along with every other resident in the town ! good food with a quality staff .
american	such a wonderfully unique experience , i enjoy myself every time i am there . whether its brunch , dinner or late night drinks and appetizers , the atmosphere is always bubbly and the food is always good . i have my favorites among the current restaurants , but each one is so unique , there is something here for everyone . i took my parents here from out of town and they were really impressed . the next weekend , i did some serious day drinking and brunch with my bff and had a ball . great place all around .
american	fresh ingredients , friendly service and a great value . finally an establishment in this specific store location that adds color to the area and a simple beer / wine pizza option before a movie . this one could last .
american	food , service , ambiance are great . the beer cheese croquettes are delicious and the mac 'n'cheese is an accomplished and gratifying rendition to this childhood comfort food . delicious desserts and great drinks are the culmination to a great night at the gabardine . highly recommend . looking forward to returning soon .
american	great atmosphere and and live music . the coffee is always fresh and the food is tasty .
american	it 's been there quietly serving solid customers for years . if you go in once you 'll become a regular . i can 't say enough about the people or the food . so much more than an awesome local butcher . they also make it hot and ready ... like a glorious food truck that parks in the same place forever . the sandwiches , chicken , fish , salads , fries , and fine meats and seafoods . you just have to try it . you will never want to go anywhere else .
american	it had been a couple of years since i had been there . complimentary valet parking is available , otherwise there is ample street parking . we were seated in the patio on a beautiful summer night . our server was fabulous and her recommendations were spot on . i ordered the tandoori ribeye - medium-rare was just awesome and i loved it . it was an intriguing combo of tandoor cooking and a steak , a genius idea as far as i am concerned . i would go back again just for the rib eye . other entree i tried was peruvian chicken thighs - was pretty darn good . a + experience . a must go if you are in cleveland .
american	german style food . i had the breakfast casserole with cheese , poached eggs and holandise sauce . when the eggs broke in to baked casserole ....... omg . heaven ! ! all my friends that went there also really enjoyed the food . every kept complementing how much flavour was in each plate .
american	the batter / fry is wonderfully crisp and not too heavy . we tried the haddock and generic ' white fish ' . i would definitely pay the extra $ 1 and go with the haddock . we will definitely be back . a good creamy coleslaw . the fries seemed to be fresh cut but more importantly didn 't pick up any fishiness so either very clean oil or seperate fryer . service is prompt and friendly . interior is clean and well kept .
american	they call themselves a " locavore bistro " and all of their food is locally sourced . the service is friendly and the food excellent . i love the " eggs murgatroid " a delightful twist on " eggs benedict . " my favorite is their canoe potatoes . it is a place where the owner comes out of the kitchen at the end of your meal and asks you how you enjoyed the food and invites you to stay as long as you want .
american	a very small well run restaurant in the heart of glendale . the menu is very small , but not limited . everything that came out of the kitchen was full of flavor and also visually appealing . i ordered the shrimp po boy and it was done just right . i could actually taste the fried shrimp which is something most places don 't get right , even after multiple attempts . - parking was easy - extremely affordable - good service - not commercial : - )
american	my meal was delicious , starting with their " french toast " appetizer , a melange of tasty mushrooms juxtaposed with a buerre blanc . my husband 's veal short rib was delicious and tender , well partnered with a mushroom risotto , and my root vegetable cassoulet was excellent . finally , we paired a tokaji dessert wine with an unusual , but well-designed raspberry chocolate napoleon , bringing out the delicious chocolate notes in the tokaji . the service was excellent , the restaurant well hidden ( my favorite kind ) and the meal leisurely .
american	took friends there to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary and it was just perfect . great food and service . staff couldn 't have been more gracious and nicely acknowledged the special occasion . we will be back !
american	we 're not from the area and we searched out a family owned breakfast diner and found the perfect spot for breakfast and more ! perhaps the low ratings come from locals that want to keep this jewel a secret . great food , good price and top end service . glad we found mom 's !
american	i 've now been here several times since moving to pittsburgh , and it very quickly became one of my favorite places for brunch . the scallion and goat cheese frittata is a must try ; the fennel sausage adds a bit of bite to the otherwise rich dish . the seasonal specials , like the fresh berry and cream crepe , also highlights the cafe 's utility of fresh , local ingredients . be prepared to wait on the weekend , but also know that it 's worth it !
american	i have to admit i love the wigwam . the wigan is a historical hotel that has modernized but has been able to retain the historical past beautifully . the wigwam has magnificent restaurant , beautiful golf courses , day spa , places to walk , pools , bocce courts , and volleyball . when you stay at the wigwam you never have to leave the resort because the wigwam has it all .
american	stopped after a day at hoover dam and wasn 't disappointed by the recommendation of other yelpers . ordered the everything sandwich and it was delicious ! service was friendly and quick . the decor was quirky and fun .
american	absolutely delicious , with great service and a great & varied menu ! ! this is my new place when i 'm in the area !
american	incredible service that isn 't overly solicitous , romantic courtyard decorated so beautifully , and gorgeous , delicious food with a wonderful wine list . a must-do for any romantic night out . we will absolutely be back . this place was fabulous .
american	the coffee cups are mismatched . the owner is three feet away from me cooking . the sausage is made for them locally . and the food is frickin awesome . i had the pancakes , my daughter had the sausage and egg sandwich . cash only . friendly service .
american	this is one of the strangest restaurants of all time . i felt like i was hanging out on the set of trailer park boys ( they commit to the theme hardcore ) , yet they offer an impressive array of vegan and gluten free options . it 's quite the juxtaposition . they have gluten free bread and buns , and they even have a gluten free / vegan dessert that was killer . they call it a goo ball , and it consists of honey , oats , crisp rice , flax seed , and peanut butter . this place was so unique and satisfying ... i just couldn 't resist leaving a review .
american	we 've eaten here a few times and have loved our meals each time . the grilled sea bream is awesome and reasonably priced . we love the hummus ... they brought a plate of vegetables as well since i can 't eat bread . they all have an english menu .
american	well he said the swordfish with roasted potatoes , cabage and bacon was his fav so i went with that and let me tell you , i am ever so glad i did.i was in food heaven. and the cheese cake was to die for i dont remember the correct name but it had apples and cranberries . as for my husbands meal i could tell you much except he cleaned his plate ... thanks for a great dining expierience ... we will be going to eat there again and again and ...............
american	our pizza was delivered before our second mouthful of salad . it to was fresh with generous toppings but a bit dry with to little sauce for my taste . when near to arboretum give it a try !
american	the food is a cross between indian and middle eastern and excellent . we went there with three couples , and all had different dishes . they were delicious . because everything is made fresh and from scratch , they were able to accommodate any special food issues we had , with a smile . the owner was friendly and helpful .
american	wings special today and i tried the bbq and lemon pepper , both are pretty good . waffle fries are crispy , just awesome . owner jake is super nice and gives honest opinions . definitely one of the local gems
american	i ordered a spinach , mozz , and mushroom bagel sandwich and coffee. it was pretty good i must say. the coffee was good as well. as anyone knows , tons of bagel options .
american	you feel like you 've left town when you come here for a family picnic in the fall , winter , or spring . the leaves on the trees make it feel like you e gone somewhere else . the food is so good . salads are great . deserts are ridiculously amazing .
american	attention to detail and goes above and beyond . done the sterling brunch many years ago ... it 's changed quite a bit bit still has exceptional service and great food . lobster tails , prime rib , caviar , champaign and many other sides to tempt your stomach . although not as cheap as some of the other breakfast buffets , the sunday bruch event is well worth every penny .
american	so great . i walked in and loved the atmosphere . such an old school café ! all the workers were very friendly , lowkey babes and their macarons were gosh darn unbelievable . yes . yes to everything yes . if you haven 't been to public market , the time is now . i am a better person after this visit .
american	the prices were excellent . the portions were generous . the food was delicious . i had catfish . my husband had the sirloin steak . we both left full and happy . the server was amazing . the manager stopped by our table to see how we were doing . the one thing that might keep us from returning is that it is very , very loud , particularly when there is a birthday . otherwise , this roadhouse is a keeper .
american	i ordered the 7 oz texas brisket with garlic mashed potatoes and corn on the cob with a caesar salad to start . troy ordered the two meat combo with brisket ends and baby back ribs with honey peanut cole slaw and greens . the presentation was beautiful . the brisket and the ribs were perfect . the garlic mashed potatoes were nothing to write home about . the greens were too salty and the cole slaw while pretty was blah . if we were in the area we 'd might stop by again but wouldn 't drive the 20 miles out of our way .
american	first time trying crepes and they were delicious . montreal is the first city i 've been to with legitimate yelp reviews , just got to filter out the temper tantrum reviews complaining about waiting for a table when it 's busy and such .
american	super cute atmosphere ! i had fresh squeezed orange juice and pancakes the size of my face . they were perfect , creamy , not too sweet ... i should not have eaten all that food at once but it was sooo yummy ! : d
american	the restaurant itself was crowded and we opted to sit at the bar . it is a limited menu in the bar , appetizers and desserts only . we ordered the chicken wrap and corn dogs along with two signature drinks . our server was helpful and attentive and the price was right . i will definitely be back , i 'm curious to try it for dinner or lunch .
american	i had the peach ale sangria since i 'm not a beer drinker . she had a pint of the peach ale . we thought our drinks were refreshing since it was a 108 degree day ! we each ordered the bratwurst off the saturday early bird menu . they came with a pretzel bun and beer mustard . yummy ! i 'll go again now that i know there are other drinks other than beer ! !
american	the staff was very friendly the second i walked in the door and i was greeted by a number of their staff . i had never been before so the employees were helpful and made recommendations based on their personal favorite sandwiches as well as popular orders from other customers . i selected the # 20 without tomatoes and the citrus kale salad as my side . both were excellent ! overall it was a great experience , great food , pleasant staff , very reasonably priced and awesome outdoor patio . i will definitely be back !
american	we ate their right before the main menu kicked back in and the chef made us the lake erie perch dinner before it was officially available -- lightly breaded , delicious , generous portions . the red pepper bisque was good too . well worth the money !
american	it gets loud in there people , so be aware if your friend / date has any kind of hearing loss - it is really hard to hear when the place is packed , and it is almost always packed . i 've been multiple times and each time there is something new and delicious to discover . no reservations so best to get there early . and definitely get the mushrooms if they are on the menu .
american	i had the opportunity of dining here not once but twice in a week . both times the restaurant was exceptionally busy but our servers did a fantastic job . for those of you contemplating going - don 't just go and request seating next to wynn 's lake of dreams in the evening . i had the opportunity to try the following : marinated beet salad big eyed tuna ceviche filet medium ( both times ) maine lobster mac n cheese au gratin potatoes grilled asparagus with lemon butter after typing all that now i 'm hungry . all were excellent . remember you only have this one life to live so you might as well enjoy it .
american	cocktails are pretty good also ! ! however , portion sizes are limited and food is not served warm enough ( perhaps more the fault of the waiters than that of the cooks ) . may come back during a summer or winterlicious and with granpas / granmas . perhaps also the hotel ambiance has to do with the fact that i am not that eager to go again , although i had a great dinner there .
american	locally owned , not a chain-good food and friendly service . i 've had the beef brisket and the pulled pork sandwiches . they 're both delicious but the brisket is my fave . homemade bread , homemade pickles and homemade coleslaw make for a perfect sandwich . had the bourbon spiced peaches both times because , well , bourbon spiced peaches
american	friendly staff . selections are a relative few , but the choices are good enough to enjoy a new york slice .
american	fairly diverse menu , so you dont have to have a burger , etc .
american	it 's fresh tasting and hot . you can 't beat the price , so load up and get sober . the portuguese sausage was nice .
american	havent tried many others so nothing to compare it to.enjoyed the pulled pork by the pound and love the spicy bbq sauce . drink selection kinda sucks . and once i did get a slab of ribs with 70 % fat and grissle . but overall good bbq and fast . sausage very good . a bit pricy for portion size however .
american	the beers i had were pretty amazing . i 'm not a huge ipa fan but they have it all . the pumpkin porter was really good . the food was really good and can 't wait to go back next time i visit the phoenix area .
american	staffs are nice and friendly . 4 star for the food . diffinitely coming back to taste their other breakfast menu .
american	not only can you chow down on some good omelets and other breakfast entrees but you get to see airplanes taxiing , taking off , and landing at the same time . you know a place is good when a seat is hard to come by on a saturday morning and there is no way to tell this place is there from the street . this place is deserving of repeat business from me .
american	the fact that you can have a reasonable breakfast and support a good organization made this place a winner for us .
american	very accommodating for substitutions to the menu . waitress was very attentive and friendly . will definitely come back if in the area again . not many breakfast places nearby so this is worth a try .
american	the orange juice was pre squeezed into mason jars ready for serving . a little on the sour side , but still fresh none the less .
american	it 's nice to be somewhere where there 's no more slot machine noises .
american	they get the hot dogs right and the fries are nice and crispy .
american	the chicken is made fresh- takes about 10 minutes- but well worth the wait ! it has a crispy skin , hot and juicy on the inside , but not greasy at all . the crinkle cut fries as well as the sweet potato fries are the bomb ! the food is awesome , the prices are very reasonable , and this is now a weekly lunch place for us ! you must check this place out ! ! !
american	their prime rib , shrimp and egg station are on point ! their mimosas are free flowing and their service is great ! the dining area is clean and spacious . it 's located a few steps from the hotel elevators and the casino . their best night for dinner is friday since its seafood night ! crab legs ...
american	the meat was cooked well and the options for condiments was much better than the typical burger joint . the place is pretty new , and is still immaculate and looks like it is organized pretty well .
american	juicy , tasty , and cooked to perfection . good job
american	fresh burger keeps it simple , stupid . no over exorbitant offering of a million toppings . just where it counts most and that is the fresh grind daily ground beef . having frequented this place and location in the last 2 years , i can honestly say things are consistent . i 've never been disappointed , not even once by the taste . fries have been off once or twice , but hey , i 'm here for the burger , not the fries . best part , i don 't have way , way overly greasy hands and feel bloated unlike some other burger joints out there that charge $ 10 just for the burger alone .
american	you start out with the right ingredients : kind employees who are hard-working add in foods made with fresh , basic , hand cut toppings and fresh cut fries and you get the best there is to offer . this review is less about the food ( which in my opinion is burger perfection ) and more about the service . every time i walk into five guys on howe road i am greeted with a smile , the employees are patient kind and hard-working . it 's no wonder the restaurant is always busy , but , they work so hard the wait is hardly ever too long . i will continue to go back repeatedly and you should too .
american	it 's a clean friendly environment with a pleasant staff . bacon is expensive !
american	the french-inspired chain restaurants offer hearty portions of comfort food at reasonable prices . i had the " meatloaf & mash , " which consisted of a generous slice of the house-made loaf , creamy mashed potatoes with a tasty gravy and a medley of fresh vegetables . the service was exceptional , and the environment was cozy and comfortable .
american	little bit of a wait , but for fresh chicken it 's worth it ! ! ! i love their country gravy and the ranch is amazing too . love the fact they have a drive thru !
american	thanks to earl of sandwich you are still able to find an affordable meal in sin city . i had their holiday sandwich and my husband had their blt . both of us were more than satisfied . my husband 's only complaint was that the sandwich wasn 't big enough for his appetite but for me it was perfect ! we wish we had ordered a sandwich to go for the ride home .
american	italian beef , dogs , fries ... it 's all good . this is the sort of place you can depend on to get the food the way you remember it .
american	i love the setup of the patio and how open it is . the lights above us were out so we moved tables , and they fixed it pretty quickly . their menu seems to change often , or maybe it just appears that way to me . i ordered the grilled veggie sandwich and the sedona tortilla soup . both were delicious and the sandwich was just as good the next day . my brother ordered the tortilla rolls appetizer , i liked the mediterranean veggie one with peanut sauce . i tried the kung pao spaghetti with shrimp from my mom , i will have to order that next time . good service and affordable prices .
american	) was perfection. and yes , i 'm also a little embaressed that i ordered a salad , ( i 'm really not one of those girls that orders salad at dinner ) but really it was what i wanted and it was good goshdarnit ! so leave the judgment aside and move along ...
american	good bar food and great service- our server cathy hernandez was one of the best we 've ever had !
american	seems a big hit for birthday party groups . serves a decent prime rib .
american	want to assemble a cool vegan cheese tray ? this would be your go-to place . i tried the vegan chocolate chip cookie , and it was good . service was great and friendly as well . thanks the market for having some healthier choices .
american	for an airport restaurant , they are actually a pretty good value and it 's nice to have some local flavor . bbq chopped chicken , baked beans and green beans were all steaming hot . sauce was a little sweet for my taste .
american	i always get the box with chx , toast , fries , slaw and sauce . they keep it simple with " one love " not trying to serve everything in an inexpensive fast food restaurant . i know very few people that dont care for canes but they are the same ones who like and or review subway , wendys and bk ... too funny .
american	the wings were good too . the staff was " talented ..... " and attentive .
american	it 's got the dark , rich steak house atmosphere without the heavy and pretentious menu . usual favorites are the ribs , thai steak salad , and the salmon . the salad in particular is worth a visit . it is a complex menagerie of several flavors that blend very well . among them are mango , avocado , tomato , mint , basil , cilantro , and a superb dressing .
american	made to look like a traditional nyc-style deli , greenberg 's does not disappoint with its selection of traditional offering , served in generous portions , and most for only about $ 9 . i got a hot corned beef on rye with spice brown mustard , two pickles , and potato salad . i 'm usually content paying $ 12-16 for that since that is what it usually costs . but here my total ( incl tax ) was $ 8.59 . the sandwich was delicious , very satisfying . definitely worth stopping by for a good , cheap lunch .
american	i 'd visit this spot again , good tasting food for a good price . i had pancakes , eggs & cornbeef hash ... the cornbeef hash was delicious & not out of a can so i recommend you try it . the place has an old school diner feel and is located in the lobby of a building with no outside view .
american	tons of tv 's which are viewable from nearly any angle you sit in the restaurant including a large tv with the main game on . even though it was packed when we were there , staff was still friendly and fairly attentive given the crowd . food was actually good and the beer was about average price of any place else in town . i will most likely be back to this bar for more games in the future .
american	the crew was mostly on and with it . is it just me or does their sweet tea need to be cut 50 / 50 to avoid instant sugar shock ?
american	i have to say its neither worst or best buffet . i enjoy the breakfast items especially the french toast . i love that they 're one of the last buffets to have chocolate milk and not charge extra for it . i was really impressed with the new desserts . but any place that had unlimited bacon , you have my vote.lol. great spot if you 're single or with a group .
american	wish we could have received a better table with a view versus being stuck in the very back corner of the restaurant ( i had used open table to make reservations and due to the fact this was an anniversary dinner requested a table with a view ) . despite this , service was very good and the food was as well - a bit overpriced , but very good .
american	it delivers good food and as has a balanced wine list . the appetizers we selected were the novia scotia lobster salad and the duck salad and they were good . and the two entrees we had were the sea bass and the lamb - tasty and well presented . we had sides of brussel sprouts which were delightful ; the onion rings had just a little too much batter for our liking . we enjoyed a clos village pinot noir which was drinking well . there were times that one felt like it was a business you were eating in not a restaurant , and the ' foodie ' experience suffered a little .
american	i would liken it to a firehouse subs if subway were the low end sandwich shop . good quality , fast , and friendly . the front staff was very helpful and made a couple of suggestions as to portion sizing mid-order that really helped out my wallet and waist line . i would frequent this spot for a quick lunch if i lived local . location is super clean as well !
american	the hot dog with chili was very good . the dog " snapped " with lots of flavor . i licked out with the chili . it had no beans . that 's the only way i like it . good chili . the place is on a main st in an old town that needs revitalizing . but when it does it will be a " go to " local .
american	most recently we went on a monday night . they half-priced bottles of wine on mondays . we got the ahi tuna appetizer . it never disappoints . the spicy mustard and the mixed greens salad pair perfectly with the tuna . we also had a blt salad . that dressing .. yum ! for my entree , i tried the sesame crusted salmon for the first time . it was perfectly cooked . the greenbeans and mashed potatoes we 're fab too . try the cheesecake ! !
american	it was very busy - the parking lot was absolutely packed - but surprisingly , we didn 't have to wait . the food was delicious , and the service was absolutely excellent . the restaurant itself was very clean and had a cozy , chic atmosphere . there is an outdoor patio and fire that i can 't wait to experience this spring / summer / fall . we 'll definitely be back !
american	i live in california and i thought we had good halal spots . but this place sets a high standard compared to some cali spots . the owner is very humble and his crew cooks very good , the meat is seasonsed well , and is cooked to tenderous perfection . the portion sizes are great for the price , no complaints at all , this is definitely on my top eatery spots in vegas
american	in love with the fattoush which is perfect in everyway , fresh with just the right amount of lemon , sumac and olive oil . the hummus is so delicious with just the right amount of tahini for my taste . i love getting a meal that satisfies both my hunger and doesn 't shock at the register . can 't forget about the friendly , competent service ! also nice to get a peek into the kitchen and find everyone laughing , smiling and enjoying themselves . i think there is a direct connection between the happiness of the cook and the quality of the food - just my experience !
american	food is good quality-- not exactly cheap , but not expensive . nice view overlooking the creek , especially in the spring and fall .
american	we 've both lived in the willoughby area our entire lives but this was our first visit ! both of the servers working were so kind and attentive . when we told them it was our first visit , they told us the history of the building and even played us a song on the jukebox . the food was absolutely delicious . i had chocolate chip pancakes ( so fluffy & huge ! ) and the best home fries i 've ever tasted . my friend had a veggie omelette which she also loved ! we will definitely be back !
american	the b3 burger was fantastic , and the bison & fontina quesadillas were excellent as well . the staff are friendly , there are plenty of drink options , and the food is great . you simply can 't ask for more . i 'm looking forward to many more visits !
american	and i did really like it . the design is fashion forward . the menu is creative . and the service was pretty friendly . we waited for about 50 minutes , which seems to be on par . so we started with bloody mary 's , and one blackberry bubbler . for breakfast we had four entrées at our table . ( see pics . ) the waiter seemed not to know that the kitchen would do tofu scramble subbed for eggs . i would come back again but i would not wait longer than 20 minutes .
american	this is my 4th time here and every time i have thoroughly enjoyed my experience . the food is amazingly fresh and the service is great . i 've tried my fair share of food and i 'm yet to find something that wasn 't great . the onion rings are a standout item that i would definitely recommend and the fontina burger is also a staple . i 've eaten next door at their other restaurant named ' the coffee shop ' and i loved it just as much . i 've heard great things about joe 's bbq , but haven 't had a chance to give it a try yet ... but it 's next on my list .
american	this place is downright delicious ! ... who cares about their old fashion decor when their pizza is that good ! it 's a little bit of a hike to get to if you don 't live in cave creek but it is definitely worth the drive .
american	for being in the desert the lobster was wonderful i had the ucon roll it was simple and yummy ! chunks of lobster on a toasted roll with melted butter and fries . the lobster was cooked perfect and tasted awesome ! i followed it up with a cup of lobster bisque creamy and hot loved it ! stole a hush puppy from my friend and it was awesome too , also got to try the lobster quesadilla , everything we tried was great . i would recommend this place anytime and to those who say the sandwich didn 't have a pound and fourth of lobster should know lobster is sold and weighed in the shell so that adds to it just fyi
american	but expect to wait in 30min-1hr lines or longer if you have a big party . service is over the top ! fries are good but not outstanding . jalapeno poppers were probably my favorite part of the meal . i didn 't really think it was a better burger than i get in my favorite burger joint back home . and this was twice the cost . on the other hand , its pretty cool to eat at a gordon ramsey restaurant if you are a fan .
american	the portions are great and for good price . the food was great . i had loaded chili fries and it was yummy . staff was very friend , really felt like a good tean
american	location is off of i-77 on sunset .... just look for the pig in the yard ! great food , friendly staff , plenty of room inside , but good for take out as well . ribs-great chicken-great bbq is great
american	service is quick and the food is filling . for about eight dollars you get a good sized sandwich and a soup , a piece of bread and normally a chocolate dipped strawberry . instead of the strawberry right now they are giving you a chocolate dipped oreo which i actually prefer . the tables turn over quickly and they keep the tables clean and have plenty of employees to help you out .
american	the prices are very reasonable for what you get and i 'm not sure there really is another gyro place in uptown besides showmars .
american	we had the garlic beer bread to start , which was well balanced and tasty . we had the chicken & avocado beer bread wrap , chicken caprese sandwich and nemo pita . the pita had tons and tons if fish , and they were all large servings . fries are well battered and very crunchy - just the way i like them !
american	service is always good even when it is packed . the food is just good all around , we haven 't had something we didn 't like . there are a few standout wraps and the wings are very tasty . as with most places like this , stay away when there are games on tv . people screaming makes the place kind of loud during games . otherwise it 's pretty typical . if the weather is good , you can sit outside to avoid the people screaming at tvs .
american	only being open for breakfast and lunch , i 've only dined here for lunch . the dining area is large and clean . service here has dropped a bit over the last few years but the food has kept on par . their tba melt is still my usual order . turkey , bacon and avocado on sourdough is tasty ! fries on the side more than enough to satisfy my hunger . i keep hoping they add sweet potato fries to the menu to make me smile even more ! until then , they serve a good lunch with hopes the service goes back to greatness .
american	you order and pay for your food up front and it 's brought to you by a server . customer service was on point , and the food was pretty good.their sweet potato fries are delish , and the presentation of their food on wire trays is unique . so if you 're at the south premium outlets and are looking for a good burger joint but don 't want fast-food make sure you check this place out !
american	relatively few " healthy " dishes , but this is not a place one goes to for a healthy meal . pizza and salads are good , but pricy . it is located in an upscale community and the decor and prices reflect it .
american	good food . good service . good environment . relaxing .
american	a grilled dog with all the fixing and a few more , at a decent price . that 's plain good eatin . they got all sorts of stuff to eat . burgers , mac and cheese , hand made shacks , fresh onion rings and ice cream to rattle off a few . plenty of help with a good attitude . have 'ta love that . pass 'n trough to ... stop in .
american	blue plate specials of a ' meat and two ' " they cook it up good for you ! "
american	great service , good food . i especially like the pancakes . great prices , too . save yourself the trouble of waiting in line at ihop when you can enjoy a local spot . i do find the name odd for this place . it made me wonder if it was asian food or some chic kinda name that i 'm too outta touch to understand , but don 't let that scare you off . would i go back ? ... already have .
american	i don 't always go there ( cause i like variety ) , but dd is on my favorites list . why ? always crowded , but i get seated quickly . always good food . always good service . always a nice drink selection ( full bar , yo ! ) always solid . and for that i am grateful .
american	at least it felt healthy - i ordered pancakes with fresh fruit , sprinkled with powdered sugar and wheatgerm and they were very good . coffee is a bit expensive , as is the rest of the menu , but it 's very fresh and delicious . staff is friendly and attentive , and the food was served very quickly . they serve breakfast all day , as well as some wraps and sandwiches . also opening a new restaurant in solon sometime this winter . yay !
american	my advice is to start your buffet time on a late dinner . since the buffet allows you access for 24 hours , it 'll end at the time you start but the next day . if you go for a late dinner , you get dinner , breakfast , lunch , and an early dinner . four meals : ) that is if you 're not looking to eat out at the max .
american	the wait was worth it both times ( 15 and 45 mins ) . portions are huge , unique and delicious . almost every entree has some sort of unique twist . chicken n waffles were damn good as well as the bacon avocado scrambler . the place has a industrial yet clean , with a modern look and feel . the service was energetic and attentive . i would definitely plan on coming back and plan on visiting the chicago location near me in the near future .
american	$ 8 feels expensive but in comparison to other places down college ave. it seems fair . i hear the cookies are pretty good too . - i wish i can give an extra half star for the great music being played there as you wait for your order .
american	.. also love their n.y style pizza ... great pizza parlor . .
american	service was good , and the food was very nice . i had french toast , but it was the best french toast i 've had .
american	i stopped in around 1 : 30 and found a good few tables filled . i ordered the hamburger with the home fries . it was a large burger - appeared to be home made ( my preference ) , fresh bun , and all the trimmings . very tasty . my only disappointment was the coffee . it was hot , just not rich and tasty . odd for a place that touts breakfasts . another patron came in shortly after me and took a table close by . they ordered from the breakfast menu and it looked delicious - a must try for my next visit . the waitress was prompt and knew her stuff .
american	just make sure if you ask for it to be medium rare and its not , send it back . a place that makes burgers shoudl get that right . the sweet potato fries are really good as well . i think i also had the chips and they were good as well .
american	nice , but not fancy . wait staff were very friendly . lots of sports on the many large screen tvs all over the walls in the dining area , which you can ignore if you want to as they are high enough . the food was good . my roasted beet salad was excellent and the other meals in our party were prepared well . dinner for four including an appetizer and one drink from the bar was about $ 75 cad .
american	and the steak is really pretty good . coffee not bad , either . the items on the rest of the menu appeared to share one thing in common : prices 15-20 % lower than i 'd expect to pay anywhere else . good , cheerful , and cheap little diner .
american	food is consistent and service is timely sign up for the rewards club and you will get monthly coupons kids meals are good and affordable
american	service is great . the food is delicious - we had the steak tartare , foie gras , and the rib eye . a sophisticated , high-end oliver & bonaci restaurant that is worth the price .
american	i 've been for lunch a few times over the past week and the brisket burger is on point . so good ! . there 's a lot of space and it is never as crowded as town hall which is nice and i think the food is better . service is good as well . my only gripe is price and selection for lunch . the sandwich options are limited and there are no wraps . the entree 's are expensive for lunch . i 'm not spending $ 18- $ 21 on a lunch entrée . $ 18 for pierogies when you when sokolowski 's is down the road isn 't reasonable and $ 17 for mac n cheese is crazy .
american	the fame is well deserved though . the portions are big and the prices cheap , the best combo . i enjoy the burritos , good filing and size . the atmosphere is very homey if a little dirty but still a good place to go for a late breakfast .
american	service was great . or server always made sure we had bread and drinks . she even brought us out a to go cup to take back to work . i love the buy one get one special . mostly because by the time i eat the salad and brad sticks i am full . luckily i live leftovers .
american	with very good food . they are a little pricey but you really do get what you pay for . i would say that it is a little loud and the lighting is dim ans the lights do flash at times , so make sure your kid is okay with that . other than that it 's a fun experience .
american	fresh food , excellent hot pita bread , amazing humus . you can find healthy options of you keep on " clean " food diet : chicken skew with steamed broccoli along with big israeli salad . in my healthy ranking of gets 5 stars . enjoy .
american	a good place for outdoor dining , great key lime pie
american	the items are simply prepared , and if you 're a health nut , you 'll love it . service is what you 'd expect for a restaurant in an high-end hotel like the shangri-la -- it 's flawless .
american	new yorker burger is great . remember to grab napkins before you leave ! they put rocket sauce and their special coleslaw on many of their items . both are delicious , but make for a messy experience . we also love the mini corn dogs . large portions of everything , especially the fries ( one side is totally enough for 2 adults ) . they have every soda you could ever want , even faygo which is hard to find outside of michigan . they 've also added taps with craft soda . cool place , not for those on a diet lol : d
american	comfy , clean and quiet , a place to get a good nights rest . we had a good dinner in the attached restaurant but i 'd skip the breakfast the next time . i had the worst pancakes - little greasy circles of rubber . inedible .
american	but otherwise a relatively short menu . the burgers are huge and well prepared . several standard options . ( i like the signature burger with grilled onions , mushrooms and american cheese . ) be aware , fries are not included and have to be ordered . lots of good wings . when it 's busy , ask for your wings well done . i like the around the corner signature wings . a black pepper rub with some mildly spicy butter sauce . may be one of the best wings in the area . monday is 2 for 1 burger night . such a deal !
american	the breakfast food was good . i had the hawaii breakfast special . the large plate of food came with eggs , pineapple , sausages , and rice . the rice doesn 't seem to fit . the food was great and hit the spot . oh yeah , don 't skip over the fresh made banana nut muffins . they were delicious .
american	we went there for convenience and variety . the server was super friendly and attentive . you could tell that she likes what she 's doing . the food took a while , but that was ok considering that it was packed . the ac must have been on its last legs since it was uncomfortably warm . but we are in arizona . the food was ok , but i was a little disappointed about the size . all in all four stars out of five seems fair .
american	the place had a casual- kicked back diner atmosphere . our server was really nice and helped us pick our food from the menu ( there were an array of mouth watering foods to choose from ) the food is just worth your $ $ ! just the appetizer alone was enough to fill our starving tummies ! the entree was great but the dessert is where the money is at ! ! will definitely come back here to eat .
american	you don 't have to have a boarding pass as it is before the check in area . pricey for what you get but our flight was delayed 2 hours so it was worth the money if you don 't have airline lounge memberships . staff was very friendly
american	they serve their burgers with side items like beans and coleslaw . i have to say this is the best bbq place i 've had in awhile .
american	service was very friendly . lots of television monitors . food was adequate and filling . i had a turkey wrap that was quite satisfying . our server was a funny guy . just came for a meal and not for the drinks .
american	the staff is friendly , the sides are fresh and the veggie burgers are delish . there 's a wide variety of condiments , from spicy barbecue sauce to guacamole and cajun onions . per the review that mentioned " overcooked , " i eat there a lot and i 've never had that issue . they serve new york fries ( tasty ! ) but even better are the onion rings . mmmmmm ... crispy and hot . my only complaint is that the salads are truly " meh , " being just some lettuce with a few onion bits and four tomato chunks . but i tolerate that for the veggie burgers and onion rings .
american	i recommend everyone to try their lamb shank meal and the tandoori chicken and for people who love spicy food , try their hot sauce it 's super tasty .
american	some good specials but since we had a groupon we splurged for dinner . there were two of us and we got the full rack of ribs and some apps . they ( without us even asking ! ) split the ribs into two portions and served them to us on two plates , each with fries and slaw ! very cool . the ribs were tender , meat slid right off the bone . servers refilled our sodas frequently ! i kinda thought the mac and cheese app was " meh " but my gf loved the popcorn shrimp ( which comes in a hot wing sauce with bleu cheese crumbles )
american	very unassuming exterior that leads to friendly waitstaff and tasty breakfast entrees with interesting mimosas .
american	the menu is plentiful , they have just about anything you want to eat . you get breakfast ( breakfast burrito ) the way to go . pizza for lunch ( pepperoni ) is good , and for dinner the half pound angus burger . food , customer service , and employee 's are great ! ! ! ! thank you guys ! ! !
american	i have found they have good food and good service . this seems to be consistent from visit to visit . plus , i love good greek food ! i would recommend that you give this place a try because i think you will enjoy it . when you go in - tell them that chris from yelp recommended you go there . they will have no idea who the hell i am but it might provide some interesting entertainment and a good laugh or two ! enjoy !
american	i have found they have good food and good service . this seems to be consistent from visit to visit . they have great tasting hot dogs and brats with a wide variety of toppings all for about $ 6 to $ 7 per dog . i would recommend that you give this place a try because i think you will enjoy it . when you go in - tell them that chris from yelp recommended you go there . they will have no idea who the hell i am but it might provide some interesting entertainment and a good laugh or two ! enjoy !

american	the sandwiches are uniquely packaged and yummy ! the inside was clean and designed for in-and-out customers . the service was great and the manager came to each table to greet and ask about the food . i will come back again .
american	there is a variety of foods from healthy oatmeal or greek yogurt to your typical pancakes and omelette . their coffee has unlimited refills , is very delicious but does cost $ 5 a pop . in general , this is not a cheap place but you are at the wynn so expect to pay extra . service was attentive and our waiter was good looking which is a plus for us 5 girls on our girls weekend !
american	to boot , their food is commensurate with their prices . this is one of my go to places for a healthy comfort food when downtown . additionally , their patio comes in handy in the summer .
american	the place is a little difficult to pull in and out . the sheetz is busy so be ready to wait a little . very friendly staff with quick service .
american	the counter service ordering at the old gulf stream trailer is fun and the food is good bar food with some imagination . i really like the korean spiced wings-a good fried chicken wing with a tangy sauce with a little heat . lobster roll sandwich tasted good and the beers are cold with a good selection of craft and macro selections from everywhere .
american	eggs cooked to order , nice crispy bacon , and good service .
american	service was quick and polite and the food was above a regular burger joint. garlic fires and sweet potato fries are the way to go .
american	always very busy . don 't confuse the midwest chilli with cincinnati chilli . it is not over spaghetti .
american	it is very pretty inside . i thought the food was good . sweet potato fries were really yummy . we had the calamari and then i had a chicken caesar salad it was goood . my husband wasn 't too thrilled with the place he just thought it was ok . he has one of the specials he didn 't really care for it . he does not want to go back . i would but i will probably end up going back with friends haha
american	you can never go wrong with a pound bag of shrimp with the whole shabang sauce ! the best part of this location ? the wait , as in there is no wait ! if you go to a location in sj or socal , the wait can get pretty long . i 've had to wait up to 2 hours before ! come here and you 'll most likely get a seat immediately ! if you don 't feel like getting your hands messy , definitely get the catfish with cajun fries ! honestly , the fries are one of my favorite parts here : )
american	relatively small but the wait if any usually goes fast , not located in the most convenient of places but still worth a trip for something different that won 't disappoint . with the owner actively walking the floor greeting the patrons and checking on their needs it reminiscent of time when that sort of behavior was the norm opposed to the exception as it is today . good service and decent food makes mr. mama 's an obvious choice for those in the area .
american	had the : prosciutto pizza tuna tartare seafood risotto pork chop halibut quick service . good food . good times .
american	i 've always found something good to get when eating at cracker barrel . definitely worth giving a try if you 've never been there before .
american	i 'm here most weekends for brunch . check out the awesome breakfast sandwich . so good i crave it
american	this place has always been clean and neat , especially the bathrooms . the service by the waitstaff has been perfect and the manager listens to all issues . the hostess / host has a lot to be desired , but please don 't hold that against the rest of the staff . i recommend breakfast over lunch or dinner here , but otherwise , i have no complaints .
american	staff was friendly and fast and food was good . had the brisket and gnocci which was unique but very tasty . my parents had the salmon burger and pulled pork sandwich which they though was good . draft beer selection was above average . recommend for lunch if you are visiting the carnegie must end or in the area for lunch !
american	just to set expectations - nothing fancy but prepared with care , served quickly and friendly staff . typical breakfast fare of eggs , pancakes , etc. they do have some lunch selections such as sandwiches and salads . definitely recommend this small business to someone that is looking for a nice meal .
american	the burger and fries are a solid cut above fast food but just off the level of a dedicated burger joint like five guys . that said they have great assortment on the menu with probably some of the best chicken fingers i 've had that get breaded in store before your eyes . i haven 't had the chicken wings yet but from what i 've seen they look great .
american	a tad on the pricey side , however . their schtick is they don 't serve " junk , " as the waiter called it . so that means only organic sodas , homemade sauces , etc . they do make all of their own ketchup mustard , pickles , and sell them as well . some of their sauces are spectacular . i also really enjoy their fries , here . they also do special events , i think , as i have seen karaoke for a birthday party in here as well as watched a ufc .
american	not the best , but it has a lot going for it . the waitstaff was good , the view was good , and the setting was different . the salads were made w / fresh greens , etc . , the dressing was excellent , and the steak tender . the only drawback to the steak is that it could have had more flavor ; on the other hand , my partner said her steak had good flavor . go figure . the dessert was outstanding .
american	the chef 's table , open to the kitchen seems be kept free for walk-in , even during lunch rush hours , that 's where we sat . high recommend the changeable set menu , with app , entree & desert @ $ 21 . food was delicious and the service was really personable .
american	really enjoy the pitas here . reasonably priced with access from mall exterior .
american	i always opt for the lunch special ( $ 5.99 ) , which is an affordable offering of either fried , bbq , or jerk chicken , served on rice and peas with salad / coleslaw . all of which i have tasted and can verify that they are tasty and will fill one up until the next meal . i find that this particular location seems to always be more generous with their portions and are friendly as well .
american	) . my wife and i shared a ny strip , which was sliced for us and served exactly as ordered-very juicy with a natural charred edge . we also shared the brussels sprouts side , which was good as well-shaved sprouts with a little balsamic mixed in and some parmesan baked in . good service and they do exactly what you expect in a classic steakhouse model .
american	there was a very slight wait ( about 5 mins ) , but it 's the peak sunday brunch time , so it is not bad at all . as for the service , it was good . we were seated and taken care of and the waitress recommended couple of things off the menu . i ordered the green eggs and ham , and a slide of french toast . the food was good but not great . typical american brunch place , food may not be the healthiest and the portion was plenty but not huge to a point that you feel wasting food or over-stuffing yourself . recommended , good stop for a causal , chill-axing brunch
american	a good sized sandwich for a reasonable price . i like the senior discount that they give . the staff was polite and the sandwich was made quickly . all of the ingredients seemed fresh and the bread was soft . i still think jimmy johns is better , but this place comes in a close second . jimmy johns seems to give you more meat , but i didn 't weigh the product from both places to verify that . but i would definitely come here again .
american	anybody who tries to bring new york pizza to az is ok in my book . place is small , 7 or 8 tables and typical mom and pop pizza shop ambiance . that 's fine with me .
american	rise & shine has expanded in more ways than one . the original restaurant in southern highlands was recently remodeled and not only seats more folks , but it now features a specialty juice bar / latte station . no need to stop my starbucks before entering here . additionally , a second store is now open in summerlin ; although , i have yet to visit . what can i say , i like to stick close to home in the mornings .
american	the wait time was bearable , and the service was pretty good , which was not expected given how busy it was . we ordered a couple of beers & tried out the butter chicken pizza for the first time . the butter chicken pizza was gone in less than a minute ! ! it was a good portion size , light ( flatbread ) and i 'd definitely go back
american	we had everything and split it and passed it around . mushroom burger , pig wings ? ( pig wings ? ) great ! tator tots really ! where else can you get tator tots . mac & cheese , a blue cheese wedge , and a chili burger . e erything was good and hot . we gave the server a run for her money - unintentionally but my group was needy .... so sorry for the trouble .
american	a good to for our family when we 're looking for a great burger and beer list .
american	large portions and good food ! ! coffee is a little weak but i 'm just a coffee snob : - )
american	$ 23 for lunch . the spicy tuna rolls are great and are made to order . the st. louis ribs are well flavored but not exactly " fall off the bone . " there are a lot of healthy choices to help you recover from late night festivities and their dessert selection are plentiful and tasty . i give this 4 out 5 because the wynn buffet is 5 out 5 but you will pay a premium for it .
american	they also use hoffy or vienna beef brand dogs . a dog , chips and a drink will definitely fill you up . every dog has a lot of toppings on it even the most simplest one . also have sliders and waffle desserts . friendly family owned business always a good thing to see .
american	burger was good . nice beer selection . a fun sports bar atmosphere .
american	the mushroom bisque was the best out of the three we had ! a good sized greek salad rounded out the meal . we also got a huge fruit salad for five dollars . hoping to get the confit chicken wings the next time we are in town .
american	the lobster benedict for sunday brunch was amazing . love how the inside is decorated like a farm house
american	nothing fancy and nothing healthy . just the good stuff
american	a small patio outside to enjoy the weather , and cute cafe tables on the inside . we had no wait even over the xmas / new years holiday at prime lunch hour . excellent service , very tasty lunch fare , and reasonable prices . i would definitely return here , and would try dinner or an afternoon tea as well .
american	but come hungry , cause the plates are plentiful . the eggs benedict are great , and the mac and cheese lives up to the hype .
american	the menu is constantly changing , and it is great if you just want something for lunch for yourself or if you need to get something for the whole family for dinner . you can 't go wrong with any of their soups . and the bread is always super fresh ! also super affordable ... it 's making me hungry just thinking about it . good thing i 'm planning to go for lunch in a few days . yum !
american	a ' go to ' for me on weekends when i can 't be bothered making coffee ... very cute and quaint little place showcasing local artists .
american	keeps us fueled up and ready for action . one of us loves the triple with bacon . we all get the burgers as lettuce wraps , tastes great and the staff are fantastic !
american	things i 've had : smoothies : almost more than i can drink steak and fries : cooked a bit more than i had asked but they don 't skimp on the veggies ham and cheese omelette : carmelized onions in an omelette ? amazing ! chipotle chicken on spelt toast : avocado makes most things good . nice alternative to a classic club . super chill atmosphere , movie poster decor is amusing . yes , it gets crowded on weekends and i have had to wait upwards of 45mins to get a table . but what good brunch / brekky joint doesn 't have a line ?
american	the food is always decent . service is usually pretty good but this time we got a lukewarm experience . when the waiter realized we didn 't want to order an appetizer he just disappeared the rest of our time there . i had the steak frites au poivre which was good . the portion size was pretty big and i was quite full afterwards . my boyfriend had the steak with the bordelaise sauce and he loved it . we will definitely come back .
american	they have an extensive . menu with lots of healthy choices ... like make your own yoghurt parfait with fresh berries . also have all the traditional items as well - and make sure you try the " pot-o-bread " - yum !
american	love how their home fries are made , small cubes with sauteed onions and the wrap was on point , the chicken was not too dry and just right . good price for their food , lots to choose from in the menu . definitely will go again : )
american	although we all have a favorite menu item , any time we try something new we always enjoy it . the falafel and hummus are great appetizers . the ever-changing desserts are delicious as well . the food always tastes so fresh , the staff is friendly , and the service is fast . i cannot count the amount of times i have been here , and not once have i had a complaint . will continue to be an easy decision when looking for a restaurant that i know will not disappoint .
american	sage is a cafeteria style soup-n-sandwich joint in an old house on mccaul . grab one of the tasty wraps and head to a table in the back . in an area of the city without too much character ( at least for restaurants ) sage is a nice place for a casual lunch out during the week .
american	1 slider = $ 3 , 2 sliders = $ 5 , 3 sliders = $ 7. though , i question its sustainability due to its ( lack thereof ) marketing strategy. twitter-ups are effective only to create a buzz ; however eventually every business in order to grow needs to operate out of a brick and mortar .
american	excellent crust . the sweet pizza sauce is trademark . prices are fair . great mom and pop spot that continues to deliver .
american	we stopped for a drink at the bar while they prepared a table for us by the window . a window seat here is worth the wait , with views overlooking the bellagio fountains that i really never get tired of watching . service from our waiter was professional , but not warm nor inviting . apps : seared sea scallops were great . forget what else was ordered . entrees : liked the dover sole , loved the beef wellington , which was cooked perfectly and full of flavor . dessert : highly recommend trying a souffle ... amazing . a nice , romantic restaurant that i would recommend trying .
american	the food is simple , basic but done well . service is always prompt & friendly . a friend and i meet here for weekday lunch frequently . we are met with a warm atmosphere & treated with appreciation . * note : a decent selection of vegetarian food options .
american	i luv this place . the food is all fresh ... ham is cut off of a real ham , not some pressed deli meat . the bacon is thick and the potato 's are sliced right there behind the counter before being tossed on the grill to become home fries . it doesn 't appear that any corners are cut . the portions are large too ... have breakfast here in the morning and there 's no need to schedule lunch . o 'leary 's is about as good as it gets for a working class breakfast . my only complaint is that they are cash only ; no credit cards accepted .
american	this place reminds me of the midwest staple diner , full of good food and great people . david and i have been here several times and tried multiple menu items . everything has been wonderful . i 'm partial to their pancakes which don 't sit in my stomach like a sack of lead as is the case with other pancakes i 've had . the bacon is good , too .
american	service is good and the atmosphere is always pretty relaxed . it 's the perfect place in the neighbourhood if you want to get breakfast at 3pm - on a budget .
american	but at $ 6.95 for a 16oz burger and fries , you absolutely can 't go wrong . not a gourmet burger , but made with angus beef and prepared to order . mine was delicious . yeah , i 've had an expensive kobe beef burger elsewhere , but this isn 't what bellwood bar and grill is all about . to find a flaw at this price is ridiculous . when in the mood for greasy spoon food at unbelievable prices , this is your spot . period .
american	very romantic ambience on the outside patio with multiple fireplaces and a fountain ..... and the food / service was excellent ! ! ! ! !
american	free coffee on sunday while you wait in the brunch line . pretty good service . there is a patio for nice days , though not much of a view . the food is great ... still not sure why the biscuits are the signature ' thing ' but otherwise the menu is solid . now they need to take one uptown !
american	the food is much better than what you can get elsewhere for the same price . there are many options - freshly made pizza , sandwiches , pasta , salads , sushi and entrees . the fries are unbeatable . the employees are friendly and helpful . i highly recommend kafeteria .
american	finally a non-chain restaurant that serves up tasty healthy options . the guy behind the counter is very kind . i hope this place takes off ! the gyro is quite tasty and i devoured the pita crutons on my salad . i also enjoyed the oil / vinegar type dressing they use - it had the perfect zing to it . i am a repeat customer here .
american	some things on the menu are a bit pricy for a college town but i like having the option to splurge on awesome food . it 's hard to find a parking space near by but it 's worth the walk .
american	a very large menu , so if you have a hard time making up your mind at a restaurant like i do , allow some extra time . they seem to always have some kind of interesting special items . really great bread . my husband always gets the skillet hash and loves that . my favorite item is the farm house tacos which are small soft tacos with eggs , chorizo , salsa and avacado . they usually come with chicken , but i usually get them without since i 'm not a fan . always great service . a little pricey , but worth it .
american	we appreciate the family friendly atmosphere , yet very enjoyable for adults . kids eat free is always a bonus , especially with great options ! ! ! ! we 've tried several salads and other menu items that have been really good . also there are gluten free options ! the wait staff is friendly and attentive . if you are local , i 'd recommend " liking " them on facebook , as they often post specials ( game day , etc . ) . if you are missing a game ( due to your cable provider ) - it will most likely be on at cf . check them out !
american	a friend and i stopped in january 9 , 2015 for breakfast . the coffee was great the pancakes were a thing of beauty and the breakfast sandwich very good . prices were below any other cave creek restaurant . outstanding rd evans
american	i generally work late and hit this place on my way home . the staff is always friendly and certainly not bitter about a late order which i really appreciate . the food is solid for bar food and i 've had a pretty decent variety of things off their menu . good burger . good fish sammich . good fries . definitely glad to have this place in the neighborhood .
american	a real family affair , with tasty home style cooking . it would be a 5 star place when they get the facility up to speed . third visit today , continue to be consistently good , even if the facility needs work .
american	they take their concept seriously . drinks were exquisite . had something sweet ( but not too sweet ) called hazel 's lemons and then the dirty barchef from the " savoury " list . really , who needs food , but the carpaccio with guacamole / corn chips was excellent too .
american	had a wonderful dinner last night and most importantly we could actually hear each other , a rare commodity these days in new restaurants . it is very comfortable as the tables are not jammed in against each other . all four people ( and despite what b.l. says , we are all foodies ) really enjoyed our meals : ne clam chowder , fish stew ( not exactly traditional ) , jambalaya and an excellent pork chop .
american	excellent food . the pork is eastern nc style , which is not my preference , but everything else is so good . there are not many places that serve burnt ends , and it 's worth going to midwood just for that . their smoked wings are really good , and the banana pudding is delicious . the only problem is that it gets crowded and there is a wait during peak hours , but what else would you expect ?
american	unique flavors and fresh ingredients . we were pleasantly surprised at how much we liked this place . the mezza platter was excellent . the restaurant could use more exciting pita bread or whole wheat pita . the molukhia was interesting with spiced greens over chicken . the owner was willing to custom a dish for me and checked in with us after the meal .
american	serving locally roasted coffee including roastery of cave creek - " roc2 " to go with their delicious pastries !
american	the dining and patio areas were nice and well kept . the staff were extremely helpful and friendly . i love that i can order my burger protein , or green style as they called it . their chocolate custard was heavenly ! we will go back . i wish they had sweet potato fries !
american	with no other greek restaurants around , i was very excited to try this place when it opened . reasonably priced for the gyros and the fries are so tasty . not as comparable to greek town , but still one of the best souvluki 's i ever tried . definitely give this place a try for lunch or dinner . you won 't be disappointed . there are seats - but , this place does get busy during meal times ! so , it might be best to have your meal to go !
american	the portions are huge ! ! they are open 24 / 7 another plus .
american	i love the giant yellow door and marque lighting of the name . it has a very new york feel to it and is very spacious inside . all the space keeps it easy to talk even when it is very full . i had the cevechi and really enjoyed it but the highlight was the stuffed sea bass . it was phenomenal . probably my favourite fish dish in the city and this says something given how much i love seafood . they make a fantastic old fashioned and the service was attentive and warm .
american	took my family here for sunday dinner , and want to give tanner , and rachel , our server and his trainee , and the whole crew a shout out ! the food was delicious and the service was second to none ! thanks for a fabulous dinning experience . am recommending you to all my friends ! see you soon , e smith .
american	very popular with locals in the area and is always busy on weekends for breakfast . large portions so go hungry ! prices are reasonable and the waitresses are always friendly . their souvlaki is great as well as their breakfasts .
american	glad that restaurants like this are getting attention as it helps raise awareness for the importance of healthy living .
american	absolutely as good as the other go-to places in las vegas . i eat at the counter because the staff is so friendly . i typically get the veggie omelette with egg whites , and i havent been disappointed . the price is really reasonable as well . go check it out !
american	a great alternative when u get tired of being gouged for price. we typically don 't eat chan restaurants but outback is our only exception. as usual food quality was great. service is always good however , douglas was one the best of the various outbacks that we have experienced. great job douglas !
american	a little pricy , but i hope this place is here to stay . it reminds me of the lux , where it 's multiple things in one . there is a bar inside and outside , dining area , and an area in the back called marketplace for juice and breakfast . the entire place is massive . i live close by , so i 'll be back for sure .
american	the burger is the best in the valley . also like the blt with great fries . you won 't be disappointed with other items on the menu . the service is just great .
american	what 's not to like ! plus , it 's right across the street from our office in skysong , so a great place to stop at when i am out in az on a business trip . plenty roomy in the inside as well as outside patio , and the open design is quite eye catching . i 've already stopped in a few times on recent trips out to the az office , and will make sure to do so each and every visit !
american	a great atmosphere and a great food experience and def will be back .. very busy on the weekends
american	the protein bowls are a great place to start if you haven 't been here before . their pressed juices are also great . i 'd suggest the kale cleanse . if you are there before noon the breakfast burritos are my favorite .
american	you can really tell that it 's a labor of love . whenever we go , we try to swing by on a thursday because that 's when they debut their experimental brews . my old faithful is their brown ale and we refill a couple of growlers of it every visit . i 'm trying to get them to bring back this delightful pear concoction , so feel free to petition with me : )
american	super healthy meals and drinks . i got the kale salad and absolutely loved it . i highly recommend this place .
american	i went here with a friend about a week ago and loved it ! we went during happy hour and snacked on some pretzels and sangria , then ordered some salads . a little on the pricey side if you 're going for dinner , but totally worth it . i definitely plan on going here again . the menus big , but you can 't go wrong .
american	the apples are first rate and easy to pick . they have wonderful cider . and the pumpkins are less than anywhere in cleveland . take the kids and have a great day . it is impossible not to .
american	b. great service from megan . c. fun atmosphere inside and on the patio . d. kilt lifter draft beer was perfect !
american	the only problem is there is no coat check .
american	with large portions of mouth-watering , fall-off-the-bone ribs , succulent pulled pork and side dishes that work oh so well , shane 's rib shack is one of the best bbq places i 've been to in quite some time . for a chain , it exceeded my expectations . would definitely eat here again !
american	friendly staff , a large menu of choices , tasty cocktails . the food is fresh and delicious , and the atmosphere is rustic and fun . i 'll be back for sure !
american	the homemade medium bbq sauce is legit ( just the right amount of kick ) . you can taste the smoke on the pulled pork and beef brisket . the mac ' n cheese is some of the best i have ever had . the cheese had the perfect amount of gooey to it . our server was awesome as well . she gave us a sample of the bbq sauce to try before ordering and was wonderful to talk with . i will absolutely return when in the area again .
american	this place fits the bill ! a cute little spot with great beers on tap , good service . had a yummy sour from destihl and a $ 7 mikkeller beer flight ( which i thought was a great deal since their beers are so pricey ) . didn 't try any food , but the menu looked good . i will be back !
american	this lolo 's is a bit classier than the original , though the food is still just as down-home delish ! i do prefer the original restaurant 's vibe , but this locale worked well for our trio today . the chicken was tender , crunchy , and savory and the waffles were golden brown sweet heaven . the grits were fluffy and oh so buttery , while the candied sweets stole the show . staff and service are friendly , young , and efficient . great meal , thank you lolo 's . don 't worry ... we 'll be back . : )
american	we really enjoyed the waffles ( cinnamon apple ) and petinos potatoes , both unique dishes . not too busy , frequent coffee refills . will return again for sure .
american	excellent food -- the breakfast burrito is stellar , as is the french toast . at lunch the bacon cheddar burger is excellent , and if you enjoy wraps you need to try the turkey cranberry wrap - it 'll remind you of thanksgiving at any time of the year . it hasn 't been super busy any of the times i 've visited -- yet . that will be sure to change as word spreads about this hidden gem . nice job by the staff too !
american	i used to work right around the corner and this is where we always took our clients and had our company lunches . the salads , sandwiches and soups are great . everything on the menu is homemade and delicious . my favorite items on the menu are the roast beef avocado melt , pecan honey dijon salad , cream of spinach and artichoke soup , chicken tortilla soup . if you 're in the area , drop in .
american	i had the chop and chick ( pork chop and eggs ) with home fries . it was a solid breakfast . it is a relatively small place , i did not have to wait for a counter seat ( eating alone ) but there was a wait for a table . the food is worth the wait . you can tell it is all homemade and freshly prepared . the servers and staff are very friendly and attentive . even with my back to the dining room , eating at the counter looking out the window , they were refilling my coffee mug before it was empty .
american	the food is all amazing my only wish was that they had a eggs benedict . fresh squeezed oj and not over priced . small restaurant expect to wait during peak hours .
american	we had the eggs benedict , grains , fruit and nuts oatmeal , the lumberjack ( huge ) and classic french toast . all the meals were hot and fresh , tasted amazing and larger portion sizes . prices were very reasonable and we are all happy ! i will be back as often as we can ! the wait is worth it !
american	i have enjoyed their breakfast several times , but yesterday i tried their blt on the patio ( which i ordered with " extra bacon " ) fantastic ! they also have above average iced tea .
american	been a few times , lots of options . homefries were on point , crispy .
american	loved the french toasts that we tried and look forward to trying other items on the menu . we live in the far west valley and would definitely drive over here again . service was amazing as well .
american	our waitress was very pleasant and provided quick and friendly service . the food was also very good . we sat outside on the patio under the cool mist and had an enjoyable time . will be going back .
american	the service was prompt and food was very good . the french toast was a particular favorite with the kids .
american	today 's service was spot on . i love their coffee and their b. mary 's . banana bread french toast alone is a five star ! perfect location in old town scottsdale and a " favorite breakfast spot " 5 star review .
american	the decor is spot on , and the patio is a nice size . they 've got a ton of beer on tap , and a pretty impressive menu for the size of the place . i 've been through twice now , and sat at the bar both times . bar service was quick and friendly , and prices were pretty good . sunday brunch menu is limited , but very good - the waffle with blueberry syrup was delicious , and the western breakfast pizza was clever , and great to share . i also tried the pretzel pepperoni pizza off of the regular menu , which was a great one to share , too .
american	a bright sunny morning . a lazy , slept-in start to the day . a great restaurant with good coffee , relaxed atmosphere and friendly service staff to ease you into your day . we arrived at harbord early , 10 : 30 , no wait . straight to the back patio , sun rays peeking through the overhang trees . quaint , secluded trellis walls . oj was expensive and small . coffee was brewed well . the burger , ( perhaps the best in to ) , was drippingly delicious . just inspiring . the eggs benny served on a crossiant was also delicious . just a great brunch , best in awhile . too bad the weather is getting colder .
american	the ambiance of the restaraunt , from the decor of the place to the cutlery and plates used is very hip , rustic and so " aesthetic " ( definitely an instagram worthy place ) the service and food was good , not amazing , but good enough for me to want to go back and recommend it to others i ordered the shakshouka ( poached egg in a spiced peppery tomatoe sauce served with bread ) and it was delicious ! the two slabs of cheese was a nice unexpected touch to the dish . however i wish they had crumbled it over the top instead of serving it as two slices ( just a preference )
american	came for sunday brunch at 11 : 30 , only about 10 minutes until we had a prime spot on the patio ( there was space inside ) . great service in both official languages despite a mostly packed house , and our food arrived in less than 15 minutes . the food was great - not much to say , it 's a delicious and reasonably priced brunch . waitress came by multiple times to refill water , coffee , etc . the other reviews , if you read them , seem to be written by difficult people who did everything to ask for bad service . les folies is a great spot , ignore the others - you won 't be disappointed .
american	i was skeptical of any restaurant in the old port area because it 's just overrun with tourists ( myself included ) , but i was quite impressed by my meal here ... the highlight of which was a slice of thick grain bread , toasted and served with an apple puree spread and topped with blueberries . it was just a part of the crepe dish , but blew away the main course altogether . this will be my brunch spot for future montreal visits .
american	great breakfast selection with plenty of different types of items . the coffee is also delicious . we 've been here for dinner and happy hour as well , also very good .
american	popular with locals -- it has a great patio and yummy banana bread . highly recommend the chile rellenos breakfast casserole . would have given it 5 stars except the coffee was weak .
american	i just made the mistake of not pacing my self and well , now i am paying for it . i had the brunch and it was great . big selection and tasty dishes . my wife loved the dessert bar and the macaroni and cheese . if you get a chance to eat there i highly recommend it just plan on staying close to a toilet afterwards .
american	our server explained the " bottomless " wine or beer that is only $ 17 per person . we had great rib rye , prime rib and crab legs . a huge pot of paella and a great sushi and seafood selection . they have asain , latin , pho , italian , seafood , salad , and soup atatipn , and then carving station . the carving was chickens 3 kinds , rib eye , roast beef and prime rib . the experience was great and i can 't understand the complaints about price . this is a classy buffet with top notch good foods ! sounds like people don 't understand the difference between this and souplantation .
american	i typically only ride my bike to / from work . my bike is simply a towny . my questions were basic , yet they made me feel valid . i got a sandwich while i was there . excellent . not sure where they got their bread , but it was delicious . fresh meat and a potato salad recipe like none other i have had . you can 't find a meal deal like this under 10.00 in many sandwich shops in town .
american	line was out the door when we arrived they were quick to get order and get food out ! only down fall is burgers are a little small but still really yummy and would totally go back ! !
american	it definitely is top 5 for burgers in the city . great selection of burgers . the only thing i don 't like is that the burgers are pretty small other than that they 're great .
american	a great burger made fresh in front of your eyes not that frozen fast food stuff they actually cook a piece of meat on a grill ... you can choose your own toppings and there 's free peanuts ... the price is a bit expensive but its worth the price just for the burgers
american	fresh meat . great toppings . and it is absolutely the only place to eat truffle fries . ever . i go pretty often and it is consistently great food the meat is fresh , the buns are pretty good for soaking up the juice and they can actually cook a burger to medium . properly .
american	it could use some more consistency with the temperature and size of the fries though . i am not a fan of the new coke machines because they get really crowded when the place is busy .
american	it think it is infinitely better than red robin . they have a great variety of burgers all with fresh ingredients . my personal favorite is the arizona burger . fresh guacamole and jalapenos ! yup ! their milkshakes are also amazing ! the best is oreo or salted caramel ! give it a try ! i don 't think you will be disappointed !
american	we opted for the priest burger as it has the cheese stuffed portabello mushroom cap on top of the burger . fries were decent and it was quick . highly recommended over other burger places that have popped up nearby .
american	sizes are the right size to actually have a business meeting / discussion . so in other words , get an appetizer if you are hungry hungry . service is impeccable and they go out of their way to provide a personal experience . debated giving 5 stars but on a couple of occasions they have been back logged in the kitchen .
american	they have a huge selection of sandwich fillings and homemade meals such as mac cheese , lasagne , chilli to sit in or takeaway . highly recommend cafe with excellent food and really good friendly service .
american	the place has a real community-integrated vibe and bobby is super friendly . we are delighted to make this our neighborhood go-to and have quickly become regulars .
american	good service and pleasant open surroundings even if you eat inside . i 'm a chili connoisseur so i had the " big chili " and was not disappointed . seasoning was perfect and the chunks of filet were very tender and tasty . chopped cob salad was also very fresh and tasty but bring a big appetite to get through it .
american	the cheese grits are my favorite in town and the bacon is thick and delicious . good coffee and the scones are made every morning . the ambiance leaves for something to be desired , but is appropriate for the type of food served .
american	great for a business lunch or even a brunch on the weekend . it 's a place i keep coming back to every now and then . definitely recommended if you are downtown .
american	a diverse menu , always with a veggie / vegan option , fish and a game dish ( venison / rabbit / bison , etc ) as well as more typical fare . i 've been going here since the early ' 90s . it remains my favourite single restaurent in montréal , because the menu never gets stale , and the ambiance is friendly and casual .
american	we ordered the biscuits to start and they were warm buttery and flaky perfection . the drinks were unique takes on traditional southern cocktails . i ordered the wedge salad- it was crispy and topped with a delicious buttermilk dressing . i asked to add a protein to the salad and they accommodated by adding some fried chicken i requested . my friend ordered the shortrib and it is literally fell apart once she cut in to it with her fork ... soooo tender and delicious ! we went right before close and we did not feel rushed , service was great overall . i would go back again !
american	a great change from the pricey resort restaurants , good food , great prices and if your there in the evening hopefully you get donna as your waitress very attentive , fun attitude and nice as can be .
american	i recommend eating here. its like an old time country diner .
american	nice atmosphere and very friendly employees . i had the curry chicken wrap and really enjoyed it . also the sweet potato fries are great too . i am looking forward to going again and highly recommend if you are in the downtown area . i have to go back to try the smoothies next .
american	my children absolutely loved the train table and the children 's menu . the food was delicious and the service was great . our family will definitely be dinning there again .
american	if you enjoy breakfast , you will have a hard time deciding what to pick from over 6 pages of breakfast items , including the classic ( eggs benedict , country fried steak ) , to the interesting ( oreo pancakes , fried chicken and waffles ) . we had the chicken fried steak , which was excellent , and the banana pancakes , which are some of the best i 've ever had . the portions are huge , the coffee is perfect , the prices are low and the service is good . the parking is easy , and it 's only about 2 miles away from the strip .
american	greatest selection of beers around . the sampler had 6 choices and they were all good . mac & cheese was outstanding . typical bar and grill food . very good selection of salads and entrees .
american	the other day i got a prosciutto panini with mozzarella and spinach and some spread . i added 2 salads - the spinach walnut and strawberry , and the corn and black bean salad . everything tasted amazing . all of that was about $ 10 . not too shabby . the place is a bit small and i feel a bit rushed to make a decision when i come during the week . it 's to be expected downtown i guess . in the summer they have a lot of outside seating to people watch while you enjoy your lunch in the sun .
american	they slice the meat and cheese to order and the result is a really fresh sandwich . really like that they offer a 5 " size , it is perfect for lunch . also , the mayo / mustard mix is really tasty .
american	my boyfriend and i go here all the time and always have great , fast service and food ! i love their pastas and appetizers and my boyfriend loves their steaks ! so far never had a bad experience at this location . the food prices are fair and decent portioned , clean restrooms is a plus ! when coming on the weekends though , make sure to come 30 minutes-1 hour earlier than when you normally eat because this place is hopping with people and the wait can be taxing to those who are impatient . try the avocado spring rolls ! ( make sure to ask for two sauces not one , it 's super delicious ! )
american	good portions . no classy decor .... but then again , i didn 't go there expecting that . the only downside is that it 's a cash only business . hit the bank machine before you go or take advantage of the atm they have on-site . i forgot to take a picture of my delicious banquet burger before it met it 's demise !
american	i also like to plug-in to work here every once in a while . the place just has a great feel to it .
american	locally owned . love the design , atmosphere and the coffee . would get at least 4 stars even in a major city . not much room for me to expand . if you want a cool place to chill in the area , this is your spot .
american	with a great selection of food and drinks ( including alcohol and alcoholic coffee drinks ) , it 's too good to pass up . i do have to ding them slightly , though , for being a tad on the dark side , plus the seating isn 't super-comfy . but depending on your mood or style , you might well prefer kopi over the other also-great alternatives on the same block .
american	it 's not fancy , but you 'll have a great time .... and the spicy mac & cheese prevents most hangovers !
american	the service was superb and the food was great . first course , table side caesar salad . raw egg , anchovies , salt and pepper , lemon juice , mustard , i can go on and on , but amazing . fresh , decadent , flavorful and perfectly balanced . the lamb shank was so juicy and perfectly cooked . expertly seasoned . the potatoes were a great compliment . i loved my filet . again , perfectly cooked mid rare and seasoned to perfection . i 've been here four times , for a nice meal or before catching a show . consistently the best in las vegas !
american	, . we decided to get six burgers with the first three being one of every " preset " combination ( california , caliente , cowboy ) and three regular burgers with three different patties ( merguez , dry aged beef & salmon ) my favorite was the caliente just cause of the heat of it and the best " meat " imo would either be the salmon or the dry aged . the fries are good and their house sauce compliments anything with so many options that you can create ... just like with the " create your own " concepts i fuck with this
american	i went out on a limb with the granny smith apple / caramel burger with a chicken breast instead of a burger . it was great ! definitely a big portion : i could barely finish 1 / 3 of it . i got the onion straws on the side , but i wouldn 't get them in the future . kind of dry- you 're better off sticking with fries . not to mention the service was great . our waitress was very patient explaining different dishes and drinks , and kindly waiting while i took way too long to decide . we 'll definitely be going back to try some other their other great grub and beers .
american	a great date place .... romantic , warm , lovely ..... this is the place where my hubby and i ended up " meeting .... " the food was really good , although there was nothing that was very memorable that meant that we 'd * have * to go back ... but it is a lovely ambiance for a romantic dinner .
american	the menu was a little pricey but the quality of the food made it worth it . i had the lamb which is the chef 's special . normally i 'm somewhat indifferent about lamb but the way this was prepared made it something i 'd get again and certainly recommend . overall , i definitely recommend eleven . i 'll be back .
american	romantic lighting and seating , great cocktails and not a hint of pretense despite the oh-so-cleverly named cocktails .
american	as well as smoked bbq wings & fries ! great atmosphere !
american	my favorite is probably the class italian sub , but i know lots of people who swear by the cheese-steak. if you dine in , you get a plate of fries with your sandwich ( plus a mint hidden at the bottom of your fries , suprise ! ) . i love the atmosphere too , as the restaurant is covered with pictures of old pittsburgh .
american	i was in cleveland for business for the first time , and i was looking for a quick place to grab dinner within quick walking distance of my hotel . i found this place right across the street . it was a quick and chilly walk over . the assistant manager greeted me upon entering and gave me recommendations . i chose the corned beef reuben . the sandwich was amazing along with my dark roast coffee . the chef even came out to inquire if i was pleased with my food . overall , i love this place , and i will be returning if i 'm ever back in the city .
american	they made it fun with smiles and great food , gave the feel of the diners in ny were people welcomed you as a regular .
american	love their menu , not your typical eggs and sandwiches . they all have their own take on everyday foods .
american	had the corned beef hash today and everything about it was just right . the hash was flavourful , well-balanced and just generally tasty , the egg was cooked just right , the toast wasn 't too dry , and the hash browns were made from real potatoes . the food is nothing fancy , but everything they do they do just right .
american	a great diner in chandler. incredible service , great food and good sized portions. the service and atmosphere are worth making this a stop when you are hungry .
american	it is what it is . a small diner with sassy ladies working there . take it for the gem it is ! food is diner style and good at being that . although i 've never tried desserts look amazing !
american	the food is cheap and tasty . i got the pinky dog which was overflowing with chili and pimento cheese . the sweet potato chips were also very good . it 's hard to go wrong with an order here . the burgers , hotdogs , and tacos are all good . i 've never been there with someone that didn 't like what they ordered .
american	there are lots and lots of choices here , and everything i 've had is great . this isn 't a fancy place , service is generally good , but food is always good . breakfast and lunch is best but i have had some good dinners here also . they have breakfast all day so anytime you are in a breakfast mood , this is a good choice . this is also a good place for group , because their menu is so wide , everyone can find something they like .
american	the staff is friendly , and the coffee is good . i always get the eggs and bacon , and it 's always tasty .
american	we enjoyed delicious steak dinners , expertly prepared , two sides --the spinach and the lobster mac & cheese which were delicious , huge shrimp cocktail and a simple yet delicious dessert - the flatbread with chocolate and strawberries . the entire meal was outstanding . the waitress , niki , was friendly , professional and very helpful . i would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a relaxing , delicious dinner in las vegas .
american	our waiter neil was great and made some wonderful recommendations . i had the bone-in ribeye which was tender and flavorful . my girlfriend had the lobster and filet and was a perfect size . we shared one app , one salad and one side . all in all , really enjoyed our meal .
american	the cuisine is a hybrid of american & italian , but oh so good !
american	the mediterranean baked shrimp was delicious - loved the olives and artichoke hearts with the shrimp ! ! my husband was pleased with his crab stuffed flounder . we 'll be back ! !
american	my waitress even helped me open my crab legs for me . the food was hot and plentiful . as stated , the service was excellent-by everyone . all the people working there were very friendly even though the place was very busy . everyone seemed on the same page from the people who first greet you to the people cleaning up your table when you finish . we left full & content . a place we look forward to taking our friends to .
american	we ordered the chinese chicken salad , fresh crisp and not overdressed . shrimp scampi without the arugula , recommended by the server , delicious . a couple of cold stella artois , refreshing ! and topped it off with a creamy ny style cheesecake ... a must visit restaurant at boca park .
american	beautiful ambiance , elegant but not stuffy . service was great ; friendly helpful and efficient . superbly executed bistro food . duck confit- best i have had . roast chicken- perfectly cooked with garnish that really pulled the flavors together . scallops- best scallop dish i have had . great place for a date
american	they couldn 't make me a manhattan because they didn 't have any vermouth , that confirmed their dive bar status for me . 5stars .
american	staff is super friendly and food is awesome ! one of our top 3 places for mimosas and lunch ! great place for small and large dogs as it is a nice , large space .
american	it 's an iconic vegas restaurant , located off of the beaten path . the tables and chairs reminded me of childhood , the old wooden spindle style . the grill that they make the steaks on is right out in the open so you can watch . the steak comes with a nice smoky charred flavor . i tried the scallops in cream sauce , and it was very good . the scallops were fresh and cooked properly , not chewy at all . they were very busy , but the waitress was very attentive . the prices were very reasonable for a steak house .
american	old vegas charm . top notch service . i had the sole with capers . mmm licious ! hubby had the fish of the day prepared with a kick ! a short walk from fremot experience .
american	i wanted to visit again this trip but alas , that is no longer an option due to unfortunate timing.mgreat food , nice atmosphere and one of the spots run by the underground food guys and gals . you won 't get a trough of slop , so go elsewhere if that 's your expectation , this was a restaurant of creativity and seasonal variation .
american	called a week before for a reservation for a special event . no problems . called the day of the move the time . no problems . got there and the table was reserved in a marvelous part of the restaurant . great greeter . service was terrific . food was sensational . unlike many restaurants where they rush you , no such thing at dc . a wonderful evening . will come back again ... soon . many thanks for a great experience .
american	very knowledgeable and friendly staff , wonderful food , amazing atmosphere . this is a go-to place when a special event comes up , or if i want to celebrate with friends . not the best for families with small children .
american	the service is always friendly . the place is always busy and lively without being so packed . there is usually a 5-10 minute wait at lunch , but nothing extreme . the food is great . some of the best pub food i 've had . their sandwiches are excellent and served on fresh bread . the fries are fresh and not frozen . i 've been pleased with everything i 've ordered . perfect liberty village lunch .
american	had to wait for a little over an hour to be seated , but we were there on a saturday during dinner , so it was kind of expected . and there was certainly plenty of entertainment around . the staff was friendly and attentive , the beer selection was wonderful . we had two delicious appetizers between five of us . when our food arrived , it was spectacular . we got three orders of fries between us , but the highlight of bunch were the truffle parmesan fries . so frakkin good . my burger was cooked a perfect medium-rare and was amazing . definitely recommend the farm burger . i found the prices reasonable and will for surely return in the future .
american	my concern is just because its far away from tempe
american	burgers were awesome , fresh cut fries were amazing . all outdoors but was a beautiful day ! the waitress ( sammy ) was so friendly ! ! we will definitely be back !
american	celebrated our 23rd wedding anniversary last night it was great . delicious food . excellent service . friendly staff . the fact that it was half price wine night was an added bonus . considering it 's a 2 hour dr. from our home in tucson , we will still be back again .
american	i 've had the chance to try it on several occasions and from a relaxed lunch outside on the terrasse to the comfy feeling of a winter diner and jazz music during winter , this place always delivers . food is upscale without the price , great service without the stuffiness . a definite recommendation if you are in the neighborhood .
american	where else can you slide into the dining room ? we always have large groups and they are very accomodating , every table we 've been at affords a beautiful view at sunset . they try to make it a complete experience . servers are always very helpful and attentive . steaks are good and the sides are good if not very inventive . the birthday dessert and cotton candy really cap off the dinners .
american	start with the seafood sampler or the pan fried foie gras . awesome . then we all went with rib eyes or other steaks . perfect ! with bleu cheese or oscar style . i had the foie gras topping . wow ! get sides to share ! lobster mac , poutine , brussel sprouts ... yum . the atmosphere is classy but warm and friendly . 1940s style . you just can 't beat it .
american	almost no wait to be seated and the service was incredible . the chipotle-avocado burger was one of the best i 've had and the grey goose martini i ordered was spot on .
american	excellent customer service , fantastic food , great wine and exceptional company ! highly recommend mastro 's . biggest highlight was the rack of lamb , extraordinary !
american	great service started with the very polite hostess who greeted us by name ! the food and atmosphere / ambiance was superb . food not only tasted great but it 's presentation was very creative . not sure what else i can say but i will be back .... very soon !
american	my expectations have been exceeded . expected a touristy experience with low expectations for the food . all five of us were very pleased . steak was my plan but based on the waiters i had the pork chop . truly the best i have ever had . the brussel sprouts were amazing and the view doesn 't get any better . highly recommended
american	our waiter , kevin , was so friendly , knowledgable , and attentive . our food came out well prepared and delicious . this is an absolute beautiful restaurant . cuyahoga falls is lucky to have burntwood .
american	they get busy so go a little early . free coffee refills . the pancakes and waffles were a big hit . i loved the skinny platter- the scramble was awesome . i recommend ordering a side with it though if you have a big appetite . yummy food , give yourself about an hour altogether though .
american	extremely friendly and attentive service . great food as always . angry crab never disappoints .
american	the food was very fresh and menu appear limited to what was fresh for the day . cocktails and wine selections were delicious . the appetizer and entree menu has a limited 5-6 selections . we had the duck and venison which were cooked perfectly . soft shell crab and beef carpaccio were a great appetizer . service was friendly and attentive . would definitely come again and recommend to my friends that want to try food that is unique . desserts were on point . a great food experience overall !
american	breakfast , lunch , and dinner have always been top notch . there is ample shade from mature trees to sit outside at the picnic benches . now that i live closer it will be on the regular rotation !
american	up nice and early with the prego girlfriend and lil bro for nice tasty breakfast . prego had the big breakfast with all sausages ( 5 ) . lil bro had the cheeseburger and i had the eggs florentine . the prego said " yummy " and lil bro said it was great . i myself found quite satisfying and with this price i will be coming back .
american	service is always friendly and attentive.food is always great ... a terrific neighborhood restaurant you 'll want to go to often.like cheers , everyone seems to know each other
american	good atmosphere and good service . we visited for breakfast and it was great . the server paid great attention to detail . will be back for sure !
american	my children love coming here to visit " the joke lady " who always entertains them with a new joke every time we come in . it has become a bit of a tradition . there are some trendier breakfast places around with more of a menu selection , including healthier options but , nothing beats a family owned business that 's been around forever . favorites on the menus are the am bagel , skillet breakfast or the marx brothers .
american	fresh is best and that 's what 's served . no canned food here . our server , amanda was very pleasant and helpful with menu choices . our host was very accommodating when we wanted to change our seats . next time you 're in tempe , az and looking for some good old fashion comfort food , come to the black bear diner .
american	it 's no surprise that the chef started at the pickle barrel - the menu is mostly standards done well . the prices are fine , and service is good . note ; it does get insanely busy on weekends , so reserve or be prepared to wait , but it 's still a great place to do brunch or lunch . it tends to be noisy when full .
american	not much gourmet in a great diner like this , but there is clearly a personal touch . an eclectic , blended community crowd of local , hard-working folk gather who are obvious , regular customers . eat here for the value in simple , homemade food , attentive service , and friendly smiles by the staff . i 'll be back .
american	my favorite thing to eat is the chicken shawarma fire fighter style ( spicy ) , it is amazing . my husband and i go there all the time , the staff is friendly and and the home made tzatziki is the best i 've ever had . i would definitely try this place , you won 't regret it .
american	perfect to celebrate any type of occasion . i would definitely recommend to get their grilled chicken or their veal scallopini . their caesar salad is to die for with their yummy croutons . the service is really friendly and it has a really nice atmosphere . the only thing i was disappointed with was their cocktails . not really a fan . but , all in all , i 've been here a dozen times and will definately go back !
american	the food was excellent and had great prices . the chicken gyro was delicious as well as the choices of hummus .....
american	the parking lot almost needs to be expanded as there are always tons of vehicles every night . food was good - i had a grouper sandwich and it was the freshest i 've ever had . the restraunt was busy and the server did a good job taking care of the table . i 'd go back again and again .
american	friendly service , outstanding breakfast , very reasonably priced .
american	i had the chicken piccata and it was perfect ! service was fast and pleasant .
american	have been going here for sunday breakfasts with my family for years . the service is warm and friendly . have never had a single complaint about the food . everything is always very tasty from pancakes to the traditional egg / bacon breakfasts .
american	friendly staff , quick service , and you can always count on the meals being fresh and super tasty . a side of onion rings and their iced tea go well with any of their fish and chips !
american	of course not as good as in n out but it will do . way better than the mgm and nyny food court options . ( nathan 's , i ; m talking to you , a mediocre $ 12 chicken sandwich is robbery .... )
american	a relaxed ambiance , great meat dishes , at a fair price . a restaurant where tartare and pulled pork are not at the forefront of the menu , refreshing .
american	i 'll definitely stop through again . delicious crepes . even when another group destroyed their banana reserve and we had to do the strawberries instead . ( we got a side of the ricotta and jam to soften the blow . that ricotta is awesome ! ) breakfast burrito was generous , with a nice balance of the fillings ( pico , potatoes , etc . ) and the breakfast sandwich , while not as big , was yummy and quickly devoured . we really enjoyed speaking with the baristas - welcoming was using by another yelper and i 've got to agree . not all of the available art was to my taste but i love seeing walls with original pieces .
american	beer and food are excellent but what makes it different is the staff : motivated , knowledgeable and friendly . we 'll definitely be back with friends and family
american	a very unique " hipster " locale , with a prohibition themed menu but with a severe twist . for example , the steak tartare is a very old school traditional , yet theirs has thai red peppers & and a seaweed based accent . while it was good , it i was a bit unexpected . high marks to the brussel sprouts , smoked pork shop and the old fashioned . we would certainly come back in the future .
american	famous for their sliders and hotdogs . a few favorites of mine are the frito pie . basically a bag of fritos opened up with chili , cheese , and onions poured on top . their banana milk shake is devine . the fish sandwich is pretty good too . its nothing fancy just plain old delicious fattening chicago style food . the owner is always there and is one of the coolest guys around . the place is decked out in chicago sports posters , pictures , banners , etc . anytime i can support a cool local restranteur and get good food everytime i am down for it .
american	our waitress joe was great , and we received free donuts on our way out !
american	opened since 2001 the chef creates amazing and details dishes . being from the west coast it 's hard to find sea bass . one of the best dishes i 've ever had . crispy on the outside and buttery inside . took yelp up on the free desert and ordered the homemade vanilla creme brûlée . if you are west of cleveland you must trek out to avon to experience this place . i travel all over the country and this was one of the top ten meals i 've ever had . that 's right . avon ohio .
american	wish they had one in my home town - burlington , vt !
american	the food here was surprisingly well done and not too expensive either . the scrambles , omelettes and sandwiches were all tasty , but the star was the corned beef hash . very flavorful without being overly salty and topped with fluffy scrambled eggs , it totally hit the spot in the wee hours of the am .
american	my sister and i have been looking around charlotte for a place to get good cocktails ( the perfect old fashioned to be specific ) and some appetizers / tapas to munch on . i 'm not usually a foodie , but our bartender 's ( phil ) recommendations were addictive and my sister and i each had more cocktails than we planned on they were just too good ! we have made nan and byron 's a regular spot thanks to this experience . recommendations : cadillac jalapeno margarita , refashioned , porcini mushroom ravioli , sushi grade tuna tartare
american	i had the power pancake which was huge and filling and definitely worth trying as stated on the menu . a side of bacon with that proved to be filling enough to get me through the day . hubby went with his standard omelet , of cheese . nothing too thrilling but he did say the hash browns were under seasoned which is a big no no in both of our books . seems like a family place and overall a good experience .
american	looks like a dive compared to the glitz but don 't pass it by . had the chicken fried steak and eggs yesterday for breakfast and had to come back ! the chicken fry wasn 't the traditional chicken fry like i know from texas . it 's a huge pork strip , battered and deep fried . perfectly seasoned , tender and delicious with two eggs , potatoes o 'brien and choice of toast . a fantastic deal for $ 8.99 ! ! if you find yourself on the south vegas strip , wander a few blocks east . i doubt you 'll be disappointed .
american	i had the mexican burger which really hit the spot ... onions , green chilies , and two cheeses . the fries were quite good , too . the inside is decorated like a 50 's burger joint .
american	it is out of the slot-machine ugliness that characterizes las vegas . the food is creative and tasty- a real foodie place without the high prices . nice staff and servers who are authentically friendly . the atmosphere is bright and airy in a warehouse setting .
american	the food was to die for . we did the papusa and it was a winner . we did the beet salad , the arugula salad and the chopped salad , all were wonderful . presentation was perfect , service was over the top and the building itself was very nice . it 's an old house that was very comfortably done with two nice patios . i 'll be back !
american	we were greeted by a very friendly hostess and seated immediately . it 's a loyal local 's restaurant . our waitress patti was better than super . was most helpful in assisting with our order . she was friendly and very efficient but still made us feel as friends . the dinner salad was typical but was very very fresh . husband and i both had different chicken dishes-- very tasty . we stuffed ourselves with a delicious cake dessert which was wonderful . patti told us they have a band on friday and saturday nights . it was nice to have a nice quiet uninterrupted dinner . put this on your must to try .
american	very nice atmosphere . modern , oriental feel . the staff was so accommodating , so helpful . the menu was very unique . i had the sablefish . it was the most light , fluffy fish that i have ever had . the sauce , veggies and light , thin fries were all great . the lobster and gnocchi appetizer was amazing . stephen was our waiter . such great service . great find .
american	not your traditional burger and the flavors was spot on , not overpowering and not just adding random toppings . so simply saying they know what they are doing . spent $ 21 on burger , fries and my standard arnold palmer ... i will be back next trip to vegas , jealous of the locals that get to eat here regularly .
american	quaint , friendly , yummy , and inexpensive ! service was good , as were the mimosas . my mom and i shared a cali omelette and a waffle with fruit . all was good . the men enjoyed the house special chili verde omelette . if they had turkey bacon on the menu , i might even call them ... the perfect breakfast spot .
american	the burgers and fries were top notch , and my son had the signature brûlée burger that really is unique with an egg on top and carmelized sugar toasted into the bun . finished off a fine meal with the lucky charm shake , which was max sweetness . highly recommend !
american	portions are huge and very creative . i had the white chapel and it was enough for two . the sausage roll was delicious and more of an english sausage than an american . seating is a bit limited but tables turn quickly . if your a fan of food trucks you 'll love this place . all the taste of a gourmet truck without the uncertainty and eating in the wild .
american	a full bar compliments some of the most amazing bbq ! the platter for two easily feeds three . great prices and a knowledgeable friendly staff . the ribs were perfectly smoked and the brusell sprouts were to die for . a must try !
american	huge inside , and unlike the rest of the block , it 's very modern and clean . the food ? it 's perfect , as only five guys always is .
american	love the pulled pork sammie . also highly recommend the barbicone , a unique and tasty experience. having a waffle cone with bbq is amazing . one of the better food trucks in the city .
american	our first visit will definitely not be our last . i ordered the fontina burger and my wife ordered the bbq chicken pizza . both were absolutely delish ! we also shared a small ceaser salad . everything was fresh and tasty . i can 't wait to return to try the other items on the menu . maybe next time it will be something from the smoker !
american	i have been here for lunch too . both were great ! a cute quaint place . i loved the decor the food and the service . the breakfast menu has some unique items which makes me want to try something new every time . a good balance of healthy and hearty options ! i would recommend this place !
american	i 've actually never been here for dinner but from what i saw on the menu it looked great . prices are a little expensive but definitely worth it . so i 'm still going to give 5 stars . my absolute favorite salad at the moment is their original chopped salad . it 's everything in life to me . i cannot get enough of it . great drink selection and have 200 different whiskeys to choose from . great to go on a sunday as they have all day happy hour . must haves are for sure the original chopped salad , wings , and the wagyu burger . i wish they were open later on weeknights !
american	the menu is extensive , i 've barely made a dent in it , but some notable dishes are the mac and cheese , grilled cheese , spaghetti , eggs benedict , and any of their pies . the rooftop patio has a nice atmosphere but the menu up there is much more limited .... only worth it if you 're going for drinks and the view .
american	they won 't ever disappoint you with their crunchy fries and fresh fish . the only thing is that the service can be mediocre at time ( like when you 're out on the deck and the waiter forgets you 're there and doesn 't come for 40 mins ... ) but overall the food is great and i 'm looking forward to my next visit .
american	i ordered the craft blue - bleu cheese burgers are one of my favorites , and that one really delivered . i paired it with a poutine , because hey , i 'm an american and gravy and cheese curds on fries ? an unhealthy food we didn 't invent ? while i was less impressed with the poutine than dangerous dan 's ( my only other point of reference ) , they didn 't taste bad by any stretch of the imagination . i envy those who can enjoy this place whenever they want . a little expensive , though , so you probably can 't enjoy it all the time .
american	their hotdog is nice , juicy , and covered with a savory chili . the sweet potato fries pass the crisp test . the clams are the large favorable varriety . it has that local tavern feel with good food to make it feel like home .
american	course , i expected that from the number of " what the hell do you mean you 've never been to paddington 's ? ! " i got on twitter after musing about breakfast ideas around the market . i sad at the bar and had a great conversation with the woman evidently running the place while waiting on my massive sandwich . and i think it all came in under $ 10 . the sandwiches alone are also sold at their stand in the market , which is great if you 're looking for a to go item .
american	my boyfriend and i are huge fans of the charming eastern european waitress who has a sharp wit and a great sense of humor . good place for basic , non-hipster , affordable breakfast .
american	meat melts in your mouth , warm pita , and amazing sauces .
american	the pablo battered shrimp are great ! the smoked prime rib is incredible . would recommend anyone passing through phoenix be sure and stop here !
american	very expensive , prepare to pay . even compared to the other crafts , this one stands out on price . take note , the fries are huge ! a great thing to share with the table . the grits were tasty . the sticky bun dessert was wonderful .
american	the wine selection for happy hour was just " ok . " the service was great , food delicious , atmosphere superb . i will definitely return soon , i ordered grilled glazed scallops and shrimp & grits . no left overs for me ; good food and right portions .
american	for those who are dedicated to healthy living the chopshop has a variety of options . salads are off the hook ! ! ! staff is friendly and have willingness to please . the establishment is small but it only adds to the mystic of the experience .
american	great mediterranean cafe with friendly service and fair price . save your money and get off the strip .
american	our friends introduced us to this place and we loved it ! food is yummy , beer is great , atmosphere and patio seating are awesome ! main downside is the location and parking , but definitely worth the walk if you end up having to park far . i had the hef which was delish and the portabella veggie beer bread which was so fresh and filling . it was so good , but i couldn 't even finish it ! will definitely be back again !
american	great lunch specials , decent prices and good food . i went for the italian wedding soup and 1 / 2 portobello mushroom sandwich , and that was filling . super nice staff . thumbs up from me . will definitely be back .
american	i 've enjoyed various dinner platters and the tzatziki is delicious .
american	i got the loaded sweet potato skins which were pretty good . roasted in half , with crispy sweet edges and topped with bacon , chicken and a good white sauce . it 's not as heavy as i thought it would be and was a healthy alternative to regular loaded potato skins . i also got their pasta bolognese with zucchini noodles . the sauce was good and the noodles were good too ( although i wish they offered a real pasta alternative ) but i thought the poached egg was too undercooked . my server was really friendly and the space was family friendly !
american	a great host with free wine tasting before dinner followed by a delicious meal and more wine with live music in a century old barn .
american	prime steaks ribs , cocktails . the best . jerseys , autographed baseball 's , and posters everywhere . awesome .
american	i tend to support local businesses , so this was a natural fit for us . what a great choice for us . i had the special ( 24z ribeye ) , and my wife had the pulled pork . both items came out perfect and at a reasonable amount of time . now for the service . wow , just wow ! absolutely spot on . needs were anticipated , and very sensitive to a gluten free diet as well . cocktails were perfect too .
american	they have breakfasts of all description , freshly made and quite enormous , at reasonable prices . bring a big appetite . their omelots will fill you to bursting even if you don 't eat the huge slices of bread and hash browns that come with them . and , hey , the coffee is good , too .
american	we sat on the patio and enjoyed our dosas . i had the masla dosa and it was huge . nice and spicy too ! service was attentive and fast . i would definitely go back .
american	wide selection of food , great staff , reasonable prices . wifi and breakfast any time ! ! ! my favorite place ! ! ! bill , scottsdale
american	the shop has a traditional coffee house feel , with a touch of local trinkets , soaps and art . what i appreciated most was the layout . there were booths ! my favorite thing is a booth and it 's so convenient for working with a computer . there are also comfy couches and tucked away chairs as well . they had these fabulous mini pies that were only $ 1 . they were made especially for national pi day which was awesome . i will definitely be back , & thanks again to charlie for the great customer service .
american	good healthy affordable tasty eating , with local beers on tap . hard to top for that . mac & cheese was very solid . we 'll be back .
american	i happen to work nights and have come to this restaurant at all different random hours of the nights ! the pluses are they have funky tables and great food ( i love the banquise burger and the poutines ) the only downside is there are many young drunks there at all hours and the music is often played so loud you cant talk to whomever you are eating with . however , everyone had to try this place once ! prices are cheap and food is great !
american	a hole in the wall mom and pop 's joint . have been eating there since lenny himself would cook the burgers . the fries are amazing and the burgers are to die for . i get the ranch burger with jalapenos and cheese . classic food for a good price , better than chain fast food restaurants . good for low-key dates
american	friendly waitresses , good coffee , milkshakes and root beer floats and terrific comfort food .
american	our family was traveling from chicago and found this spot walking back from cn tower . very friendly and accommodating staff . good was average but pastries were very good . reasonably priced meal for our family . pulled pork and chicken panini were good burger was average . i would recommend especially to get away from the cn tower chaos .
american	don 't be intimidated by the shady exterior . commit and get a good drunk recovery meal !
american	had the red velvet pancakes and the adobo fried rice omelet . both good . the pancakes were over the top . coffee was good , too . only kick on the place was that i couldn 't connect to their wireless with the ipad or iphone . luckily i was able to connect to the casino next door long enough to download a book from amazon . the people were very friendly , too .
american	the menu offers a huge variety of classic breakfast staples , ranging from waffles to crepes to omelettes to benedicts . they all seem to come with a generous helping of fresh fruit , and the prices are quite affordable . tasty food , well prepared . i 'll be back .
american	the service was on point and the staff was helpful and friendly . i will definitely be back to try the banana fosters pancakes and the garlic fried rice when visiting vegas !
american	i had the red velvet ( yum ) with whipped cream and cream cheese icing . a " short stack " was plenty ! ! hubby had french toast with eggs . they have lots of breakfast specialties and hawaiian items as well .
american	i had a blt w / yukon fries , which was excellent . it 's served on a fresh baguette with chipotle mayo and what may be the tastiest bacon i 've ever had in my life . although you have to navigate a series of underground tunnels to sit out back on the patio , it 's quiet and perfect for an afternoon meal . i also love the nearby wifi network called " queen mothership " which has absolutely nothing to do w / the cafe ! exactly what i 'd do if i lived upstairs .
american	located on the northwest side of the chubb insurance building its not visible from the road . caters to office buildings in the area . when you walk in you 're not too impressed with the setting but the owner is cheerful and will quickly know your name and call you " brother " or " my friend " until he does . good quality food at a reasonable price . i get tired of the happy valley road chain restaurants but i can come by here a couple times a week and it never gets old . inside and outdoor seating available . work in the area ? if so , try it out .
american	i like to take my six-year-old daughter there for a smoothie . we hang out reading books .
american	the pale ales are spot on and the wife enjoyed the extra stout . the pretzels are pretty much poetry twisted into luscious goodness with awesome beer cheese dipping sauce . you could tell there was a strong local following and the staff seemed to know most of them . that 's what you look for when passing through . when you find it , you know you found a gem .
american	you can 't go wrong with a place full of locals and this was it . tons of food for the low prices , good coffee to wash it all down . gets a little crowded at times and the tables are close together .
american	this is the 2nd time i have dined here . they have a great outside patio along with their inside dining . everything is made from scratch including the bread . they have 3 different homemade soups and daily specials . the portions are large . i shared the fresh mozzarella and tomato ( add some prosciutto ) sandwich with my mom and i didn 't go away hungry . they have all sorts of desserts from cake to cookies .
american	the service is friendly and quick to offer a suggestion on a delicious drink or special treat . they give you a free dessert on your first visit in and have a great variety of pastries and breakfast nosh to please just about anyone . small but adorable and dog friendly patio is a great place to relax and people watch . this place will quickly become your favorite coffeehouse in phoenix
american	the pulled-pork sandwich is awesome - i will be going back just for that . the place isn 't much to look at from outside , but the owner neville is a cool and friendly guy . the home-made pulled-pork is amazing , and you can get it with a trio ( soup & drink ) for less than $ 10 . did i mention the pulled-pork is really good ?
american	most of the clientele were students and possibly professors from asu ... locals i am sure . great vibe , good coffee and tea for sure . i will come back and visit if i 'm in the neighborhood .
american	a great little italian eatery in crock or park. every time i went there the service was excellent and fast. even ordering a pizza to split with my friend it was fast and an excellent amour of yummy tasty food. great place for a romantic dinner with your partner as well the atmosphere is perfect and the food is to die for
american	the beer is always good , and the food is really delicious . try the poutine ! they offer brunch on sundays , and everything tastes really good . my only mark down is that sometimes service can be a little slow , but otherwise it 's a favorite place of mine that i will definitely recommend to others !
american	we 've made our way through much of the menu , often depending on recommendations from the staff , who have never steered us wrong . love their soups , sandwiches and salads . always happy to head there for breakfast or lunch .
american	a great little neighborhood gem , went for breakfast sunday morning , service was excellent , food was fresh & made to order - i almost hate for word to get out , since great breakfast spots = lines out the door in this town - but not only is this spot worth the yelp , i 'd even wait in line ( if i had to ) .
american	good service and a great cheap breakfast . we will be regulars !
american	loved the chicken medici . the asparagus was perfectly crisp , and the meat very tender . house wine ( chardonnay ) was $ 5.50 and tasty although more expensive options were available . the live music ( friday saturday and sunday ) was a tad too loud for a restaurant for comfortable chatter ... ( 5 stars if the music had been soft and dinner like ) the fu-chookie dessert was yummy and decadent . i will be back ! !
american	comfortable and relaxed with great and friendly staff and a good menu with many options to satisfy any appetite . the food is good and fresh and the prices are quite reasonable .
american	their daily selections of muffins and pastries are fresh and yummy . the owner and staff are very pleasant too ! i come home almost every day to grab a coffee or a quick bite to eat while i 'm at work . i recommend this place for anyone looking for a convenient place to eat with good food and service . all the while supporting a local business .
american	even when i walk past it , it 's classic decor and bar stools make me smile .
american	honest to goodness quality food . small diner , not good for larger groups .
american	i always get the gyros value meal and have them add feta cheese to the gyro ( $ 1 extra ) . the meal comes with great fries and an overloaded pita with kronos branded meet off of their vertical broiler . i 'm pretty sure it 's the lamb / beef original recipe . kronos is something i 've looked for after moving to the scottsdale area and this was the first place i found it . the owner is extremely friendly and willing to strike up a conversation . i 've had nothing but pleasant interactions and experiences at this restaurant .
american	i love their outdoor seating and the there are little rooms inside . i had a turkey panini with chips and it was really good . the sand which was big and i took 1 / 2 home . we were there in the summer , i would love to come back in the fall and enjoy the outside patio .
american	my son and i came to try it from a groupon i bought . i had the chili omelette with the works chili . it was very tasty and the portion was huge . the works potatoes are very good . they have like a cajun seasoning to them . my son got the mouse pancake with chocolate chips . he got the sausage patty . our server christian was awesome . it was hard to decide if the food or the service was better . i definitely recommend and if u can score the groupon even better . next time i 'm in vegas , i will definitely come here .
american	something for everyone - meat eaters and vegan . good prices and delicious food . they really care about incorporating as much local as possible . i 'd choose this place over any restaurant chain . the portion sizes are huge too- there 's always leftovers .
american	the scenary is not much but the variety of soup and salads offered are great . the workers are always very friendly and allowed me to sample all the soups my first time there . i love that they offer a variety of vinaigrettes and even have them to sell by the pint . i go at least once a week for lunch .
american	they had a bunch of happy hour specials going on monday night and since we arrived before 6pm , we were able to benefit . nice . we tried : duck wings bread with brown sugar butter fried brussels sprouts to start . all delicious for dinner i had halibut which was cooked perfectly and nicely sized . for dessert a couple of us shared the chocolate raspberry dish which was like a dark chocolate peanut butter cup with raspberry sorbet which was very yummy . good service and for the quality of the meal the pricing was excellent . i will definitely return .
american	the fried chicken , macaroni and cheese , greens , and yams are very good ! great prices on a burger and fry meal ( about $ 3.50 for a huge burger and fries ! ! ! ) ! the only drawbacks are the wait time for the food , there is sometimes a lack of seasoning ( specifically salt ) in the food , and the appearance of the restaurant . but overall , it is a great place to stop in to get a tasty bite to eat ! thumbs up ! : )
american	my wife and i decided to stop in on a sunday . it was busy but we were seated quickly . i ordered the fish tacos and a side salad with homemade bleu cheese dressing , and my wife had the breakfast burger with the hashbrown caserole off of the brunch menu and both meals were great ! our server was awesome ! we 'll definitely be back !
american	friendly staff , clean and cozy environment , and delicious food . the shrimp and grits were flavorful and a satisfactory serving size , as were the chicken and waffles my husband got . their cocktail menu had some great staples on it , and their bloody mary we tried was very tasty . i 'm definitely interested in going back and trying different food dishes and different cocktails . everything sounded wonderful . the service was great , and they even accommodated a high chair for us . parking is a challenge sometimes , but i think there 's value options on w 25th during certain hours . i 'd also recommend making reservations because the restaurant is rather small .
american	the german influence is apparent in the menu and definitely welcome . the style of the food is completely unpretentious , very satisfying , and a little hint of home-cookedness . i went twice in four nights in montreal . good value , and everything from fish to escargots to duck was cooked absolutely perfectly .
american	they serve the best pork chop in the city . delicious chops , perfectly seasoned with a delicious sauce and cherry peppers . just a hint of spice to go with the flavorful and savory sauce . the mashed potatoes were so creamy and had the perfect texture . gravy was top notch too . our server was friendly and the owner is a great and funny guy . we love going here !
american	very informal with a walk up ordering counter offering very tasty fish and chips and other seafood . in addition to the inside tables an outdoor eating area is available . beer in bottles / cans and limited wine selection available . most selections served with skinny french fries and a creamy coleslaw . food all seemed to be freshly fried to order in a very light breading that did not mask the flavor of the fish was very enjoyable !
american	the dosa was the best i 've had in a long while ; both the flavor and texture were perfect . the accompanying chutneys and sambar were exquisite . the meal made me nostalgic for when i lived in karnataka for a short while , and the owners / staff were really nice . definitely a gem to my taste !
american	good home cookin ' , classic cartoons , friendly service and a great music play list . eat in or take away . breakfast was extremely satisfying - the classic breakfast was classically good . the local sausage was yum , as was the bacon , blood pudding and everything else on my plate . the eggs with smoked salmon was also very good . the best part : a wonderful cup of coffee with warm milk - done perfectly from their espresso machine . service was friendly , but a bit slow . would like to return for lunch . give this place a try , you won 't be disappointed ! ! no frills but fun atmosphere .
american	affordable meals and some fun cocktails on offer , this place is always busy with good reason - their service is fantastic . the few times i got beef burgers here they were a little on the dry side . a little more fat in their mince would soon fix that and keep everything juicy . all in all , a good spot to catch up with friends without breaking the bank .
american	it was a drive becuase i normally go to n. scottsdale places but yelp did not lead me astray . it 's a cross between a coffee shop and a deli . i had the chicken salad and pasta salad and they were both really good !
american	half of it is " skinny " a.k.a. healthy food at the other part is " fats " which they call their happy menu . we got one healthy item and one happy item . i ate most of the happy item ( obviously ) and it was their brie french toast . it was very good ( if you like brie which i certainly do ! ) . overall , i recommend coming here ! it 's out of the way but they over a very good and unique menu .
american	my daughter took me for birthday brunch and even though the menu is not as large as during the week , there were a lot of choices on the menu everything was fresh , tastefully prepared and presented . the service was great ( not sure where everybody 's coming from with complaints of slow or non-existent service , not this day ) . for sure we will be returning there ! !
american	i had heard some good things about this place , and the reviews were right . wife and i shared a dozen and a half oysters with a couple of chilled grey goose shots followed by their jumbo shrimp cocktail , and ended with the seafood risotto and a few glasses of bubbly . the oysters were really fresh , the shrimp were jumbo although i thought 6 shrimp would have been better than the 4 they gave , and the risotto offered some much needed warmth from the 50 degree weather outside . i 'll be back next time we 're here ... could turn into a tradition . a walk down the strip , some oysters , vodka and bubbly only in vegas .
american	part owner ( and fulltime pet ) ivy , it a pug doggie with attitude . she has her owners working the shop with quick smiles and friendly service . the check-off list menu is fun and adds a little twist to the simple hotdog order . the dogs were amazing ... it don 't get better than this ... each bite gave a tantalizing hint of what was to come on a fully loaded dog . a little bit pricy ... but well worth the cash . four barks easy ... eh , make that four stars ! where the mustard ?
american	while small in space the place is big on breakfast . indoor and outdoor seating for this quaint location , you 'll have a great breakfast for low cost . lots of local ' burgh charm . great for parties of 1-4 , you could squeeze 6 in but too tiny for much more than that . do yourself a favor try eggs n 'at !
american	fresh eggs , pancakes & bacon are always worth the stop here . the buttermilk pancakes were tasty and a nicely large size . they also have other fun options instead of breakfast foods , such as cincinnati chili . the restaurant is bright & clean with the service being fast & friendly .
american	love the staff there especially angello who is always smiling . things i love on their menu ... their soups ... any ... yum ! chicken souvlaki on a pita halibut fish and chips turkey sandwich chicken sandwich with cheese ( massive ) and ... their pies are amaaazing as desert ... do check them out !
american	great american fare with plenty of choices and variety for everyone . space is beautiful and service is excellent . try the breakfast pizza to share , it 's terrific
american	i 've only eaten here a couple of times , but the food has always been very good . the service is wonderful and they have good beers on tap . my only recommendation is to make reservations , even if you are coming only for drinks or you could be waiting a while .
american	wait staff very friendly and helpful . the dishes we ordered were delicious , plating and taste . nice selection of beers and wine on tap . the best for last , the homemade keylime pie !
american	coffee , food , beer , and wine ; they got you any time of day . eat on the patio if the weather is nice ; it is enclosed and has a misting system . inside is small with a coffee bar and tables for 2 and 4 people.delicious menu with a daily special that is always outstanding . whoever chooses the music has great taste .
american	we ate in for a late lunch and had a really nice time . service was friendly and efficient , and i especially liked the artichoke pizza . the food seemed very fresh and homemade . they also do take-out .
american	i have never had any service issues . i 've only tried one food item ( the bbq chicken flatbread ) and thought it was good . the main focus is definitely the beer . i always try something new every time i am in and have yet to be let down . though sometimes it 's hard to know exactly what they have , especially in the coolers . but i use their app to know exactly what 's available .
american	the breakfast is yummy ! a lot of different items on the menu , very creative. the service is really friendly and welcoming . and the juice is fresh and tasty . will be coming back again !
american	the big bear is a must for breakfast . and the reuben sandwich is worth the trip ! classic diner attached to a gas station but is separated by a double glass door . unique ambiance with great food prep ! the only critique is the soup portion was pretty small . try it , you 'll like it !
american	we have pkayed the adjacent golf course many times and liked to get lunch here . this time we had dinner and for vegans they have a special menu which is fantastic . i got the vegetarian nosh which is a choice of various vegetables , startches , and sauces . they also have fresh baked bread that you can purchase to start . my two buddies got a reuben and the other a pasta dish . they both loved their meals . definitely worth a try .
american	i appreciate no freezers , house made salad dressing & fresh food . i am so happy to have a local place where i can grab soup & salad for lunch & it 's fresh and chemical / package / junk free .
american	awesome breakfast place ... plus they have a yelp offer if you check in . how awesome is that ? overall great food and great experience . if you go on the weekend ... be prepared for a line !
american	you can also pile on your own toppings yourself and they have a salad bar ( if you 're into that ) . my favorite is the teriyaki chicken sandwich that comes with a slice of pineapple for about $ 6 . i get it on wheat with no cheese and load it up with onions and jalapeños myself ( no extra charge ) . a good local healthy option . the gigantic burgers with multiple patties and cheese are also amazing in moderation . everything is made to order . staff are friendly . cool place with good value .
american	i was a bit puzzled by the music , which was a little louder than it should have been . the food was very good . we both got the prix fix selections , and this turned out to be an excellent choice .
american	my husband and i managed to share a portion as they are large but tasted really well . and the pancakes for our child was delicious and came with tasty berries . all in all , we will come back !
american	prices are great and the food quality is even better ! the burgers are a good size along with the fries that you have to order on the side but do feed two people ! the burgers are really juicy and having the potato chips inside makes it pretty fun to eat as well . great vibe inside the restaurant because it isn 't to loud and blocks out the sounds from the vegas strip . you really want to try them out because the employees were amazing and nice as well .
american	we went there yesterday for the first time . the place looks so cool . somebody had invested time and effort to make it feel hip and modern and at the same time private and relaxing . we were served by steven , who really took care of us . we got two free dishes of delicious bread and cheese . the pizza was great and the kids loved their pasta . we would definitely come here again . one of the best surprises we had on the strip .
american	she loves the biscuits and gravy , while i usually opt for pancakes and eggs . the portions are huge , so bring your appetite ! i 've never really eaten anything but breakfast food here ... seems like more of that kind of place . even in the afternoon . not fancy at all ... just a home-spun kind of country diner , decorated with natural wood and hundreds of teddy bears . they have lots of desserts in their display case , too .
american	free popcorn is a plus must try the salad wedge , w / thousand island and bacon bits great wings $ 5 burgers on thursday nights .
american	patrick was a wonderful server ! good was good , service was great ! ordered a small deep dish and it was delicious . also ordered cheese squares which were good too . patrick 's service was fantastic ! will definitely be back when in vegas ! !
american	server jake was very accomodating , fast and efficient . definitely a place we like to keep coming back to again and again . tha convenient location is great too .
american	what looked like an unassuming converted bar had delicious food ! we had the chicken swarma sandwich and a side of falafel . the sandwich was a wrap and came built with pickles , which we found unusual but they somehow worked with the roti chicken and yogurt sauce . the falafel was the hero-- perfectly crisp and nutty with a great yogurt dipping sauce . a no nonsense place for a good meal-- fast and at reasonable prices .
american	a simple , unpretentious , clean and well presented place , a little off the beaten path but not hard to find . had the gyro salad and the original gyro with fries . large and tasty portions , friendly and helpful staff . for what more can one ask , for a quick and inexpensive lunch ?
american	while waiting for your food , choose a beer from the great selection of local beers . have a seat , grab some silverware , and enjoy your meal . lots of seating available , so this is a great place to bring a group . only drawback is that the foods are a bit pricey , but you get what you pay for with regards to quality .
american	i always get the grilled chicken pita and a cup of soup . the red lentil soup is so fabulous that i taught myself how to make a similar version . i also love their lemon soup . great family owns this . it hops at lunch . healthy and satisfying .
american	beer can chicken : was tender , fall off the bone and well seasoned . grilled salmon : the portion was larger than expected and served with a tasty sauce . the service was friendly and swift .
american	huge vaulted ceilings , nice outdoor seating , and solid food . my personal favorites are the spicy southwest chicken griller ( chicken , cheese , guacamole , and a spicy sauce , grilled panini-style on ciabatta ) and the salads . staff has always been very nice and helpful , including bringing food to the table and grabbing napkins , refills , etc . i would definitely recommend this location .
american	nothing beats the coney dog and chili cheese fries , except adding some rock & rye fargo ! i feel like family when i come here ! the only thing that would make it better is a location in gilbert ! then we will really be family !
american	there was a mixup with our order but they made it right and then some . the food was great too . the bacon jam was interesting and the chicken skins were good . but the best thing on the menu is the fish sandwich . my mother ordered it because i generally don 't like fish sandwiches but it was " the best fish sandwich " my mom has ever had .
american	great quality , great service , great experience well done team terra verde
american	we enjoyed a seat outside while eating our sandwiches . the service was pretty good . definitely a nice place to enjoy lunch while soaking up some sun .
american	a great meal ordered newzealand lamb chops meal came with rack of lamb x 6 chops and vegetables lrg portion serve and chops very tender partner had serllion steak & vegetables cooked beautifully service great price very reasonable would definitely recommend
american	everything was perfectly seasoned and the root to berries cocktail was delicious ! definitely worth a wait .
american	we stopped in " the diner " and had great salads - i had the chicken bbq and my spouse had the ahi tuna . they were great - fresh and flavorful . it was a little hard to focus with the big display unit of desserts staring at us , but we managed . kids had an enormous hot dog and some of the best mac and cheese . comfortable , friendly and reasonably priced .
american	i had the pork collar and it was the most tender piece of meat i have had in recent memory . the sauce was slightly overreduced and a little salty , but almost in a good way if that makes sense . the presentation of the micro greens and puree was awesome ! my wife got the short ribs which were equally impressive , we would both definitely return . docked 1 star due to atmosphere , we were sat in the backroom that didn 't quite match the elegance of the food . we felt like we were in a banquet hall leftover from the 80s . i 'm sure it will be renovated in the future for a complete experience .
american	not cheap but definitely not the worst in the mgm . four of us had some drinks and nice amount of food for $ 300 . have the server mix up a plate of oysters for you , they are to die for . clams are always " ehh " so don 't expect miracles . the meat selection is not terribly vast , but what they did have is just fine . the rib-eye is something truly special .
american	virtually everything sounds good . the zucchini ribbons and seafood fettuccine are both excellent and are my favorites . the service is professional . you might be neglected if you choose to dine in the bar , so i suggest getting a regular table . the drinks are first rate , and the atmosphere is elegant . the clientele is a little stuffy for my tastes . also , if cost is a concern , there are no bargains here .
american	the steak pot pie was delish . so was the mac n cheese . the place was super busy but the service was still great . the only down side- there was no a / c .
american	i always have a hard time deciding because everything sounds so good . love the wild mushroom dish. professional & knowledgeable staff . creative wine flights showcasing hard to find wines from around the world .
american	i love coming here to get a buck burger and watch the hockey game . there is great memorabilia on the walls .
american	of course , great beer selection and one of my fav burgers ! !
american	the service was friendly and quick . has a nice beer selection on tap . the hippie ( portobello ) sandwich and the pulled pork sandwich were both quite good . fries and tots , with seasoning , were excellent ... not at all greasy . the kitchen clearly cares about the food they are serving . will definitely return to try more on this interesting menu .
american	unpretentious . laid back . a place where " everybody knows your name . "
american	their beer is consistently great - especially candy bar milk stout . food and service is good , but i wouldn 't say outstanding , hence the 4 stars . definitely recommend trying it out .
american	late nights or early mornings , using the 2 for 1 coupons make this place a great deal . the waitresses are friendly and can recommend anything off their menu . try the sweet tea . makes you think your down south .
american	a great neighborhood gem in the heart of pape villiage with authentic greek fastfood .
american	open all the time . great coffee and tea . the atmosphere is the best especially the outdoor patio on nice days . great location at the corner of bartlett and murray . staff is very friendly .
american	this is the place to be on a summer night , and usually something fun happening on the ice in the winter . the place is loaded with character ( s ) and is a true wisconsin tavern on the lake .
american	and while it 's a terrific little bar , the food is better than you 'd imagine , with fresh ingredients and a nice menu . service is always spot-on . huge patio , heated in winter and air-conditioned in summer . they 're friendlier than other spots , because they 're local and one location .
american	they offer a little bit of everything for everyone--no matter where you fall on the great nc sauce debate ( red or vinegar ) or sc mustard-style . the pulled pork and the pork ribs are my favorites here . there are good beer options . standout sides are hushpuppies and mac and cheese . the slaw is only ok , but to me , slaw is essential for barbecue . this is why i wish the small plates came with two sides . the sweet pickled onions are a nice touch . there is a reason it sometimes gets crowded .
american	we recently moved to the area and tried chizona pizza on a whim . we were completely surprised by the quality and flavor of the food coming out of this little restaurant . we have since ordered several pizzas for delivery and they are not soggy or cold . i 'd highly recommend chizona pizza for your next pizza delivery .
american	had dinner there with a friend whose wife was in the hospital . my wife had a grilled chicken sandwich , our friend a patty melt and i had a cheeseburger with bacon . all were great as was our service . ryan , one of the owners , visited with us and welcomed us to the grill . everything was excellent . you who live close are lucky to have this great neighborhood place . when we are in the area we definitely will return .
american	and .... everything on the menu is truly excellent . the roasted chicken is cracking and their specials will seduce you . start with the onion soup , share an order of mussels--- i like the green curry sauce but the wine broth is a good classic choice too . on weekends prepare to wait as no reservations are taken--- the service is good , the people are friendly--it 's a place---as the jingle goes " where everybody knows your name . "
american	known for its chicken fried steak , the portions are enormous . the mashed potatoes and gravy are amazing , great comfort food . i have yet to have a bad meal there .
american	food and wine at their best . friendly servers and great outdoor seating .
american	we stopped in for a happy hour drink and decided to try some of the apps . the bartender made some great recommendations for us , and we weren 't let down . would also like to mention that dave , the bartender was very accommodating ! he surprised me with a cocktail that he overheard me talking about to my husband . it was a great surprise and definitely made a good impression on us . we 'll def be going back for an actual lunch or dinner : )
american	love their build-your-own burger ( no up-charge for toppings ) . love coming here to get my hot wing fix and their hot sauce is actually hot ! their homemade potato chips are my downfall .
american	not full of studying students with books everywhere that never free up tables . no , mostly locals . you have to try their soups . they are amazing . the staff is super friendly . i just discovered they have a satellite cafe at benny pool . same great food by horrible location .
american	this location is new , very clean and kinda stylish even . there is a neat little patio outside that would be a great spot for lunch with friends or even a short business meeting . inside there are many seating options and it 's a decent size , probably able to handle a crowd after a football game or night out on mill avenue . i love chick-fil-a ! just pray and wish and hope you don 't crave this delicious fried chicken snack on a sunday !
american	very comfortable spot , a relaxed , casual atmosphere . excellent food ! try the brussel sprouts , and the smoked olives . and do not miss the chopped salad . i will be back .
american	amazing food with an inspiring staff philosophy that gives work opportunities to those with developmentally challenges . nothing is lacking in this delicious menu , food , portions and good will . a must try .
american	the onion rings were great as was the double gyro platter . never seen a gyro broken down to its components ( build your own ) but found the end result to be satisying . we will be back .
american	the staff is extremely attentive , friendly , and helpful . the decor and design are impeccable , and the location is both convenient and comfortable . this place brings creativity to new heights , and combines the best of all worlds into one extraordinary place .
american	huge portions of great food at reasonable prices . a bit of a wait due to its popularity , but great service once seated . visited by the owner & wife at separate times while eating , making sure everything was on track . i had an an omelet and it was excellent and massive . potatoes were solid , and the toast was even above average . beverages served in super-large glasses , which pretty much eliminates need for refills and helps the waitresses serve everyone more efficiently . we will definitely be back .
american	the food is great , and bar is nice ... and so is the bartender . sunday brunch is catching on as well , with a large variety to choose from . the menu includes a really good salmon and they have a unique chicken salad that is quite tasty . i don 't eat meat , but i understand the steak is really done to your liking . they have a wine cellar with an excellent selection of wines to suit every taste . come down to my hood and visit this great place ... denny spyra will love it if you do ! ! !
american	great drink selections of all kinds and great food . staff are friendly and efficient . i highly suggest the brussel sprouts and the truffle popcorn as appetizers . the fish tacos are also delicious along with the brisket burger . brunch is a must - especially the bacon ! nothing i have had or seen has ever been not good . great draft selection that rotates seasonally and many other options for non-beer drinkers . great atmosphere although it can get a bit crowded and noisy on the weekends . highly recommended to you by a local south side resident !
american	we had the typical diner food of half a tuna melt which was on the senior menu . my husband had fish and chips which was large enough to take home for an extra meal . both meals were tasty . we also had a delicious warm piece of blueberry pie with ice cream . go here when you want to take a trip down memory lane .
american	their pizza is so tasty , even my new jersey native pizza snob husband requests it when we are feeling too lazy to cook . in addition to the good pie , i especially love their greek salad ! delivery is always prompt and friendly , and the food arrives fresh and just as ordered . in addition to the great food and service , i love how they decorate their front windows according to every holiday / season . it was the original reason i noticed the place and wanted to check it out , and the delicious food has kept me coming back .
american	well executed southern comfort food . everyone enjoyed their food - fried chicken , ribs , everything was great . service was exceptional & they had great cocktails .
american	found this place when attending a yelp event , liked it so much i came back . great service . nice atmoshpere . great alcohol options . i thought the lamb meatballs were so good that i ordered the lamb burger but was sadly disappointed . tzatziki is very good . dessert options are wonderfu so be sure to save room .
american	reasonably priced , good food and great options ! we can always find something for everyone . great location and walking distance to everything in the core !
american	i just wish they had more seats to enjoy their food . their lobster poor boys are damn good . if you 're happen to be staying at planet hollywood or paris , i 'd suggest just taking your food to go .
american	this is the real food scene in hometown pittsburgh . really decent portions of the best red sauce pasta found between new york and san francisco . worth the trip back to the ' burgh from our new desert home in baja arizona . tucson has got nothing like this place for quality and value .
american	if you want to get a taste of some great local food here , this is one of those places . i would recommend that fillet mignon . i got a 16oz special cut medium rare . one of the best steak 's i 've had in a while . i 've had the burgers here , and probably pittsburgh 's closest equivalent of rj grunts in terms of good burgers .
american	the fries are outrageous ! ! great place to go when you are extremely hungry ...
american	we had the large margherita . crust was light and soft with just the right amount of char and chew . the fresh mozzarella was perfect. with just the right amount of natural salt like eating milk . the san marzano sauce was rich and flavorful with a delicious tomato taste without being overly spiced like some places feel they have to . this pizza let the tomato taste shine through . excellent ! cannot wait to return . dave c
american	owners were the former owners of the greens supper club before a casino company bought that restaurant . breakfasts here are wonderful and won 't break the budget . everything on the menu is home made-- breakfast fried potatoes are handmade and excellent . for lunch or dinner , lots of choices-- everything from some greek food to burgers to pizzas to full meals . two rooms for seating-- the bar can be a bit loud at times ; the dining room is quieter and more comfortable . would highly recommend this restaurant .
american	overlooking the run way with superstitions in the back ground . fresh beer great service and atmosphere .
american	we recovered from a long hike at red rock with some tomato bisque and toasted sandwiches , and both the price and selections were great . we had pretty good service , too . i still don 't quite know what a pizzookie is . perhaps it 's best left one of life 's secrets .
american	a whole separate gluten free menu . beautiful decor . elevator for the second floor . nice seating . a little loud but they don 't rush u out the door . nice bar and dining area . a great location , a must visit
american	eight of us had dinner and all eight of us were totally happy . the food was delightful from steaks to seafood to salads . the service was 5 star to say the least . the restaurant was cozy and very comfortable . all eight ladies gave it a 5 star both food and service . we can 't wait to go back to vegas , we will surely have dinner here again .
american	i had the pleasure of having the texarkana burger . the atmosphere was pleasantly cool . the only draw back was finding parking close to the restaurant . the bartender recommend the food and it was delicious . i highly recommend this place for a burger .
american	well above average but not as good as some gourmet places that take burgers to a new level . plus , if you have kids or your a kid at heart , order a shake . you won 't be disappointed .
american	the view will also impress your out-of-town visitors . the appetizers we ordered were really delicious and the entrees we ordered were good but not memorable . we will definitely return to try more of the appetizers .
american	the people that work here are so sweet and kind . i tend to get the full breakfast ( $ 6 ) when i go or the jumbo breakfast ( $ 10 ) if really hungry . you pay beforehand and then they will bring the food to you . great sunny patio after noonish . highly suggested place
american	fun environment and is packed at bar close . they have unique selections of pizza . i would recommend the philly cheesesteak or the chicken bacon barbecue ranch . make sure to try their homemade ranch and get a punch card !
american	i had birthday dinner here with wine . staff was friendly and outgoing . food was the real treat .
american	very casual atmosphere and friendly and attentive wait staff . will definitely be back
american	love their raspberry moscow mule and beer options , and love their desserts ! wish the menu had some more options for picky eaters like me but a great pick for a nice dinner .
american	the hand-crafted cocktails were delish and the portions weren 't overwhelming . the appetizers are not of " shareable " style , but my scottish salmon was just enough . on a late friday evening , it wasn 't terribly crowded so that was definitely an added plus .
american	i 've loved this place ever since going there five years ago . great wraps , salad pockets , veggie combos , and a hot sauce worth sending to a lab to determine what 's in it .
american	be warned that wait times for a seat and then for food can be long on a weekend . our last visit involved a one hour delay between our entry into the restaurant and getting our food . we still had a good visit and will return . if you 've never been to a firstwatch , think denny 's breakfast , just much classier .
american	one of my easy non-fancy favorites is pizza and salad . pepperoni 's is wonderful-great food and great service . it does get a little busy on friday and saturday nights but the wait is never long .
american	the smoked salmon is literally smoked under glass . try the pickle jar and the time traveler cocktail . great unusal food am presentation .
american	the baked fish is my favorite . the prices are very reasonable with good drink specials . the wait staff is very friendly . ask for the hash browns with cheese and onions and you won 't be disappointed . they can accommodate large groups and are willing to make special orders . give them a try and you will walk away satisfied .
american	happy hour is till seven and it has a great beer special that is four dollars ! ! i got the five dollar burger which includes garlic fries that are amazing . i would recommend this place only downfall is to get these bar specials you need to sit in bar seating which can be crowded , first come first serve ! !
american	they have a rotating craft beer tap with excellent local craft brew to check out ! ! mikey p behind the bar will definitely entertain you with his great puns
american	went there to listen to a few bands in the underground as well as hung out in the lounge before for some cocktails . the people were very friendly and pleasant . i have even been there at odd times like 2pm in the afternoon for a drink and i 've always been impressed with how clean and friendly the place is , very nice atmosphere and the story behind how the place was built is an amazing one to say the least !
american	you can get lunch for a decent price ( ~ $ 10.00 ) the buffalo chicken wrap is to die for . it 's a nice place with good and healthy choices for lunch ... a real gem in a land of mcdonald 's and fast food .
american	ben and i stopped in before my flight from the clt to dca . we each had the 1 / 2 and 1 / 2 . i had the cobb salad with the turkey reuben . everything was fresh and great flavour at reasonable price ... overall a great value .
american	there 's always a wait , so be prepared . don 't dare walk away . on my last visit i got the corned beef hash with wheat toast and their breakfast potatoes . it was delicious ! i also ordered their mimosa ... which serves about 2-3 regular mimosa servings . the prices are really reasonable for what you get . don 't forget to check-in on yelp for your free banana muffin ! it 's to die for !
american	the carnitas hash are moist and delicious ! the bloody mary is like a meal in itself . the monkey bread is crispy and moist at the same time , really tasty but not too sticky .
american	big portions , good food and friendly staff . try one of their special versions of eggs benedict . these twists on the classic version are delicious .
american	wonderful funky-trendy atmosphere , tasty food , enormous yummy martinis ( ask for a chocolate one - you won 't be sorry ! ) . the people-watching is excellent , the patio is lovely , and even when it 's crowded , it 's still a really fun place to be . i 'm not huge on the lounge / club scene , but this place is a big favorite and an excellent example of its type . the waffe fries are yummy , the grilled vegetable plate has lots of flavor and terrific dips , the smoked salmon is lovely as is the ahi tuna salad . i 've tried a bunch if items and have never gone wrong , so take your chances with confidence .
american	i brought my friends here for traditional russian food , and we were not disappointed . my friend got the mixed platter which included delicious pilmeni ! i opted for the " herring under fur coat " salad which was delicious . i will definitely be returning .
american	not too pricey and the surrounding are a kin to a small diner . we had an omelette , lamb gyro and a turkey reuben . the reuben was awesome , served on grilled rye and coleslaw on the sandwich . the omelette was great fresh fillings . the gyro was frozen " gyro lamb " strips but we 're ok . fries are also frozen , the coated kind of you like that . cafe michael met expectations for a local diner .
american	good size burgers which are fresh . liked the crispy fries . friendly service . good size portion . check it out .
american	you just order at the counter and they will call your name - sorta like a casual fast food place but everything was just right . the chicken wings and fries were really good . i should have sampled some of their other stuff . they have sandwiches , teriyaki bowls , wraps etc . the service was great too . located inside miracle miles shop in planet hollywood .
american	fresh and a huge portion - i ended up with the gluten-free bites - just ask as they are so accommodating !
american	had a wreck sandwich , it was really good . the employees are very friendly and helpful . i will come back , next time i 'm in phoenix .
american	they always have new and wild items on the menu that are worth a try . and i shouldn 't forget the classic buttermilk pancakes . don 't forget great prices . live it up , you are in las vegas for cryin ' out loud !
american	three different sections of the room are decorated in different themes . the back feels like a room out of the french quarter in new orleans . the front is light and airy . great food , good service .
american	a great place for a romantic dinner ... street parking close by ... it was a little difficult to find , but i 'm so glad we did ... i wasn 't aware that it was downstairs ... we were seated right away ... got menus and drinks quickly ... the menu was short & precise & included a daily special ... our meals were all fabulous ... the bean & sausage soup was so flavorful ... i ordered the penne pasta with sausage & i 've never had a better italian meal ... my family ordered the lobster ravioli , gnocchi , and and the chicken pasta & they all said how fab
american	my friends and i were craving comfort food and stumbled upon the lakeview . great prices for what you were getting . nothing beats $ 3 mimosas . i got the fromage a trois which was melted asiago , cheddar and havarti on whole wheat bread . their sides were great . you had an option of a mix of salad and fries . i would definitely come back again for brunch with friends .
american	the food and service are always great , didn 't have to ask for much because staff was completely on top of everything . food was excellent and the mocha i had was one of the best i 've ever had .
american	their dosas are crisp and delicious . the hyderabad biriyani is mouth-watering ! the servers are pretty cool dudes too . on my last visit , i had accidentally left my umbrella at the table and walked quite a few steps away from the restaurant when the server comes running down the hill to hand it back to me . seems like a trivial matter to mention but i thought it complemented the overall friendly service i experienced at this place .
american	the owner is from texas and knows something about bbq , i wouldn 't hesitate to bring friends who are from texas here . i love the pulled pork and the beans which are hot but good !
american	everything is very expensive , but the flavor and prep involved in the components of all the dishes are well thought out . my friends and i like to come here to explore the dishes they make , as well as to taste some of the interesting cocktails they have . overall , this is a place where you can pretend to be fancy ..... and then you go to mcd 's to actually fill your appetite .
american	super yummy . the eggs bebdict and potato pancakes were wonderful ! the apple pancake was amazing but definitly not for breakfast . it was more like an apple skillet bread pudding than a pancake . but i love bread pudding so all and all it was still deliscious . all items on the menu looked good and the place was clean and trendy . the staff was really nice as well . we will definitely make this a regular stop when we are in sc . this is a definite gem !
american	i love love their orange juice ! ! ! friendly staff and quick service ! i always get the bacon , egg and cheese . i love to try their different bagels . they keep their bathroom clean and their is always parking available ! ! ! not too far off the strip .
american	the eggs benedict was the best tasted with enough hollandaise sauce . their fries have to be tried . the only reason for 4 stars was because they need some color in there to liven up the place ... dull nothing . but the food is so good that i will be back .
american	pancakes were yummy . side order of fruit had quite a variety . pleasant staff . service was quite prompt seeing that every table was full . i would certainly go back again and try their luncheon foods . reasonably priced .
american	for boarding pass members , there is a special price on their breakfast deal . ( eggs plus bacon or sauge plus potatoes plus toast plus a soft drink for less than $ 5.00 . ) the servers are very attentive and polite . i go there at least once a week for their breakfast deal . their burgers taste awesome as well . highly recommended ! ! !
american	healthy options are a must for me and they have a great variety to choose from . walking around the farmers market which is just outside the entrance is perfect on saturdays mornings .
american	the food is excellent and well priced . the staff is great and they wear pajamas as their uniform . get there early because the wait time for seating can be greater than 20 minutes . i 've been to this place twice and both times the food and service was awesome . the loco moco and country fried steak are great choices . also , try their french press coffee .
american	great food selections next time i 'll try their pancakes .
american	loved that it was buzzing with people & they show the football games on sundays .
american	they make a great reuben and the omelettes are amazing . highly recommended
american	they serve breakfast all day so i can basically have biscuits and gravy whenever i want here . they have all sorts of breakfast foods on their menu , eggs benedict , bacon , sausage , omelets , and really most of the regular things you 'd have for breakfast and then some . the inn has a great location and is close to so much stuff on coventry . there are always tons of people around and it 's a pretty popular place .
american	it took about an hour for us to get our food from the time the order was placed . i was a saturday morning and they were pretty busy . the food was good enough and we did not have to wait to get a table . there are not much breakfast choices in the casino and this one was on the average .
american	... reasonably priced , great food and lots of it ! lol i 'm on a road trip right now from vancouver to markham and i 'm just on the rod again from swift current , saskatchewan ! .... i 'm drooling for their breakfast and the 2 people that work there are very hospitable and have a great sense of humour that makes the eating extravaganza that much better ! ... they will remember me as the old insane long distance walker always wearing my bright yellow high visibility coat ! lol joe magdall ....
american	staff is professional and friendly , and the service is efficient . we loved the baked pancakes - one is called a dutch baby , the other is an apple pie baby . the texture is very light , it tastes like a combination of a crepe and a light omelette . very buttery but it adds to the charm of the dish .
american	the blueberry pancakes are so light and tasty ! incredible ! will definitely go there again !
american	the coffee is fresh and hot . the servers make sure to keep your cup filled . pancakes are light and airy . the french toast is delicious . thy also offer a 20 % discount for a yelp checkin .
american	they take real care with their menu and quality of food offered . i really appreciated that my pumpkin pancake was not sweet . that way i could enjoy the warm maple syrup without too much sugar in my breakfast . my husband likes their take on eggs benedict and likes the option of salmon instead of just ham .
american	a little pricey but so yummy ! ! ! ! ! ! came back and this restaurant , they still are the best breakfast in arizona ! ! ! ! ! ! !
american	i love the freshly-made bosnian bread and the cevapi , though the green salad that came with it was lackluster . the bosnian coffee that i ordered with the meal was strong and was the perfect beverage for the brunch . service was friendly but slow , which was surprising since there was only one other table that had diners during our visit .
american	i came with some girlfriends on a weekday around noon , so other than a large group seated next to us , it was quite empty . service is excellent - very prompt to ask us if we wanted drinks and was always refilling water glasses . although it did take a little while for our food to arrive , but not a problem . i ordered the mac and cheese which was amazing ! it was so creamy and i couldn 't even finish it all because the portions were quite generous . the whole presentation of the food , as well as the cute interior decor , is what makes this place so popular .
american	my girlfriend and i went here for brunch / lunch . the service was awesome as well as the food . we got there around 11 , bit of a line . but only waited about 20 minutes to be seated . the staff were very nice and welcoming . most try the mimosas .
american	consistently great food , friendly staff & mgmt . oakville needed harpers because most restaurants of this level sucks in oakville in food quality & service !
american	i typically get the caniac combo with extra toast and no slaw . everything is hot fresh and made to order . i only wish they had a ranch sauce because the sauce they give you does not seem to cut it for me .
american	great food and service . the burgers are what they do best , however you must try the mac and cheese as well ! ! yum ! !
american	the beer menu is one of the most extensive selections i 've seen in vegas and is constantly changing . gotta love the local rebel support too . after a couple visits , i decided to join the beer club and it was a great idea . a free beer every week . and that 's not the best part ... they even provide you with a personalized stein ! the food is elevated bar food , definitely better than i would have expected . when busy the atmosphere is cool , but i 've been there when it 's dead too . glad to have a neighborhood bar like this near my place of work .
american	been to toronto twice in a month and this place did not disappoint in the taste of dosa 's . the chutney 's were also good .
american	wait time was 40 minutes but went by so quick . bar , slide , music all available while you wait . the food was excellent , service was quick .
american	brothers , anthony and edward serve up quality food at reasonable prices . everything they serve is great from the hummus to the freshly shaved gyro meat . good salads , grilled chicken , hot dogs and fries too . it has a chicago hot dog dive feel ! that 's why i like it even more . but best of all edward and anthony welcome you every time you walk in with a big hello and smile . anthony is at the counter taking your order and edward is cooking away in the back .
american	they have gluten free buns and bread and the french fries are gluten free . a welcome addition to places to eat . prices are a little on the high side . they need more coupons and specials . very busy and noisy because there just aren 't enough restaurants in area . only have been one time looking forward to going and checking out some more of the menu
american	they have lot of choices and very friendly . food made to order , great taste and well made . from pizza to traditional punjabi food everything is great .
american	sit on the patio to peoplewatch . the service is good . we had a group of 10 and the staff was very accommodating .
american	i hope more people come here soon , it was really quiet when we went . not super fancy , a little pricey for a burger but so worth it .
american	i will be back this week to try the " liver & onions . the menu has a nice assortment of favorites .
american	i also like that they have different sizes of gyros so you can choose based on how hungry you are .
american	a great place for hot dogs and brat , and great on tap selections of microbrews .
american	burgers , oh yeah . the longhorn burger with brisket on top of the patty is to die for ( and also remotely possible if you finish this ) . great creative philly cheese steak spring roll appetizer . the bread is really good here , as is the service . enjoyed atmosphere too . a good stop . avoid the lollipop dessert though - not good and definitely overpriced .
american	my expectation were very low but chicken turned out to be quite tasty .... perhaps the bottle of wine we ordered helped a bit too ; - ) btw : even though the website and tickets specifically tell you there is no need to come early !
american	also great to grab when you 've been out all night clubbing and drinking all night . the steak and egg is awesome and at a great price . my girlfriend loves the country style steak and eggs as well . all the food is great .
american	service is prompt and the food is delicious . everyone around our table loved what they ordered and alot of food envy happened . friend swears by the charred salmon sandwich , which looked great and everyone seemed to like . i had the seafood pasta which was amazing , perfectly creamy and delicious . great portions and reasonable price . would definitely go back again and recommend to friends .
american	breakfast , has always been plentiful and tasty . burgers and hot dog each have their own menus . this past saturday 's special was filet mignon chunks with onions , pepper , and potatoes , two fried eggs on top . excellent . service has always very good and prompt .
american	everything that i have tried has been awesome ! the shrimp and grits are amazing and the local dish burger is mouth watering . if you are looking for bar food , similar to the prior establishment , you won 't find it here . the cuisine here is more upscale and a must for anyone coming to fort mill !
american	the staff is exceptional , april was the first to greet me when i moved from tx to nc and she made me feel great about being in charlotte . then food is always prepared fresh , served hot and they offer a variety of diner style cuisine . i would give them 5 stars , but they don 't have a full service bar which makes them not a top ranking place for me when it comes to relaxing after work with a cocktail .
american	the " penne primo " is super tasty and the bread / dip is also yummy . the service is always friendly . at around $ 6 a plate , how can i not be a big fan !
american	from great bowling to a relaxing time watching a movie . overall we really enjoy going to fat cats .
american	they have a great selection , even some healthy options . i had the egg white omelet . it was huge and stuffed with spinach and mushrooms . i tried a side of pumpkin bread and it was served warm with a side of butter . so good ! we had great service , and were in and out under an hour .
american	a great place for organic sandwiches and soups and enjoy outside at the sun .
american	the staff is friendly and good service . consistent in food and service . pizzas are large enough for a table of four and usually leftover carryout box .
american	they make the fresh patties on the spot with actual ground beef / chicken . the weekly specials are the best , it doesn 't get any better than 3 $ burgers . not too big on the fries but they do triple patties burgers ( i 've never attempted ) i would recommend this place . all their meat is also halal if thats what you 're looking for .
american	a small , elegant space where you get great service , amazing food and fabulous wines . bring your own conversation .
american	they are very attentive with the service , and the menu has some great translations for those who are not as well versed with the dishes . masala dosa-simple and an all time favourite is what most folks seem to go for ... the taste plus the presentation with the large dosa on your plate never fails to disappoint . i highly recommend also giving the tea a try . will definitely return .
american	bottomless mimosas for $ 20 . they even let me substitute grapefruit juice in lieu of orange juice . the filet eggs benedict is a special twist on an old favorite--- amazing . we sat at the bar and had amazing service from a friendly and entertaining bartender . service was prompt . if you enjoy a long leisurely brunch with friends , this is a great place .
american	very fun atmosphere , the kids will love it ! the waitress ( the only waitress ) is so funny ! don 't go if you don 't like people who yell or have a big sense of humor . i have been going there for quiet some time now and enjoy going so much . this is my favorite place to eat breakfast . they also do serve lunch later on , but they close after lunch time . otherwise , enjoy !
american	great staff to assist you with ordering . i will definitely return with friends . pittsburgh has truly become a foodie haven . scratch is certainly a great place for inexpensive good food and great unique beverages . the poutine is delicious . if you don 't know what poutine is , give it a try ! ! !
american	it 's tops in the market segment of , well , the market segment of hooter 's and tilted kilt . really tilted kilt is far better . the garlic fries i 'm sure slapped 2 pounds on my waistline but were fantastic . all the gals working - whatever their stage names - were positive and helped run food and provide good service . the food was consistent over a few days too .
american	hidden gem , friendly service , good food ! i recommend the egg combo and the coffee ... it 's strong and keeps on coming !
american	i recommend it to anyone who enjoys a night out at the movies .
american	lebo . we went for brunch on a sunday and they were very helpgul for my gluten free diet . i had the scrambled eggs with salmon and goat cheese ( delicious ) . the boyfriend has some type of french toast and loved it . i want to go for dinner sometime , they open up the doors when the weather is nice . a great atmosphere .
american	love the drink specials and the staff are amazing . some menu updates would be great but plenty of favorite dishes to keep coming back to again and again . love the salt and pepper fries and the fez burger is my all time favorite .
american	the ambiance is great , good food , and fantastic staff . i brought a few of my friends and colleagues here . i said try the chicken sliders . instantly they thought bar food , but they were surprised and found the food delicious . i am glad to have a place like this in the coronado neighborhood .
american	their pulled pork isn 't bad either . its always busy so best get your meal to go .
american	warm friendly and casual dining atmosphere , great waitstaff and don 't miss the oysters ...
american	it was recommended by yelp for brunch . excellent recommendation . the service was excellent , food came out fast and was delicious . the menu was extensive with originals . not just the standard breakfast items . lots of healthy choices along with a few decadent ones . made it very hard to choose ! i will definitely come back here next time i visit scottsdale !
american	veggie omelette and breakfast burrito were wonderful . good service and nice atmosphere .
american	to find a delicious , well-priced restaurant in vegas is saying something , so this place is a must-try . the decor is pretty astounding , and by decor i mean the wall logo that is on fire . i got the farm burger and it was cooked perfectly , and so big that i could barely finish it . after watching so many gr shows , it was a treat to get to eat at one of his restaurants . i will definitely be back !
american	the area is beautiful , music is great waiters are awesome . i have the surf and turf and that was great . the prices are reasonable . i know others posted the menu about a year ago but the prices did go up . such a great experience and if you are celebrating anything this is the place to do it at ! i 'll definitely come back
american	the service was excellent even with a large table . protein pancakes are amazing .
american	live music was just wrapping up when i sat down . they switched to a nice blend of rock music after that which was enjoyable . the amount of tv 's for sports viewing was very good as well. our server was informative and helped us make selections based on our tastes. we had a couple different pizzas which i loved . prices were very reasonable when you consider quality and location . the rosemary garlic fries were awesome as well . i will definitely go back every chance i get .
american	it 's a scottsdale institution . an old fashioned ice cream shop . a great place to grab a grilled cheese and a shake . it is adorable inside . it feels like you 're stepping back in time . they also have a room with some arcades for kids . delicous ice cream !
american	everyone there was super friendly . there are horses , chickens , peacocks , pigs , rabbits , cats , cows , turkeys , goats , and even a llama ! there is a $ 1 donation per person for admission . they also sell fresh baked goods , jelly , honey , produce , and fresh eggs . my kids had a great time and spent hours there . we 'll definitely be back . please note that the farm is only open on the weekends .
american	they also make their own little dog treats and provide water . food is pretty good too . love coming here with my dog and will be coming back .
american	it was a clean well organized place . the service was really good . the chicken zingers and sliders came out quick and hot . too bad they dont have any locations in cali .
american	good service and good food . friday night gets busy so go early . the bleu cheese burger had enough bleu to enjoy without being overwhelming . i don 't usually like onions but the onion straws at the bottom of the burger were not bad . the best part was the tangy sauce ! sad to say the chocolate cake with ice cream was quite dry .
american	great food and very good service . the views are spectacular !
american	i was reluctant to try the grub . georgie told me to try the grill cheese and tomato soup . i did and i liked it . this place gets packed early so make your trip to lost leaf earlier in the night .
american	i have only been to the bar a few times but plan to check out the upstairs soon . the regulars who attend are as much fun and notable as the staff , which are always friendly and nice . i haven 't had a bad experience here yet , and the food is always so good !
american	i have had four of sandwiches now and none of them have dissapointed . the service is also top notch . may ( the manager ) catered to our every need it was seriously over the top excellent service ! thank you
american	absolutely love the pretzel bites with provolone dip . you can sit in a booth and watch a basketball game in a fun & hip environment . there is also bar seating , where a lot of people seem to come after work . the decor , like at all sam fox concepts , is impeccably done . the service this time around was great -our waiter was so attentive , funny and thoughtful , as was the rest of the staff . it makes for a stress-free and totally fun night out .
american	everything is fresh and delicious and their bloody mary 's are on point ! service is top notch too ! i would highly recommend !
american	so many activities like going on a hay ride , hay maze , play area , a huge slide , restarant , farmers market and various other 's i 'm sure . i love coming here and making a day out of it . don 't forget to plan in advance , this place can get overly packed . sometimes , it may not even be worth it considering wait times . in the end , if i make the trip out to brunstucky i 'm going to the festival , but don 't say i didn 't warn you about the lines .
american	casual dress is fine but you also will not be out of place if you want to dress up a little . prices are moderate and food is great . although you may want to ask for dressing on the side if you get a salad ( they are dressing happy ) the deserts are so yummy ... we try so hard to not get dessert every time we go but they are just irresistible ! so if you are dieting , beware ! ! !
american	conveniently located on the beautiful main street unionville next to the old firehall confectionery , this place will not disappoint . we sat on the patio and enjoyed the nice weather , and the hosts made sure to frequent the outdoors as well so we virtually never had to wait for someone to pass by when we needed something . plating of the dishes were also spot on . all things taken into account , this is definitely a place i 'd recommend and i 'd come back here any day of the week !
american	definitely recommend . a lot of great workers and has a great variation of food and alcoholic beverages . i definitely recommend
american	i turned my company on to this place and this is now an office favorite when we order food in ! try the club sandwich , with the original sliced honey ham ... it just feels so right !
american	sandwiches are made w / fresh meats , and fries made fresh each day . have yet to have anything there that i haven 't enjoyed . workers are great and you feel at home when you 're there . very casual which is what i like . prices for both food and alcohol are very reasonable . give it a try if you 've not been there yet !
american	my husband and i went there to watch the football game . our waitress was extremely nice and was very informative . she gave food recommendations and was very attentive . the food was so good ! we shared the full rack of ribs , way too much food for one person ! the ribs were tender and well seasoned . the mac n cheese is the best we 've had ! ! ! definitely recommend this place !
american	the food is phenomenal . it does not matter what you get to eat , it is all delicious . the service is even better . everyone is friendly , and they are always willing to go the extra mile to make the customer happy !
american	especially if you are on a budget so you can have more money for the penny slots . sandwiches aren 't overly big but could be shared . bread is tasty and soups are good : )
american	friendly service with a smile . a1 food and bakery with a fair price
american	the turkey pastrami on a pretzel roll is probably the best sandwich i have ever eaten . the staff is great , friendly and courteous . service terrific . definitely deserves 5 stars .
american	try the salmon omelet with the goat cheese omg ! ! ! ! !
american	the service is great too . just one small problem that i have encountered was the butter they make had a long blonde hair in it . hey texas roadhouse please make your employees wear a hair net thank you
american	a great place to eat , watch a sporting event .
american	my family is half vegetarian and half normal . very attractive ambiance , attentive staff . everything but the lasagna can be made vegetarian . my daughter did that with the brussels sprouts . i had the beet salad and it was excellent . my wife and daughter split the seafood pasta special . it looked very attractive . and they said it was excellent . the wine selection is extensive and they offer great local beer selections .
american	i love going here when i travel to pittsburgh . it 's always a delight .
american	the food is good , the portions are generous and the atmosphere is a bit of country . highly recommend trying out this restaurant ! it 's away from the busy strip and has a nice ambiance .
american	the crepe-style pancakes were absolutely amazing - even if you 're getting an omelet ( mine was fantastic ) , split an order of pancakes with your friends ! incredibly friendly and helpful servers as well , with a great 50s feel . put it on your list !
american	had an amazing time with my family . we ordered poutines with maxi fries and onion rings since that was all we wanted to take in with the beer and well , we have a little less variery in vegetarian meals there ... but the poutine was amazing ! we ordered it twice as a matter of fact ! the place sometimes is really crowded and its difficult to call someone for service , but the waiters are all really friendly and really help u decide what will be best for u ! beer - 4 / 5 food - 4 / 5 ambience - 4 / 5 service - 4 / 5 overall - 4 / 5
american	i ordered the combination plate it included a side ( large ) well dressed house salad , and plate with delicious lamb chops ( 2 ) , marinated chicken kabobs , beef kabobs , beef kifta kabob , 1 / 2 rice and 1 / 2 steak fries , pita char 'd tomato & jalapeño , bread . overall great presentation and flavors along with very friendly servers .
american	the stetson chop , of course , is the highlight of my cowboy ciao experience , as it tends to be for many others . but i 've also had good luck trying other things on their menu , such as the mini mushroom pan fry , a less expensive alternative to the entree version .
american	i had the barry white ( one of the best pizza 's i 've ever put in my mouth ! ) and my inebriated husband had a mystery slice , which he devoured in seconds while mumbling omg ! omg ! omg ! after trying a bite of my pizza he drunkly stumbled to the counter to order himself a slice of the barry white . moral of the story is drunk and sober people a like think this pizza is amazeballs !
american	the burgers are hot and juicy also , the fries aw fresh cut and fried to order . it is a must stop for me when going to vegas . checkout their website for the secret menu options !
american	cathy is gorgeous , and friendly as is the rest of the staff .
american	this is a fast food burger place for people that a willing to pay a little more for quality . i got the bbq , bacon , onion string , & cheddar burger with smashfries . the egg bun ( that 's the only kind i buy for home ) is grilled and quite tasty . burger was delicious , though the bacon wasn 't quite cooked enough and was difficult to gnaw through . the fries were quite good , but left me wanting some sort of aioli to dip them in . properly cooked bacon & a custom fry sauce would merit 5 stars but i will definitely be back .
american	a note though though the wings are on the small side but , still are really good ! i love this place
american	this place provides great food at the right price . you get a huge burger with anything you can image on it . they all taste good . having the everything was the way to go with the jalapenos . the small was one hamburger patty . definitely a place to visit again . the roasted peanuts were great .
american	very casual , as you order at the counter and they bring the food to wherever you sit . they offer meals with different combinations , such as a sandwich with figs , celery , sweet potatos , fennel , etc . would go back to try other things !
american	portions are large ; i typically get an omelette and end up taking half of it home . its true you 'll pay about $ 12-15 per person , but for me , you end up getting breakfast and lunch out of it . i am almost exclusively an egg / meat / potato / toast breakfast eater , but the pancakes are so good that i order them from time to time . my friends love the french toast as well . get there before 9 : 30 for a short wait .
american	simple prepared well comfort food . the pot o bread is light and fluffy and very tasty . they offer a la carte smaller portions of entrées which is really great for lighter eaters . the staff is friendly and always accommodating . if you check in on fb yelp or trip advisor you get 10 % off your bill .
american	kincaids offered excellent service and excellent food at any hour . we typically arrived late , around 8 : 15 pm to 8 : 30 pm . never told that they were out of food ! the prime rib was excellent and so was our server , johnny . the staff was very knowledgeable and gave us great recommendations . we came here twice and plan to go a third time for lunch . we haven 't been disappointed and i doubt we will our third time . and btw , we tried the other places , i.e. arrogant butcher , and i have to say , that place was overrated and not worth the hour wait .
american	you don 't find many greek restaurants in this area , let along a good greek restaurant ! the plates are generous and full . great value meals ! the service is nice , the ambiance is nice ( greek music inside / nice patio right on yonge street ) ! the only drawback is that they take a little bit of time to get you the food ( take out or dine in ) .
american	tried the soup in a bowl-light bread with a crisp and shiny crust filled with new england clam chowder ! it was delicious ! ! very busy when i arrived but only had to wait 5 minutes or so to pick up my take out order . staff are so helpful if you have diet restrictions and quickly respond to your questions .
american	the restaurant itself is nothing much- not a ton of atmosphere . they do , however , have great gyros . their " world famous " gyros are only $ 5 each . they always taste fresh and they are filling . i also recommend their spanikopita and baklava ( the walnut one ) . their appetizer hummuses are not worthwhile .
american	matt & christian will take excellent care of you . the shrimp & grits were delicious - along with the malt vinegar fries . try them both for sure . the decor is undeniably amazing . a must " go to " at the aria .
american	fun atmosphere , staff has always been friendly . food is good too ( which doesn 't always happen at a " theme " restaurant such as this )
american	something for everyone and very unusual choices which are all terrific . can 't wait to go back . it 's a little pricey for breakfast but still a value for brunch . figure $ 10 per person .
american	go for dinner . or go on saturday night and have fun with tino 's karaoke . the staff is always friendly ( allison is our favorite ) . the food reminds me of the neighborhood places in chicago . great and plentiful . helen and cary make a drink that lets you know they want you to come back . and it 's fun to see the chicago sports memorabilia . and old pictures from home . like the newspaper from the blizzard of 67 . i always make sure to bring visitors to jimmy 's for a good time with great people . from the staff to the patrons . you always feel welcome at jimmy 's of chicago .
american	i like to eat in the bar . tom makes a nice drink and the staff is friendly and welcoming . give the martini sampler a try and if you can make it for happy hour , they have great appetizer specials . overall , the best value in brecksville . and don 't forget to pick up a loaf of their cinnamon bread to take home !
american	if you make a reservation , be sure to ask for the main dining room . the decor , from floor to ceiling , is wonderful . for a more casual experience , as to sit on the enclosed porch .
american	good portions , good variety . the staff were all ... happy ! a nice change from many of the burned-out staff at the casinos . well worth leaving the strip to get some " home town " feel . ray , the owner , greeted us when we came in . he shared with us that many of his staff have been there for over ten years , that says a lot ! and the coffee is even decent . worth a try .
american	service is fast and friendly . eggs are exactly the way you like them . top two breakfast restaurants in pickering .
american	our children love it here ! ( and the adults enjoy the food as well )
american	the place gives you that 1950s diner cafe experience . the food are simple yet delicious . i saw a family of 5 come in to have dinner and they seemed to enjoy their time .
american	the ambiance is interesting and pleasant , and the meals are always great . love the samosas and spanikopita appetizers .
american	great sea food , excellent decor and if you reserve , a view of lake monona .
american	they give large porportions so you can take out and enjoy later . try the blackened catfish it 's delicious . everytime i go it 's crowded so expect to wait and enjoy a coctail and if you like to dine in a quite atmosphere this is not the place . service is good and everyone is pleasant . nice take out menu especially when you want bbq but don 't feel like preparing .
american	tried the 6 oz blue moon which features real blue cheese . if you love blue cheese , you 'll love this burger !
american	good service , they have really good salads on there menu . i love the sweet potatoe fries ! there servi
american	share their pub chips with a side of their sauce ! i love the atmosphere on their patio with twinkle lights and live music .
american	the wait people are friendly & hospitable . if you happen to be in the area you gotta try their beers ! the menu is definitely above par than your regular pub grub !
american	a great place to go services excellence family completely enjoyed the experience we were happy to find such an authentic barbecue place we will be reoccurring customers
american	the most economical choice on the menu : hamburgers that start at around $ 10 . the fanciest will set you back a good $ 35 . the most memorable are the baby back ribs . whoever has had them agrees that they are the best ones they have ever had . the seats are comfy , service always nice , and i must admit their round tables ( for larger groups only ) do add a lot to the ambience . i can 't recommend this place enough . just go and try their meat for yourself !
american	very good beer variety and the patrons are friendly .
american	you can bring your dogs to the patio and hangout . the manager here is awesome always going out of his way to make sure customers are happy . thanks mike
american	fun to meet a friend or host a business catch up . lovely lovely establishment !
american	one time my husband picked out some songs to play on the jukebox but he didn 't put the right numbers in . so michael bolton was blasted through the restauraunt at 2 am . i don 't understand why anyone would have michael bolton in the jukebox anyway ? ? ? ?
american	we had great service and our food was delicious . the pancakes and gyro meat alone are worth the trip . definitely will be visiting again !
american	i think they 're 24 hours ... the atmosphere is boisterous with the workers singing along with their fancy jukebox , bumpin at club volumes . i wouldn 't recommend eating inside unless you like that kind of thing . anyway , even though this place looks kind of fishy , their burgers actually tasted fresh . they make it right when you order it ; so , it 's nice and hot . it kind of reminded me of in-n-out .
american	the food is really good . a tad over priced and the customer service could be better but if you are more concerned about quality breakfast / lunch food then this a great spot .
american	i 've had lunch there too , but their breakfast is the best in downtown urbana . i would recommend them to anyone as they have something for everyone .
american	a great place to grab lunch during the week and do some work on my computer ; good food and good environment .
american	not your average hotdog shop as their menu tailors more towards those of park burgess and union pig and grill . i got a chili dog , beef brisket , and a poutine . if you don 't want to pay and wait for a waiter in order to get poutine this is the place . it was amazing . the hot dog had a lot if flavor and the taco was exotic . if i could have a taco with just carne asada that would have driven it home for me .
american	come to down this place and you will surely feel at home . with their beautiful pricing on both food and drink along with their commitment to consistent quality service , you will love this place . head down to kona grill at around 4 : 00 pm , sit on their patio , stay for about 2 hours , and you will be able to look out across the horizon while sipping your alcoholic beverage , and feel an overwhelming sense of wellbeing while you watch the sunset turn the sky orange with stripes of red . then ... take a bite of your coconut / mango sushi . wow ... you can 't go wrong people ! !
american	ask for their tasting . they only offer pilsner so you don 't even have to think . nice and happy staffs . i wish they take over the outdoor patio area . awesome view of the cn tower and watching people on and off the miniature train is amusing . we actually saw an entire wedding party getting on for photo opp . hilarious to see their stilettos getting stuck etc .
american	the food and beer selections are very good . the service and ambiance is a1 ! my wife and i now have a favorite place to hangout .
american	the food is excellent . i recommend the awesome fish sandwich and the delicious wedgies . i can 't wait to go back and try more ! ! ! !
american	you get what you pay for which is a lot of food ! i ordered the tractor combo which came with two eggs and a meat orbiting around my 12 inch pancake ! i swear this thing was bigger than that . food is good the pancake was average in taste . i suggest maybe spending the extra 4 dollars to upgrade your pancake flavor . red velvet sounded good ! overall would recommend .
american	the service is always attentive and genuine . i appreciate that they let their servers wear their own clothes , and i think it 's cool that the staff is mostly ( entirely ? ) female in such a male-dominated industry . i 'm pissed that they got rid of their malbec , though . that shit was tasty ! and they have such a nice patio ... but it 's non-smoking . ew .
american	our first time there . the service was fantastic ! the food was great in portion and quality . many tasteful lighter dishes , perfect when you 're still wanting to walk around and site see after . you don 't feel too fat and bloated from all the food. definitely great as leftovers ! i had the salmon pizza with cavier , lobster risotto , shrimp cocktail and some sort of panna cotta dessert . i love the panna cotta dessert ! very light , refreshing and i didn 't feel guilty eating it .
american	they even roasted some sliced tomatoes for me instead of the usual hash browns . it was delicious . i have gone back several times and each time , i prefer it to the other place i used to go to ( as they have seem to cut back on quality ) so it 's nice to have a place you can rely on for a good breakfast treat .
american	felt like having breakfast for lunch & tried the devil 's mess with a side of crispy new potatoes . deeelicious ! ! the pastry selection is awesome ! ! from homemade poptarts to lemon bars . i took a dozen macaroons back to the office & all enjoyed ! ! will definitely come back to try other items on the menu & for happy hour ! !
american	listen for the specials before deciding , but ask the prices if your budget is tight . an appetizer can cost more than an entree . amazing tast . they have never disappointed us . fork tender short ribs . not inexpensive but you get what you pay for . a complete menu with a very knowledgeable wait staff . we 'll be back .
american	the coffee and teas are great . i love the white chocolate mocha ; your taste buds will love it , your hips may not . don 't go there expecting people to be friendly , it feels more like a library . everyone generally keeps to themselves with their eyes glued to their various screens .
american	i hit just over an hour on a tuesday night . the old fashioned burger was a true taste of local grub .
american	a great place to meet out of town family , have delicious food and ice cold beer & bbq .
american	the service is super fast ; our gyros were ready within 25 seconds of us paying for them . the gyros themselves were good too . i liked that the naan held up and did not fall apart halfway through eating the gyro . i also felt the portion size was reasonable for $ 5 .
american	the driving range is two story with plenty of hitting bays . it also has a hitting area on real grass but it cost more per bucket . there are sand traps and a large putting green with no cost to use . the golf course is a 9 hole par 3 . not a difficult course but fun . can walk or use a cart . the greens and fairway are well maintained . what 's nice , is the driving range and golf course is light up for night use .
american	plenty of nature in the back to unwind while taking a stroll around the ponds . there is activities there year round with evergreen . you can even learn sustainability tips in workshops that also include a cooking series and gardening . year round activites with the ice rink in the winter . always great is the weekly farmers market that is also year round . can 't think of a better place to be .
american	casual and yet classy . the food and drinks are great !
american	very friendly staff . we 've been here three times and have chosen different items each time . all were very good . we 've also tried a couple of the daily morning juices and they were delicious . thanks for starting our day out right .
american	the menu is ginormous . they have gluten-free options and can sub out any toast or bagel for gluten free .
american	we have had the omelets and they are really good ! we have been here numerous times and we have never had any complaints at all . if your visiting vegas its a great place to go to get off the strip .
american	the ingredients were very fresh and delicious . the bread on my sandwich was perfectly soft without being soggy and my tea was served perfectly . it has a homey feel , but is still light and airy . the staff were very friendly but kept the tables moving during a very busy lunch hour .
american	i ordered the double stack our burger which was stated to be 1 / 2 lb , which was at most a quarter pound with both patties combined . .. i also ordered a side of sweet potato tater tots which came freezing cold and salted to the point they couldn 't be eaten . .
american	after moving here from chicago to tatum ranch in cave creek , my husband and i stopped in for dinner ... so excited to have a restaurant close ti the house that could become a staple for us as we eat out 2 to 3 times for dinner every week ... well , we will not be back - drinks were subpar , service was bad , food was cold ... sad really - kick it up a notch of 10 and you could print money !
american	after much anticipation this was a complete disappointment , we stayed at paris for my boyfriends bday .. he 's a huge foodnetwork junkie .. took him here to experience some of hell 's kitchen .. we were seated promptly one of the hosts was flinging her necklace all over the place which seemed odd .. service was attentive although everything took too long we were there for at least 3 hours .. prawns were slimy and the beef wellington was not great we could not eat it .. after spending $ 300 you would think they could at least comp my boyfriends bday dessert .. rediculous
american	it is a lively restaurant at laplace near beachwood mall . it was a monday evening , very crowded , very noisy , tables very close together . service was subpar and rushed . our table had a chopped salad ( not impressed ) , filet ( small ) and some kind of breaded chicken cutlet ( dry and tasteless ) others have said that they had a good meal there for lunch ... maybe i 'll try again . would not go for dinner .... you cannot have a conversation ! !
american	awful . the eggs on my plate were overdone , while my daughters plate was raw . my husband 's omelet was wrong and we didn 't even get a sorry . we felt rushed to eat and leave .
american	without any hesitation , my friend and i decided to go here because of blow your mind amazingness of sandwiches everyone speaks of ! ! ! ! ! ya , no . got the club sandwich , and it was alright . the only compliment i have to give is that i ate the whole sandwich . i don 't know , maybe you need to be drunk ?
american	we were seated and told someone would be by to get us a started . 15 mins went by before someone came by , there was no one else there . when she did come over she said " well i guess it 's me , what can i get you to drink " we got the 3 meat plate ( chicken , ribs , brisket ) chicken had no flavor and was dry , brisket was 65 % fat hardly any meat . the ribs fell off the bone but once again no flavor . we also had green beans which were extremely oily and salty . the staff didnt seem to happy to be there .
american	this denny 's was alright . the staff were friendly ; the food was good ; and the price is what you 'd expect . again , this place was dusty on the inside . moreover , my wife sat in a booth where there was a piece of cushion missing . the " stuff " inside there was disgusting . all in all , you get what you pay for . it 's a lot better than the denny 's down the road ( which i would avoid like the plague ) , but that really isn 't saying much .
american	the burger i got just didn 't have a tasty flavor . just kind of sour and sickly sweet . i actually got sick of eating it and stopped .. which hardly ever happens to me .
american	the food is simply not that great . my biggest criticism would be that everything was dry . there are great places for middle eastern cuisine in the gta , and this just isn 't one of them . on the bright side , it looks freaking fabulous .
american	mind you everything was already cooked and ready . how can something as simple as placing food on a tray be so hard . either your managers can 't train or you employees are incompetent . this is my first ever experience with church 's . way to ruin my impression of this company .
american	i gave him my address ; i never received the card . so much for giving this place a second chance ! there are lots of other burger places in henderson vying for business .
american	i would love to talk to the gm but of course they just put that on yelp to act like they care about their guest just so you people who read this know where i 'am coming from i have attended culinary school and have been cooking professionally for about 20 years trust me when i say this , this place is a joke just another " celebrity chef " that whores out his name to milk tourist in las vegas , palmer has probably never even set foot in that restaurant if he has he should be ashamed of it . still waiting to hear from the gm
american	last time was very ( very ) bad - ended in 1 star ranking . so today ...... we didn 't get the salad we order ! ! ! just when the steak order arrived , i ask the waiter " and where is our salads " ? ? ? ? ? oh my god - what reasturant don 't understand about it ? how come they don 't understand that service is everything ! ? ! ? i giving them 1 star again - sorry - you don 't deserved more
american	the food is good , but not good enough to negate the atrocious service . the waiter was unbelievable slow , and seemed even slower once we told him we had somewhere to be . ( it was the day before my wedding and we were having lunch after our manis and pedis , and before we were to be at the reception site to set up . ) a lunch that was meant to be 45 minutes took 2 hours .
american	after 10-15 minutes at our table with zero service , no acknowledgement , not even a glance , we walked . sorry but we tried .
american	entering on a time crunch i said great not alot of folks here . we sat down first at at a dirty table and we ask to move . next we sat down for at least 5 min with no one ever coming to take our drink orders . all wait staff and hostesses ( if you call these folks that ) just standing in groups conversating . i used to love fridays and talked my wife into going for my birthday dinner . this place is an absolute joke especially with a $ 12 salad on the menu .... will never go back . jersey mikes here we come .......
american	staff was polite and friendly . food was not very good unfortunately . chili seemed off , chicken sandwiches were ok but not great . fries were soggy and limp . it will probably be another three years before we give wendy 's another try . just seems like the whole facility could use a drastic makeover . two stars for the polite staff-minus three stars for the food itself .
american	the lettuce was slimy , the mayo tasted rancid and the chicken was not hot . i threw out he sandwich . it was disgusting .
american	it was probably the rudest thing i 've been asked from a restaurant ever . i 've worked in hospitality for years and would never do that to a group of guests . awful treatment means that i will never recommend or visit this place again . ever . never .
american	worst of all , there was the lingering aroma of garbage , the unique kind of punch-in-the-face smell usually reserved for hospital cafeterias . i like to eat , so i tried a number of items ranging from pizza to sushi to seafood to pasta to chinese . aside from the crab legs , which admittedly were good , i could not find a single other thing i liked . wicked spoon , where i have eaten five times in the past few months , is the best option in town . then bellagio . adding insult to injury , wynn 's buffet is the most expensive among the three . also , the layout here is cramped compared to the others .
american	they are out of ciabatta bread - of course - fine then , i 'll have it on a baguette . after waiting 25 minutes i get my " melt . " the cheese isn 't melted and they left off the lettuce and tomato . this does not make me want to come back ........
american	the bacon was salty and dripping with grease . the eggs were powdered and hash-browns were like plastic .
american	i looked around and noticed a health code violation . drinks were stacked on top of each other and gathering condensation . trying to be discreet , i told the bartender . he looked at me like i was stupid . i then requested to speak to the manager- this is the kind of thing that will shut a place down ! i explained the concern to the manager and he immediately began removing the stacks and agreed with the observation . he then proceeded to wash the glasses over again and place then properly without stacking . glad they took note of an observation but why do the bar staff not know proper procedure ? yuck ! sorry i had a drink here !
american	i ended up with 3 lbs. of oddly double wrapped shrimp that was so spoiled they had to know it when they sold it . i used it for ( successful ) catfish bait and never went back !
american	my sandwich was wrong , i said no mayo and got mayo . another thing is i have a 30 minute lunch break . i ordered 10 minutes before i went to lunch and i got my sandwich 10 minutes before my lunch was over . well , looks like i need to find somewhere else that delivers .
american	that didn 't bother me too much ( maybe they were busy ) . so i called 10min after the order just to check the status . twelve minutes on hold and then i got hung up on ! ! ! 80min later my 2l soda ended up being a 16oz , there was no cheese on my cold , underdone pizza , and the wings seemed underdone as they were soggy and not spicy ( as described ) . this is our closest pizza hut location and i wish it wasn 't . we received poor tasting overpriced food .
american	the burgers were not good . mine was missing avocado . the bottom of the bun was over cooked . the meat was dry . if we had brought wine maybe we wouldn 't have been so aware of the entire situation . unfortunately we got one of the last tables after we arrived . sad as the waitress was very nice and apologetic .
american	after ordering two 10 piece wings with no sides i was more than amazed that these did not come with dipping sauce. well sauce was there for a price extra no thanks i already paid enough ill never come back thats like salad with no dressing
american	over priced food , especially considering the service . if the service is great i don 't mind paying more for even average food , but when you have to ask for things repeatedly and you 're ignored , it 's not worth it . there are too many other options for breakfast in the valley then to settle for this place . maybe we just had a bad waitress , but i 'm not willing to go back and spend my hard earned money to try it again .
american	there are far too many other places in las vegas to spend money and / or eat to put up with the rudeness of the buffet cashier , or the general treatment of handicapped individuals . it seems they are only interested in those who gamble enough to carry the supposed elite emerald card . and unlike most coffee shoppes and buffets in town they do not allow the handicapped to use the vip line . so long main street . you have a lot to learn about hospitality .
american	disappointment stings most when second chances are given . our friends chose the place for a double date . we were willing to go with a fresh new perspective . however , the same qualms we had the first time were accentuated this time around . most noticeably , this time we were also disappointed in the food . out of the four dishes we tried , the ny strip was the dish that stood out the most . indeed , the medium rare cook was done to perfection . that being said , being continually asked if we were done while food was still on our plates was simply frustrating and detracted from the dinning experience as a whole .
american	the service was horrible , the food was disgusting , we ended up sending back one of the meals and they have raised their prices to more than what a person would expect to pay at a diner . to top it all off 3 of the 4 people i went with ended up with some type of stomach bug . i 'm guessing it was the sausage links since i did not eat them and i was the only one who didn 't get sick .
american	big mistake . not only is the service terrible ( and slow ) , the food is awful . pancakes ? disgusting . waffles ? disgusting . hash browns ? disgusting ( and cold ) . biscuits & gravy ? disgusting ( which is weird , because the place is called biscuits ! ) . you get the picture . i 'd much rather just make waffles at home from a box then eat this garbage again . you 've been warned .
american	we ordered chicken philly with provolone and philly cheese steak with provolone .. cheeze wiz is the most horribly processed ingredient and we couldn 't bare the taste so we passed on this philly tradition . we ordered okra as well which was frozen but i expected that .. the ranch dressing dipping sauce was from a powder that i didn 't like .. the chicken and steak was that quick frozen thin sheet type of meat .. this was just not my type of place .. now i 'm craving a east coast cheese steak . .. $ 12 for each sandwich .. a , waste of money
american	took forever to be seated , greeted , and feed . our server was nice but because of it being a graveyard shift they seemed very understaffed . i ordered a ham & cheese sandwhich which was alright , didn 't finish it . wish we could have found a dennys which is saying alot .
american	buffalo wild wings was conveniently located ... the food , however , absolutely sucks . we ordered 6 chicken boneless wings which were dry and not all that appetizing . we also got 3 mini pork sliders and they too were dry and unimaginative . go somewhere else if you even remotely want decent food . lola 's across the street is a vast improvement over buffalo wild wings .
american	being ignored and dismissed is just perfect . yes , the food was comped after it finally came out ... but seriously ?
american	i was starved after a 12-hour fast for blood work at cmc across the street . there is little to draw you in , but once inside the staff was friendly and efficient--i like that . prices are dirt low and the food is basic diner fare . my low score comes simply from a lack of investment into the property . it needs a lot of tlc and one wonders if the owner is waiting for the hospital to buy him out . location is killer , ample parking , credit cards accepted , and you can be in / out in under 30 mins . the diner game in the qc is competitive ; philadelphia is getting clobbered by its peers .
american	she even called him by his first name " tom " as if by calling him by his first name made it ok to skip me . i just left the building after that .
american	honestly , the decor is nice . the food was great . but it wasnt that great to justify how overpriced the menu was . first off , the location is in a lonely and secluded part of old montreal . secondly the place was huge , so huge that it made the place look even more empty for the fact there were only three tables occupied on a friday night . lastly , the service was lacklustre and they served us burnt bread . i feel bad saying this but i don 't foresee this place being open for much longer .
american	wanted water refills and didn 't get any service . service was ok while tab was being built but once tab was closed and bill paid , service was gone .... non existent . never visiting this location again .
american	i was very disappointed . the food portions were very small and highly over-priced . the staff was friendly and courteous but not overly attentive . the atmosphere was ok but i have been to much better restaurants , had better food and paid half as much . i will not be returning to ditka 's anytime soon , if ever .
american	customer service is not a priority , when speaking with the general manager taylor hagor , he said basically - tough luck and didn 't even offer anything for the inconvenience . i will go to my favorite place next time instead of going to a place with no organizational skills again .
american	after placing our order ( breakfast sandwich & american breakfast ) it took 35 mins for it to arrive .
american	yes it was good but for the price we paid about $ 20 something dollars for two cheesesteaks and some orders of fries . i wouldn 't come back . our cheesesteaks were rather small and are sides of fries were quite tiny as well . the quality might be there but for the price is rather go somewhere where i won 't feel robbed .
american	he stated he would add credits to my loyalty card . that was 5 months ago . he never added anything or followed up with me . way to go landry 's bubba gump - vegas . still love saltgrass . bubba gump is horrible from bottom to top management . hard to believe an establishment under the landry 's brand operates like this .
american	the service has declined precipitously ( painstakingly slow , even with frequent attempts to flag down the servers ) , the food quality keeps getting worse and worse , and it 's lost the charm it once had 5-6 years ago . even my previous favorite , the parilla mexicana , was a disappointment on my last visit - the egg whites were runny and the presentation was a bit of a sloppy mess . plus they no longer provide toast with it anymore . you just get the feeling that they keep reducing costs to avoid a price hike . a sad decline for a once solid breakfast joint ...
american	after waiting 45 minutes the host told us she did not know when she would be able to seat us , and asked if we wanted to just keep waiting . of course we said no thank you and left pretty disappointed . didn 't need to waste an hour of our time with an empty promise , but can we really blame them ? they are just young faces hired to look good as you walk in . at least , that 's the way it felt .
american	i 'm not sure exactly what i expected , but sauce wasn 't it . it was good . not great , but decent . the food was fresh and hot . it tasted fine , i just wasn 't really thrilled by it . i just felt like i could have ordered a pizza from the school cafeteria and would have gotten only slightly less quality ( and no wine ) . oh , and the wine servings are very tiny . not a way to earn fans .
american	what a bad choice ! ! it started with the long wait to get service . once a waitress finally came by , i was told happy hour only in bar area although i was seated at table in the bar . i then ordered a medium rare prime rib with a side of coconut shrimp . the entree came out before my dinner rolls and soup . i was disappointed that my prime rib looked more well done than medium . the shrimp was okay while the marmalade sauce was entirely too sweet . never have i wanted to leave leftovers .
american	we all agreed , it was just average food and we would not be compelled to return . the server was nice and professional , but she highly recommended the appetizer and mains and they were simply average is taste . nothing to write home about . nothing mind blowing . nothing that said , wow , this is delicious . the atmosphere was good and our friends liked the wine , but the food needs to be improved upon . hate to see them go if they are locally owned , but not sure how they will survive if they don 't improve their menu .
american	well , to my surprise lamb is not an option . what ? mozzarella sticks appetizer ... really ? to me this restaurant is another sad example of the lack of competition , and the overall acceptance of mediocrity in phoenix .
american	first , the good . the ambience is fun , good vibe . the food was disappointing . we had chicken wings with sauces on the side , as recommended by the waitress . the sauces were good . the bbq hamburger on brioche bun was supposed to come with onion rings , cheese and bbq sauce . there was one huge onion ring ( too big for the burger and not flavorful ) , the cheese was a little sprinkle of grated cheese ( next to none ) , sweet potato tater tots which were flavorless . all the food lacked seasoning . too many good restaurants in scottsdale to go back .
american	the steak i ordered was mostly fat rather than meat . the service was great however i did not enjoy the food .
american	i was wrong ! ! ! the restaurant was under construction and had no atmosphere at all . there was a duo that played old school sinatra type music but they were on break more than they played . food was ok at best . had lasagna and a ceasar salad . just average . my date had pizza which was pretty good . nice thin crust and cheese with just the right amount of burn . only bright spot was the service . our waiter was very attentive and checked in on us frequently but did not over do it . i would be willing to try casa again but only after the remodeling is complete .
american	and having most of them validated by a employee ... thanks for saving me the waste of time and money . i am not 90 and don 't want my food cooked like that either . but the cater to the area residents. so what can u say ...
american	it was super busy when we arrived which is usually a good sign . it took about 10 minutes to get out order taken once we sat down and then another 10 to get our drinks . when the food came it wasn 't even hot . i had to actually get up and get my own hot sauce because it wasn 't offered or did our waitress even return to ask how the food was . they seem to be trying too hard to be trendy . they need to focus more on customer service and hot food than being cool .
american	unfortunately , i was a little disappointed . i thought it was just ok . ok food , ok service , ok ambience . the food at denny 's , ihop are about the same . i would give this place an average rating at best .
american	i ordered reshami kabob and seekh kabob off of their menu which came with rice and a small salad . i found the meat to be really bland and the dips did nothing to add to the flavor . reshami kabob when made properly is supposed to be marinated for so long that when you eat it it melts in your mouth , this kabob was completely dry and tasteless , a total disappointment . the only highlight of my experience was the naan . if your looking for something similar to la jawab in terms of kabobs and wraps try bamyan kabob , every single item on their menu is absolutely delicious , and none of these restaurants can even come close to competing .
american	i ordered the french toast , my wife ordered the sausage and egg breakfast . the home fries definitely came from a frozen bag . we could tell because they had 3-4 random bits of veggies included , and the chunks were seasoned perfectly even . my wife described her sausage patties as being " soggy " ( frozen food cooked incorrectly ) our server jason seemed angry the whole time . at the end of our meal he literally dropped a basket with the check and said " there you go . " again ... i don 't want to write a negative review about a local business in my neighborhood , but things need to change over there if they want anything over 2stars .
american	nothing was bad , but nothing was great . food was ok and service was the same . the menu descriptions are better than the food . not enough to go back for .
american	i might as well give it a try . since i stayed at the wynn hotel , the burger joint is just across the street . the date was 28th june , 2010 on a very hot day . i was seated outside by the hostess . i waited and waited for 15 minutes while watching her talked to the other waiters and looking at me . she then came to me and said my server was no where to be found . i then stood up and said " this is a very bad impression of the establishment " and left in disgust . i will never go back and give them a cent ..........
american	now mind you , we 've never been to chicago so we don 't know what a chicago pizza is supposed to really taste like , however , it was just ok . we had the deep dish stuffed pizza which after our first piece the dough was noticeably getting soggy . the taste of the sauce was sweeter than we are used to .... not a bad thing , just was not expecting it . we also had the fried ravioli for a appetizer which was also just ok , not bad , but not memorable either all in all , we have definitely had better and i don 't think we will go out of our way to go back , but you never know .
american	the service was atrocious . i had ordered the rib eye medium . after forgetting my order , the restaurant proceeded to serve my steak rare . when they tried to remediate this error , they proceeded to pan fry my rare steak which gave it a medium interior with a well done exterior . the service ceased at this point with the waitress and she did not even approach the table for the duration of the evening .
american	bad move ! perhaps it was a fluke but we had an uninterested waiter , awfully strong and non-mixed bloody mary oyster shooters , and two bland , overpriced entrees . i was excited to try the lobster grilled cheese , but it was incredibly bland and lobster was a little over-cooked . my boyfriend had the seared ahi caesar salad that was incredibly fishy and actually made him run to the bathroom afterwards . i wonder why ... ? we got out of there as fast as possible but not without feeling incredibly frustrated with the service and the poorly made , way overpriced meal we had paid for . will never go near that place again .
american	the green chilies were chewy and not peeled properly and the cheese in the mac was grainy and gritty . yuck . mac & cheese is by definition ... cheesy and smooth . not this . horrible . the good side was the pulled pork sandwich and the hot bbq was pretty darn good . all in all when i want good bbq my choice would be honey bears first . but if i 'm hard up and just gotta have some bbq , i would consider andrew 's again .
american	i wish i could say that i was blown away , but really i was not . lamb burger was decent but why put two tiny fingerling potatoes on the plate with it . either serve a side or don 't . multigrain salad was good but didn 't enjoy the shredded chicken on top . wood fired beets took on the flavor of ash and were not enjoyed by my group . wishing i had ordered the chicken and mac & cheese . waiter was friendly and attentive but food was not timed appropriately as not everyone 's order arrived at the table at the same time .
american	horrible horrible service , terribly long wait and very rude servers . food was decent , but we won 't be back .
american	i had the french toast as a side , my friend had pancakes , both were luke warm to cold and the butter , when we asked for it , didnt even melt. the main entree 's were so so , just basic. nothing really to brag about. we finally cashed out @ 9.55 , we were no longer gonna wait for a refill on coffee or a glass of water. i would like to hear from david and his thoughts once he verifies i was their
american	it seems like a popular place , lots of people and a long line . the selection was ok , typical buffet , with a few extra options and a mac n cheese bar . it 's just the food quality was poor . i can usually eat about anything , but at the wicked spoon , i couldn 't find anything that was good . it just seemed like cheap food . just gross . for 35 / person totally not worth it . the only decent options were the mac and cheese bar and deserts . ask yourself how hard is it to make mac and cheese ? if that 's your best prepared meal you have some issues .
american	i am from the south and the food we received didn 't have that touch to it .... even the mac n cheese wasn 't home made . i think we caught them on a bad day . it was an older lady doing her best to make sure people got the correct stuff , she was really nice .
american	i was really disappointed . i had the mac and cheese with chicken , and the chicken was over cooked and the macaroni was flavorless . it wasn 't an expensive dinner but it was still not worth the money . i 'm not sure i will try it again .
american	the salad was dry and barely any dressing in it . won 't come here again , rather go to messinis at the danforth or even jimmy the greek or mr greek express at vaughan mills .
american	it took forever to be seated and once we were seated , it took forever to get a waiter . once we ordered , our appetizers came out on time , however , with our entrees we waited an hour ! and they were cold . when we spoke with our server , he was rude and didn 't offer to take back our entrees . will never visit this place again .
american	i ordered up the # 20 which consisted of the salami , turkey plus added lettuce , tomatoes and onions . i also made it a combo which came with chips and a ( coke products ) drink . the bread was not the mana i had hoped it would be . the meat portion looks nothing like the pictures . while biting into the second half of my sandwich , i came across an unripe , almost green tomato ! in the family tree of sandwich shops , sfse is a second cousin to subway . between the sandwich and the overall vibe in the place , sfse failed to take on any mystical appeal to me .
american	the service was cool , the host and bar staff was great . our waitress acted like she could care less about us or being at work . the pizza we ordered was a sonny boy and the topping were lacking , we had maybe 4 or five olives not even while pieces on the entire pizza . the toppings didn 't even cover the whole pie . if i could sum this place up it would be : nice atmosphere but don 't believe the hype ! it 's over priced and the taste is not worth it .
american	the food was excellent and the drinks were delicious . unfortunately we had really horrible service . our waiter routinely ignored us and went to other tables multiple times . we waited about 35 minutes for one of our courses . we wanted to like this place , but after the poor service , we will not return .
american	service was excellent . i ordered ribs and fries , and they were very good . my wife had the bbq chicken and it was just ok-too stringy for her , but the mac and cheese were very good . she also had the apple cisp and it was very good . at first we were taken aback by the god and country jargon on the wall , but then we noticed the racist shirts many of the servers were wearing . we were very offended ! we won 't be back ! too white- trash for us .
american	price per person was $ 38 plus tax . but there were not good selection of food . they just has varieties of sweets and salads . almost everything was salty , too salty . the food is not worth of money at all . i do not recommend this wicked spoon to anyone .
american	we got fried pickles for an app , two milkshakes , frozen grasshopper and vanilla malt , and the billionaire and the rising sun . the fried pickles were okay ; nothing to rave about . the billionaire burger was good , but not worth 28 dollars good . if i 'm paying 28 dollar for a burger , i 'm expecting a wow factor with the burger , but the burger was just " good . " the rising sun was kind of gross . the whole thing just tasted weird because of the teriyaki sauce . save your money and go to bacchanal or something .
american	don 't get me wrong the staff was really nic e and the place was clean but , the food was totally different . first they got my hubbys order wrong , second our food came out cold not warm cold , third my rib tips were so dry and though most of it was inedible , fourth all the food that came out was sooo dry and flavorless it had no salt . what a let down and waste money . oh and by the way this food also gave us upset stomach and disgusting burps . ps i recommend the roadkill which beats this place by far .
american	came here late last night with my boyfriend . the setup and decorations were pretty neat . after opening my menu , all that ran through my mind was " denny 's food but double the price , " so i expected the food to be good .. or at least somewhat decent .. wrong . we ordered the sampler to share , and neither one of us liked a single thing from the sampler , if you want cheaper and better diner food , go to denny 's or ihop . two stars because our server was very nice , and inside was cool . food was not good at all .
american	the gyro meat was bland ... gyros are not meant to be bland ! we also tried the so-called spinach pie . again , it 's pretty bland and seems like it came from a grocery store freezer . it isn 't actually * bad * ... it 's just not * good * ... so i gave it two stars . there is much better food in madison . if you want gyros , go to the parthenon . if you want spinach pie , go to med cafe . if you 're on the east side and you 're desperate , go to dimitri 's .
american	that is exactly what it was . for ten dollars .... i would go back . some highlights : salad bar was fresh and had great wet salads terriaki chicken thighs in asian stationed were juicy and flavorful my man recommended the fried chicken from the american station and i like the collard greens and creamed corn . italian station can be avoided nothing special but did like the meatballs highly disliked the dessert station all my choices were super old and to dry or too soggy . stick with ice cream ! our service was good . we are gonna try breakfast next .
american	after leaving , i was anticipating a good review , but i was disappointed . the cards expired in a day . my wings had no sauce on them , they were plain ! i also requested flats only and that was not the case . boo !
american	the only reason this place is 2 stars vs 1 star is the very polite , make your own , pasta chef . all the food was very bland and the prime rib was dry and tasteless . for the price it is a decent bargain but i would rather spend some more money for better quality of food . the only thing that was tasty was a potsticker i had otherwise there was nothing to even discuss .
american	this place is loud ! aside from that the food is nothing special . just more frozen dishes prepared behind the scenes . the quality was no better or worse than any average place out there . if you want to eat like the majority and mediocre food appeals to you , this is your place . don 't expect the staff to be friendly as they are too busy to say much more than " you know what you want ? . " decent food is a lost art these days so do not think you are getting anything great here !
american	the prices seem to high priced for the portions served and additional cost for added ingredients . this is arizona , not new york .
american	i am sad report this is without a doubt the most horrific wing joint i have frequented in some time . my entire family are avid wing eaters and to think we drove from chandler to mesa anticipating award winning wings it angers me ! ! ! ! ! i have had better wings from the frozen food section at the local grocery store . if you are serious wing eaters , i suggest you stay clear of this place ! the wings , burgers , and frozen battered mushrooms were all below average , i wouldn 't feed them to my dogs ! ! ! ! !
american	well i still want one because mine ( and my girlfriend 's ) weren 't that good. the toppings were a bit tasteless so even if the crust was great , that 's clearly not enough to make a good pizza . girlfriend had a pretty bad stomach ache this night and next day , so i can 't tell if it 's from that or something else but overall well .. the pizza was not what i expected . dessert plate was sad and empty too . but cakes ok overall . quick service
american	i ordered a small fries straight up with no sauces , toppings , etc . i wanted to judge the fries on their own merit , not hidden or diluted under overly spicy , salty , or sweet condiments . despite the ' high tech ' fryers , oil and potato used to make the product , i found myself sadly disappointed . the outside of the fries were soggy , not crispy . the inside though was soft and fluffy . however the overall taste was bland with little flavour of ' potato ' . i really wanted to like this place . sadly it didn 't do it for me . service friendly , establishment clean .
american	while the dish presentations were attractive and the flatbread was pretty good , the rest of our experience was unimpressive . there are many other restaurants i would visit before considering a return to eno vino .
american	now that i 've been , i must admit that i was very disappointed . there were a couple of interesting shops , but even those i didn 't stay in for very long . some of the restaurants looked okay , but i didn 't venture in because by the time my wife and i were ready for lunch , we were more than ready to leave . and we did . we will not be back .
american	i waited an exceptional amount of time on a bbq sandwich and fries and what i received was not what i expected . my pulled pork was dry , it had great flavor but i had to drench it in sauce to make it chewable ! my sweet potato fries were seasoned well but cold . i was excited but now i am severely disappointed !
american	first off they don 't make their shawarama of the spit . they put their shawarma on the flat grill , so the result is a very pushy sometimes undercooked meat . and all their dishes are swimming in sauce . they are better places my current fav is the one on derry and tenth line . yum toasted pita off the spit !
american	we arrived around noon to a great looking location and presentation . food looked amazing from what i saw . we were seated pretty quickly with waters . unfortunately , my party of two was not attended to ( at all ) for 20 minutes . i won 't speculate as to how or why , but we ended up leaving without placing an order . i hope this isn 't a common occurrence , and that other reviews are more helpful .
american	the burgers were over cooked and somewhat burnt . the fries were the best part of the meal , and they were mediocre . the cocktails were poorly executed , the patroni was unpalatable , terribly bitter and badly mixed . the free drink replacement was also disappointing . the only redeeming quality was our server , who tried her best to compensate for an otherwise crappy meal .
american	the atmosphere is nice and the service was good . the food was not good . i ordered the appetizer sampler plate . the caprese tomatoes were hard and not ripe . the mozzarella was not fresh . the prosciutto was wrapped around cantaloupe that was not ripe and hard as a rock . the fries were cold . i will say the hummus nachos were very good , but since that was only 25 % of the dish , it did not redeem that food . i mentioned all this to the server as i think feedback is important , but she just gave me a blank stare . i will not return .
american	yes , the line was fairly long but we waited . very disappointed ! the omelet was dry and hard , very little flavor . the sliced breakfast potatoes were overdone and hard . biscuits and gravy were ok . service was good . would not eat there again . had a village inn breakfast this morning that was tons better . guess we need to stick to the chain restaurants .
american	what a disappointment . the service was really slow . we watched an entire episode of afv before our food came . we both didn 't get what we ordered and when we pointed it out , the server said " oh , i am really sorry . we are training a new cook and i will let him know so it doesn 't happen again . " ? ? ? we are retired restaurant owners from san francisco and we would never have responded like that . the food was just ok . we won 't be returning .
american	i am very intuitive about restaurants and hoped for the best . the bread was old and the butter strange . not a good start the setting is an old residence and garden and that is nice . the menu is eclectic and has a variety of choices for dinner , heavy on the meat side . each of the four people at my table ordered something difference , osso buco , the vegetarian bean dish , steak and chicken . no one enjoyed their meal - there was no flavor at all in the vegetarian dish . my guests didn 't like anything . the salad was lacking is variety with a little arugla on the place . not going back , and expensive
american	i ordered the omelette with hash browns and toast . once i actually saw the food i wanted to just walk out . it tasted 10 times worse than it looked . the toast was drenched with butter . the hash browns were definitely bought from the frozen isle of a store . and the vegies in my omelette were not fresh ( most likely frozen vegies ) . i dont expect a diner to match up to the quality of real breakfast places but i do expect fresh food . just stay away .
american	, also an acquaintance recommended that i try the bison burger . this was quite a disappointment . first of all the place was dirty . seems like the floors were not moped for awhile . the fries were cold and limp , the bison burger was over cooked and tasteless , the basic organic burger was the same . the turkey burger had some flavour and less dried out . the server was very friendly .
american	upon entering i noticed 1 other customer that was on the way out . i placed my order of a philly cheesesteak with onions & provolone . the to-go order was ready in about 7 minutes . overall , the flavor was good . the meat was seasoned well , with enough moisture . however , the sandwich was riddled with small pieces of inedible gristle ! ! i could not get through the first half of the sandwich there was so much of this stuff in it . in addition to that , i also felt that the bread was a little to soft for a true philly . too bad . i really wanted to like this place .
american	but that quickly changed after trying some . the fries were smaller and more wimpy looking . the gravy was really salty and had a strong yet weird aroma . i can 't really describe the cheese as my tastebuds were overwhelmed by the gravy . would i recommend this place to a friend ? no , i 'd drag em over to nathan philips square and get the best poutine in ontario from mr. tasty fries . quick guide to poutine in toronto : mr. tasty fries , poutini , smoke 's poutinerie
american	the food was fine , but i have had many better burgers . what was really atrocious was the service . our food arrived just 5 minutes after our appetizer . we were never offered refills on our water . my request for a dipping sauce for the fries had to be repeated . my request for a refill on my drink was never filled . the waitress disappeared for long periods of time . maybe the waitress wrote us off because we were using a group on - her loss because i tip on what the bill total would have been . the restaurant 's loss because i 'll never return . second bad service experience at a red rock restaurant ...
american	unfortunately , my experience did not come close to meeting those expectations . to start , the tables were placed too close to each other , so we were uncomfortably close to other patrons . second , the prices were over inflated . ( maybe they are capitalizing on ddd ? ) lastly , once you do order the overpriced food it is very underwhelming in terms of taste , presentation , and most of all portion sizes . the picture of my girlfriend 's breakfast sandwich says it all . in conclusion , i don 't recommend going to perk eatery . prices are high , food is average , portions are small .
american	the ambience and service were the best part- unfortunately the food was not . the food was served cold and under seasoned . for the price , i don 't think we will be going back .
american	i ordered the chopped vegetable salad . the portion was very small . the vegetables were sliced , not chopped . the dressing was tasteless . it was probably the worst meal i had in phoenix . overpriced .
american	we ordered the mac n cheese , extremely salty ; not only could you taste the salt but we also bit into the salt ... very disappointing . i would not recommend this restaurant .
american	what ever happened to 2 slices of toast ? well back to the potatoes they had just been shed or frozen and barely warmed on the grill i was so hungry after the wait to be seated and he wait time for the food i just ate what i could . when the waiter brought the bill he saw that i couldn 't eat my potatoes and let him know that they were undercooked and he said maybe next time they would be better and walked away . i couldn 't believe it ! ! don 't worry i won 't be back ! ! ! the place is loud , and not close to being worth the wait ! save your time and money
american	i was pretty disappointed . the menu didn 't seem to have much it kinda felt stumped on a few entrees . the service was slow and it wasn 't even busy . we went on a sunday afternoon it was not busy at all , yet the service very slow
american	bun not fully steamed , hot dog warm , mccain frozen fries ....... really ? montreal steamed hot dogs ? um , not in a million years ! i miss lafleurs , la belle province , montreal pool room and the hundreds of others who always serve fresh made ( never frozen ) fries , whose steamed dogs are always hot and of course a fresh steamed white bread bun ! there used to be a place in toronto called steamies a few years ago who were almost an exact replica of the montreal experience but sadly they no longer exist . save your hot dog money for a trip to montreal for the real thing
american	the meat quality was good ( we ordered filets ) , but lacked any depth of flavor . we ordered a bearnaise sauce and crab meat side , the sauce tasted like it was from a packet , and the crab was dry . bf subbed the lobster bisque for his salad , and again it was super bland . mashed potatoes were ok , but nothing to rave about . dessert may be good there , but we were too underwhelmed with the meal to try it . perhaps they were having an off night , but next time i 'm craving steak we will go elsewhere- i 'd seriously rank outback above this spot .
american	well it was a big disappointment . if you only want something fancy to look at this place is for you . many of the items are very uniquely displayed in little pots , or basket . otherwise , my advise is to skip it . the food wasn 't very good . nothing was labeled , and there wasn 't as many choices as most of the buffets on the strip . the line for the omelet bar was about 20 minutes long . they also had some breakfast taco , but no sour cream .
american	i went with the bacon cheeseburger which was apparently their most popular dish . nothing about it tasted fresh . the bun was nearly stale , the bacon had no crisp and the patty .... oh man the patty was very reminiscent of the patties you would get at a high school cafeteria . i guess $ 13 for a burger and fries ( no drink ) set my expectations a little too high .
american	the hashbrowns were burned on the outside and undercooked on the inside , eggs were a little runny for my taste , toast was cold and the bacon was burned . would not recommend
american	we got seated right away , server came by shortly . i didn 't really understand her explanation of the menu or how the " rotation " choices worked but she did seem friendly . our food cam out cold and the service was very slow . took 15 minutes for drinks . it was 5pm and they were not that busy . there are many food options in downtown summerlin , we would probably choose to patron somewhere else next time .
american	everything came out cold and looking as if it came from a can . the toast came our burnt and very cold and soggy . i would not go back . the server was great no complaints there , the good just wasn 't good . i only gave 2 stars because of the service .
american	while i 'm glad this palce helps out the less fortunate , the food was disgusting . the cornbread and biscuits were dry flavorless . i had the fried chicken dinner with mashed potatoes and mac n cheese . the chicken was soggy and not seasoned . the mashed potatoes and mac n cheese were not good . frankly , i 've had better food from a tv dinner .
american	may have been an off night but none of our meals were cooked properly or very good . meats were either over done or under done . desert was a rock hard brownie . between the five of us no one got a meal they were happy with . was very disappointed and would not go back .
american	unfortunately we will not be back ever . service was slow since we had to wait for our waitress to ask us for drinks after 10 minutes and waited another 10 just for the drinks . food was so-so ( except the milkshake which i must say was delicious according to my niece ) . but then we all got sick within the hour after eating turkey burgers and gold standard . not one in our party of 6 was saved from the need to sight see every restroom in the vegas strip near the cosmopolitan . maybe this was a fluke but i cant risk coming back here and being disappointed again .
american	the food was ok , but pricey . $ 160 for 2 cocktails , 2 glasses wine , 3 individual pizzas , 2 salads and 2 desserts . i know this sounds petty but they set a basket of 3 slices of bread at a table for 4 with our salads and when we asked for more bread they said there would be an additional charge ! tacky
american	completely unappealing " cheese " product . i ordered a side of creme fraiche and what i was given was ( to the best i could tell ) a cross between vinaigrette dressing and thousand island. after sending it back and rerequesting the " white sauce for crepes , creme fraiche , " i was given a processed version of ranch dressing . : ( sorely disappointed ! and it 's not cheap either. for my crepe and an oj , it ran me $ 18 -side note , no wi-fi either , so i don 't know why you 'd want to even bring your laptop in to do some work with a coffee either .
american	this could have been one of the worst meals i have ever had . i ordered the mushroom and chicken crepes , they were drowning in what tasted like a flour and water mixture , the crepes were like dough , ugh ! i got the onion soup which was salty to say the least and to top it off they served it with the filthiest spoon ... old cheese and herbs were stuck to it ! i was so disappointed in this place .... my advice to u is to skip it ! i have never given a review before on here but felt compelled to do the public a favor and warn them about this place !
american	the staff was very friendly but ... we should have known it was nothing awesome with plastic " silverware " and cheap paper plates . the wings were spicy but ok . the pizza was awful . we got the bacon ranch pizza and it was swimming in grease . had to use 3 plates because it kept seeping through . the white pizza did not have much flavor . to top it off , we had to clean up the grease mess when we left . we are just passing through . we won 't be back .
american	service is ok but the food is very hit or miss . when i moved to the laveen area ; i was glad that there was a recognizable restaurant so close to home but our first visit resulted in a glass / plastic shard in one of our entrees ( salad ) . so we didn 't go back for a long time but when we did ; again the food was just poor . the 3rd time got us another salad issue ( brown wilted lettuce ) and a chicken entrée with rubbery rice . i think 3x is enough is say that this applebee 's is just never going to be a good place to eat .
american	i got the pretzel sticks and lemonade . the pretzel was undercooked and tasted like a warm dinner roll with salt and the lemonade was really watered down . had a much better pretzel in the bread basket at mastro 's later that night .
american	we were very disappointed . the food is served buffet style with a fixed price . unfortunately , the steam table had not been turned on so the food was cold . we were there at 6 p.m. and it should have been hot . the two saving graces were the spanikopida and the squash soup . the salad consisted of iceberg lettuce and croutons with a drizzle of ranch dressing . it is a byob and they serve mint water at the table . i would not recommend this place .
american	whoops ! you guys totally let me down . the crab was still frozen and small ! ! the prawns were limp ! ! the wasabi was more like pudding ! ! the rolls were unappetizing . i could go on and on . the only thing i liked were the pulled pork pesto sandwich , candied apples and icecream . still nothing special . forget this place hit up bellagio 's buffet . same price way better consistent quality !
american	i went with my gf i got the philly ( wet no crunch ) she got the clevelander ( dry with crunch ) . the portions were huge and the bread was good however the meat was extremely dry . overall a so so sandwich and i won 't try again . i 'm assuming most of those 5 star reviews came after a long night of drinking because this place just isn 't that good .
american	ordered 2 hamburgers with fries and 2 milkshakes . they were alright , nothing to write home about ... usual pub / fast food fare . total ? 47 dollars 47 dollars for a server with 3 inches of makeup and fast food . i think i remember why i don 't come here
american	we even asked why they were closed , we were answered with " i don 't know , i 'm really sorry " they didn 't say one word about it being veterans day ( the reason jessica l. gave me via yelp 3 months later ) so your rude employee can keep her yelp responses to her self ! i was in vegas specifically for veterans day , with 4 veterans ! we would have said ok great , had we been given an answer ! btw miss priss i came in the next day and spent 120 $ on 4 plates so f * * * off !
american	the waitress did not allow any substitutions nor was she helpful in making any recommendations . when the food finally arrived it was mediocre - nothing special . i would definitely look elsewhere to get your smoked meat fix .
american	really disappointed today . cold dog and stale bun . and service not what it was . it 's a shame because the family and concept is great
american	tonight is the fourth night in the past year where we ordered dinner for our family via their website and the order was not received . when i called , they said " i know , it 's a problem . " really ? take the site down then ! when you call in it 's not much better . i 've received orders for other houses . i 've had my order not show up . excuses every time . their pizza is pretty good , but i am done supporting our local restaurant as they are totally unreliable and don 't do anything to resolve their issues .
american	4 / 25 my wife & i decided to dine at sapori 's . i called to see if we needed reservations . the person answering said no , this was about 7 : 30 . ( person seemed annoyed we were dining late ) we arrived about 8 : 20 . we were seated & did not see a server for 20 min . i got up to leave and that 's when the staff asked me how everything was . totally clueless . some workers realized they blew it . from the minute we arrived they acted like they didn 't want us there . they cost themselves $ 120.00 or so , plus tip .
american	coffee cup sat empty twice for just over 10 min each time . others that walked in got food before we did and once began to eat meal , it was obvious it had been sitting . disappointed with my most recent experience a generally great place to eat .
american	we waited about 1 hr in line just to find that there are a lot of empty tables and / or tables that have not been cleared . if they got their acts together , people should not be waiting this long ! food was mediocre at best . prime rib was tasteless . crab legs were very bland and tasted more like imitation crab meat . only good thing was sorbet . they had better taste than rest of the food . ambiance - 2 food - 2 service - 1 for front service , 3 for table service
american	apart from the fact that you can smell the slightly rotting smell of the dishwashing and disposal area , we felt that the food was mediocre at best . i 'm not trying to be mean , i 'm trying to save at least one person from spending the not insubstantial cost of the meal . i tried a lot ( from breakfast foods to sliders to turkey and mashed potatoes to chinese offerings to sushi ) and to almost every single item it was a big fat bucket of meh . oddly , many of the reviews said the desserts looked better than they tasted , but i actually thought the desserts were very good , and i don 't even have a sweet tooth .
american	unfortunately they would not honor the price because it was their happy hour . the happy hour price is not the same as what was advertised . give me a break that you can 't work around the register price not interested in going to sonic. disappointed kids all because you couldn 't honor what was advertised all over the internet . instead we will get our treat at bahama bucks .
american	we really weren 't all that impressed . the food was " ok , " the service was " ok , " the dining area left something to be desired , for sure , and was incredibly noisy . i guess if we 're around the area and literally can 't find anything else , we may stop by again ... but it was just " ok . " we don 't understand the hype .
american	we really weren 't all that impressed . the food was " ok , " the service was " ok , " the dining area left something to be desired , for sure , and was incredibly noisy . i guess if we 're around the area and literally can 't find anything else , we may stop by again ... but it was just " ok . " we don 't understand the hype .
american	the hubs ordered pancakes , bacon & eggs while i got biscuits and gravy . the pancakes are massive , but quantity does not trump quality in my book . seriously the worst pancakes ever , dry , cakey , and tasted like bisquick . the bacon was thin and pitiful and looked as though it had been cooked in a microwave . my biscuits were " ok " but they also tasted like bisquick . only redeeming part of my breakfast was the gravy , it was loaded with black pepper so it has a nice spice to it . all in all i think we 'll stick with our usual joints , the good egg or matt 's big breakfast !
american	both me and my fiancé ordered 2 eggs , bacon , home fries and toast . something that is not complicated , which makes it more disappointing . the negatives : my fiancé toast came cold . my hot chocolate came cold . the pink velvet cake was dry , really dry . for the price of brunch , it was definitely not worth the price especially since i could have made all this by myself and it would have turned out better . the positive : when my boyfriend told them the toast was cold they immediately changed it super politely . overall , i was disappointed with everything and my fiancé said he would never come back .
american	i ordered the brisket and pulled pork plate which came with generous portions of each however they were both extremely dry and little to no flavor . the brisket was a specially dry and pretty much blan . the cornbread was also extremely dry . the best part of my meal was by far the baked beans . the potato salad had bits of black potato in it so i didn 't try it . when walking in a barbecue restaurant on a friday night at 6 : 30 you would expect it to be full . there were five people in the place . i must say i was extremely disappointed and unless they change the way they do things will not be coming back .
american	well , not really , but my brother did , so we went . monday morning , packed . cash only , not great . usually cash only means better prices , but not here . for just under $ 30 had we each had the hash browns with two eggs . in a fancy restaurant i could maybe see that ... maybe , but this is not at all fancy . and they called what we had poutine , which it was far from . for a small , crowded , expensive joint , it was absolutely not worth the money , and i wouldn 't recommend it .
american	soooo disappointed ! service was also terrible . the burger tasted like it had liquid smoke . don 't waste your time or money here . try the burger bar instead ! my friend got the buffalo chicken sandwich , they even messed that up !
american	we were so dissappointed . the waiter forgot to take our drink order and came to get our dinner order before we even had menus . we asked about the sunchokes in a special and he did not know what they were . the bread came out chilled from a refridgerator and the butter was frozen . our guest sent her mixed green salad back because it was so salty . my " colorado rack of lamb " was 3 chops and two pieces of loin , too cold to eat . poached pair dessert was old as if it had been sitting in a fridge all day . chef , try to get back to your restaurant and see what they done to it .
american	everything looked so good so we stopped by while we were in the area a while ago . we got there and it didn 't smell clean ... we ordered anyway ( how bad could it be ? ) but it was just a really disappointing experience overall . the food was barely ok . we left regretting not eating with our family at the diner across the street .
american	they have turned off reviews , posted a statement , deleted it , and are now deleting comments . that shows me they have something to hide . racism is never cute . it also should never be supported . luckily you cant delete yelp reviews ( :
american	they have apparently changed their menu and it is awful . i got the chicken gyro bowl and the meat did not even resemble chicken . the rice was flavorless . there was no hummus . my girlfriend got the falafal sandwich was better than the chicken bowl , but it was burned . nothing was worth the price paid . everything was served off of styrofoam and we were the only customers for about an hour period . too bad they used to be fantastic ... we won 't be returning .
american	huge disappointment . the pizza tasted like we were eating leftovers and it was mediocre at best . we also tried the wings which tasted freezer burned and like they had been boiled and then tossed in sauce . i really wanted to like this place because the staff was so nice but was really disappointed in the quality of the food . the more i thought about it the more i felt like i got ripped off ( $ 28 for leftover pizza and tasteless wings ) . will not be visiting again .
american	realistically , i assumed the food would probably be great and service just as good , but i was wrong . the food was all undercooked and simply didn 't taste good . on top of that the service was incredibly slow and you could cut the tension with a knife in that place . it was an awful experience and felt so awkward . i 'd never go back again . terrible food , terrible service .
american	however , what a disappointment ! the service was slow and the food was mediocre . evidently the people that were giving the high remarks have never had panera , jj 's , or even penn station . can 't really say anything was good here .
american	all 4 of our sandwiches came on a stale pita that was soaked in grease ... yuck . typically , fat equals flavor but when it came to the gyro meat we found it to be mealy , full of gristle , and lacking any sort of flavor at all . on a positive note the owner seemed very nice but he needs to freshen up the restaurant and buy a higher quality meat if he hopes to make it another 25 years !
american	i took my mother and grandmother for dinner on a sunday night . i was terribly disappointed . i had a mediocre meal for a mediocre price . my pasta tasted like it came from a can . the caesar salad was limp and had cheap parmesan cheese on top . the waiter was rude , impatient , and unfriendly . i will not go back . i do not recommend this place . there are too many restaurants in the beach to settle for mediocrity .
american	we ordered a chicken caesar salad it was so bland we sent it back . our main dishes were nothing special and the tiramisu is also tasteless . i was pretty disappointed and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone based off the food . i will not be returning .
american	when we got home we were highly disappointed in the portion size ! somebody was not paying attention when portioning out the food , as one of our meals was a 3-piece dark meat . someone didn 't notice we only actually got two pieces of chicken . the leg meat of one piece had fallen to the side . so , we actually got two pieces and a meatless bone . the food quality was still yummy however frustrating to not see this error until we 're unpackaging the food at home . boston market is not one of the cheaper options for dinner , so it is expected to get what you 're paying for . and this case we did not .
american	after sending a follow up review and a tweet to the ceo of the restaurant i did receive a response from the director of restaurants .
american	we ordered the bubba 's benny and the description was completely wrong. it said it came with homemade buiscuts and sausage and eggs topped with turkey sausage gravy. that was not homemade and there was no sausage and the sausage gravy was hollandaise sauce . this was not as advertised at all and i will never go here again !
american	what a mistake . food is limp and tasteless . place was empty , but service was still slow and poor . oh , and the price has gone up . as a matter of fact , i visit this center a few times a week , and joey 's is always empty . no mystery why .
american	every time order a single meal it 's always lean meat and delicious . however , the prepped meals are so fatty and often undercooked i can 't even eat it . i was super excited to find this place but have decided to give up .
american	it goes around like 30 times making the wait forever. it would make more sense to only go around 10 times so the turnover for the line would be much faster . there 's literally no point in riding it again . it makes no sense to have half your visit spent waiting in line and then the other half spent in the actual ride doing the same thing over and over again for eternity . this is ridiculous .
american	steaks not cooked to correct temperature . service on point but this place is more of a place to be seen that to get a good quality meal ... especially for what you pay .
american	unfortunately , chick-fil-a 's chicken strips are 1 / 3 smaller than kfc 's and cost more . my recommendation to chick-fil-a is to removed the chicken strips from their menu . c brandt
american	it was 10 bucks with a drink since i did not have a coupon . its a very small salad bar . everything looked fresh enough but there was not the variety you get @ sweet tomatoes . they only had 3 kinds of soup plus chili . the baked breads were pretty empty and looked less than fresh . the highlight was the sponge cake and strawberries & whipped cream . i love strawberry shortcake ! i dont think i will be coming back anytime soon .
american	ordered my sandwich then was told that they did not have any tomatoes at all . i found that to be very odd when the restaurant is located across from the produce department . they also said they were unable to serve me a bowl of soup with my no tomato sandwich . was not happy at all
american	service was fairly quick at 6 : 30 a.m. however , the food was completely unsatisfying and over priced . usually , everything just tastes great when you 're drunk and hungry but not this time . from the little i do remember , the 22 steak was thin , bland and overcooked . definitely not going here again .
american	the gravy is an odd mix of salt , sugar and a dash of beef flavor sort of like the flavour of those fries and gravy chips you sometimes see . if i were lost in the woods for days before coming by this place , i 'd probably just eat one of the servers . the service was quick .
american	after signing in to be seated and waiting 20 minutes on a tuesday at 2 : 40pm , we decided to leave because of lack of acknowledgement and poor service .
american	the service was slow ( under staffed ) and their attitude was " they were doing us a favor " ! customer service needs to be the priority folks ! chandler will not support a restaurant establishment with such low standards . this town is too small to have big city attitude . stay in scottsdale .
american	not once during that time did she come to our to to refill our drinks . not to mention she didn 't think to ask the kitchen why our order wasn 't up yet . will not return . such bad service .
american	but not before the hostess said thanks for coming in . needles to say i will not be returning .
american	came to this buffet and to our dismay it closes at 10 .. it was 10 05 . what kinda place in vegas closes at 10 . isnt this the city that never sleeps ? wtf . spend all my money at the tables and come to eat and its closed . and the women at the cashiers station are awfully rude . was unaware that another part of the restaurant was open and before leaving another guest told us the ( cafe ) was open its located towards the back of the restaurant . overall get workers that appreciate their jobs and have better customer service people . unhappy guest .
american	the hostess was extremely rude and unapologetic about skipping over us . we left without even eating . i don 't care how good your food is if you have service that bad .
american	unlike the kj , the bar staff was attentive and friendly . if i 'm in town i may be back , but if the same guy is behind the desk i 'll move on .
american	i give four starts to their vegetarian soups , but have little else good to say . its offerings for vegetarians are limited . its portabello sandwich is extremely mediocre : large pieces of mushroom between ( unhealthy ) pieces of fried bread . condiments are sparse : try getting honey to put in your tea or a dark , spicy mustard and you 'll come up empty . service can be good to fairly awful . i 've concluded that the reason that this restauarant is so popular is that there are so relatively few options on madison 's near-west side .
american	in its early days we were frequent visitors , coming partly for the good food and the continental atmosphere . unfortunately , this time we found neither . if you must eat at coffee mill stick to some of the pastries , and if you are looking for some continental atmosphere close your eyes and dream that you are in vienna . for the sake of the good old times i gave a 2 star . food lover
american	if time hadn 't been an issue i would have driven back but being i was running late i couldn 't . they did not even lift the hatch to vacuum the back and did not wipe down the exterior . the inside was extremely shoddy as well . water spots were all over the exterior , as noticed upon closer inspection and i had paid the extra money for a wax job . obviously , i got waxed on this deal ! ! time to find a new car wash . i will never go back . not such a fabulous job ! !
american	we are all in our mid twenties just walked in the bar . i questioned him on why he thought that and he got irate . stay away ! ! ! ! ! !
american	we sat at the bar as it was happy hour . ruben was our bartender . ruben greeted us and we proceeded to order a app and 2 chilean sea bass entree 's . while sitting at the bar i noticed 2 things which bothered me . 1 . the reach-ins were / are filthy and the bar was by no means busy . 2 . workers talking instead of cleaning . i have a real problem with dirty dining . totally unacceptable . we will definitely not be back
american	checked on who delivered and chose this restaurant . ordering was easy but really , you charge for forks . you would think your patrons might want to eat the food ... ordered the brisket plate with okra and potato salad and the chicken fingers with mac and cheese and coleslaw . the best part of the meal were the side dishes . the chicken fingers were so overcooked that i only ate one and threw the rest away but the slaw was tasty as was the mac and cheese . the brisket faired somewhat better but overall a huge disappointment . delivery was fairly fast but be careful because they automatically add a tip to the bill .
american	with high hopes and an empty stomach , i sat down only to be greeted by a brunch menu - with no steak sandwich in sight . i left broken hearted and hungry ! ! !
american	ty service where they took 20 minutes just to take our drink order , the manager and the hostess accused us of dining and ditching . don 't come here if you can avoid it .
american	worst idea yet . $ 11 chicken fingers looked like a school lunch and my wife steak sandwich was the worst ever . the bartender never even acknowledged us ? well just a warning for the next couple who walks in .... turn around and go .....
american	we settled on planet dailies because it was back at our hotel and i had a coupon . they didn 't have a veggie burger , i guess everyone in vegas are carnivores , so we settled on lettuce wraps and fries . the wraps were just okay , the fries were fries , nothing fancy . the place is huge and it is open 24 hours and near the prive nightclub , so it would be good group spot after clubbing , but the prices were kinda high for the quality of food . we should 've gone to the sandwich of earl instead .
american	the menu had a wide selection of food to satisfy everyones taste . we ordered the basil pesto linguine , the chefs salad and various sushi . the wait time on the food was a little long for the amount of business they had . the flavor of the dishes were average with nothing standing out . typical mall restaurant , average food for above average prices . i dont know why i was expecting anything different .
american	the waitress explain to me i could not switch a potatoe on the chicken entree for a vegetable , without a up charge , instead she offered me potatoe chips ! ! ! ! at 13.99 for a chicken entree you should be able to switch to a vegetable on an entree ! ! come guys 13.99 entree and you offer potatoe chips as a substitute , what are we at mc donalds ! ! i won 't be back , very tacky ! and cheap ! anthony
american	not sure how people give positive reviews of their gyro . not that the tzatziki sauce was rotten , it just was not tzatziki sauce . it was more like mayo . staff was friendly ; service was rather fast , given that there were only 8 people in the entire restaurant . would have given one star without the kindness . did see a large plate of baked spaghetti on the way out that looked good , but who knows ?
american	if you 're going to be a nurse working with children , i suggest you have a bit more patience and compassion . and threatening kids is not a good idea either . i walked out of there so angry and upset while trying to calm my son down . i just cannot believe this horrible experience . sorry pch , you lost my patronage .
american	unfortunately , the second time i 've come the experience was not quite the same . the food was mediocre at its best . so now for two unlimited mimosas , chilequiles , angus beef hash , and toast left us at $ 77.00 . they were not huge portions but thought they would have been based off of the price very disappointing . in my opinion , the brunch menu should have more of a variety and offer more food . it doesn 't help that we overhear the staff complaining about the tip . very unprofessional .... very unlikely that i will return to this establishment . disappointment is an understatement .
american	unfortunately the second trip was just as disappointing as the first . i got something called " the volcano " which is just eggs , pancakes , sausage and bacon ( not sure how that warrants the name " volcano . " ) the eggs were bland , as were the pancakes . the bacon and sausage was pretty good . nothing special . the server was friendly . black bear diner is really just a denny 's with a bear / mountain theme .
american	another 35 minutes passed before we received our water and then drink orders . the manager did absolutely nothing .
american	the brunch options were kind of blah . i wanted to get peanut butter ( or jam ) for my english muffin , but they didn 't have any . i thought i 'd try the french toast but didn 't when they let me know that they didn 't have syrup . there are so many amazing breakfast and brunch spots in az , there really is no reason at all to go to z tejas for brunch . maybe they should stick to lunch and dinner .
american	however , for some reason the food was just not as good as i 've come to expect . the corn dog tasted oily like they needed to change out the fryer oil . we spent $ 9 for two hot dogs on a stick and we could have eaten somewhere else : ( . sad sad sad .
american	the more time has gone on , however , this location has seriously gone down hill . if they don 't screw up your order the food is usually bad . just visited this location for a chicken wrap . got it home and the chicken piece was seriously the size of chicken nugget . give me a break . i will no longer be visiting this location . tired of being disappointed when i am hungry !
american	the original rudy 's used to be our families favorite but after the switch , it hasn 't been the same . food was undercooked and overpriced . service was prompt but the place was very dirty . the simple fact that their sign says " eat here i need the money " and they charge $ 3 to use a credit card says it all . i hope someone can turn it around .
american	the place was clean , the games were on tv , the service was okay , but the food ..... spend your money somewhere else ! you get more breading than chicken , the wing sizes are terrible and it 's just not good period . also , my husband ordered a moscow mule , he got a nasty drink in a glass tea cup . wtf . not impressed and never going back .
american	each call i made was transferred and i was told to leave a message . i sure hope we will be accommodated this evening at 7 : 00 ? i which i will change my review at that time ! so far , poor team management !
american	nobody i have ever been here with thinks the beer is any good , either . on the last visit , the service was also ridiculously snooty and pretentious . the success of this place seems to be based on a conspiracy of people who don 't know beer and people who think they are all terribly hip and special . i am never going back .
american	save your money , try old school pizzeria directly across from the cannery . it 's a bit of a drive for me but my family and i deserve quality food made with fresh ingredients and care . try old school pizzeria , you will not be disappointed .
american	the manager on duty told us the cook was struggling and was not able to serve the 12 of us in a timely manner . there was two other customers in the restaurant . it was 3am ! ! needless to say we left and went to denny 's the next exit down . i 've never known a restaurant to turn down business . i wish i could give them zero stars .
american	after trying boiling crab in la .. we decided to try hot n juicy since it seems some what similar .. parking is easy since there is a big parking lot .. order few lbs of shrimp , few lbs of crawfish , sweet potato fries , fried catfish ... for the shrimp and crawfish we had half of it with the garlic butter sauce and the other half with hot n juicy special sauce .. to me the food is below average .. the flavors here is just ok .. only order i really enjoyed was just the fried cat fish .. i probably would not come back here if i were to return and visit vegas ..
american	after trying both locations , i find the portions small and relatively expensive. you can find better fried chicken at raising canes , for example .
american	again , very disappointed with the food . my burger was supposed to be med well and it came out rare , his was supposed to be med rare and came out rare . i took a few bites . couldn 't finish it . the fries were mushy again . i do wish our second experience were different than our first . but , it was actually worse . i hate leaving bad reviews . but , we will not be returning a third time .
american	the burgers are skimpy , about 2oz . , so you really need to order at least a double . both the burger and fries are bland , had to add salt , and the fries although they are cut fresh are never crisp , maybe the use oil lower in saturated fat ? i gave it two stars for the ingredients being fresh , but i 'd rather have a thick juicy burger , and crispy fries , that you can get fresh at other restaurants easily .
american	the burgers were not that tasty and the fries were limp and not crunchy . they handled the crowd decently enough and had plenty of employees on hand . i wish my experience was better . i won 't return . i 'm not sure what people back east see in this place , cause i sure don 't see it . other than my experience , if you like the food then they did just fine on all other points .
american	do not expect great service . we did not get a bread basket , had to ask 2-3 times for refills , and apparently annoyed another waiter for a form when our waiter went m.i.a. again . ordered the beet salad and calamari . beet salad was tasty - calamari could have been fried a few more moments but decent . rotisserie chicken was eh - and dumping the chicken on the mashed potatoes made it seem like chicken little had fallen from the sky .
american	the first time , i believed it was a mistake . the second time makes me think that this is a habit . when called to the waiter 's attention , he immediately knew what we were talking about without even looking at the bill . i suggest this bar , but you do need to keep a close eye on your tab .
american	online it states all burgers come with a side of fries and after seeing great reviews for their food , it 's annoying to come home to find out you didn 't get everything as expected and no receipt as well .
american	the ribs were firm and not falling off the bone like it should . and the beef brisket was dry and seemed like it was sliced hours earlier . even the corn on the cob was bad - tasteless until i added butter and salt . how can a bbq specialty restaurant be so bad ?
american	why you ask ? because for the prices the food is dramatically under-seasoned and just flat out underwhelming . grumpy 's should be considered a last resort when you have exhausted all other tremont and ohio city eateries . and the dry erase board that they move around from table to table with the specials ( and prop up against your table so the table next to you can read the specials ) is amateur . have your waitstaff memorize the specials instead of inconveniencing other diners .
american	initially , the food was great . it was fried to order and the size of the chicken pieces were much larger than you would get at other places . i stopped last sunday and ordered a leg and thigh combo . the size of the chicken they serve has gotten significantly smaller . it also tasted more like catfish than chicken . i think the management has changed hands several times . sigh . too bad
american	i 'm not sure how much mr ramsey is associated with the restaurant but this was without doubt the worst $ 250 meal for two we 've ever had . the quality of the ingredients was not what you would expect for a al carte . the drinks were the best part of the meal .
american	staff are inattentive and lack knowledge on how to wait tables . many staff are here to hang out with friends , or at least that is the appearance . btw , butter melts when the potato isnt cold . they got the bloomin ' onion down , but thats about it .
american	serving sizes are small , the soups are all extremely salty .. bacon strips in the sandwiches are paper thin .. and the prices are outrageous . i understand that this place is suppose to be healthy and does have healthy options which come at a premium price , but there 's a certain threshold where it goes from premium pricing to complete rip off . this place pulls out the rip off card . overall . meh . after two visits , i probably won 't return . i can 't see how this chain survives .
american	upon are arrival we were greeted with a friendly smile , and where told that we can sit our selfs any where we 'd like . once we sat our selfs we waited 10min ! ! ! for anyone to acknowledge we were their . we got the attention of one of the many servers , we asked for a menu 5 min after asking she brought the menu . after that we never saw her again bad service weak attention to customer service it 's very poor no floor manager presence , there 's no sense of leadership .
american	10 more minutes after just taking our order i finally got served the kids drink. the other tables being serviced by another server had drinks bread and refills by this time. the asshole server scoffed and said " wait a minute " when i asked if we could have bread . i immediately got up and left after telling the other server why i was leaving . i 'll never return to this location ! ! ! ! ! what an asshole !
american	it was sunday afternoon , no indians game , it wasn 't crowded there were open tables . we noticed other people were not getting service either . very disappointed as we were excited to try their burgers . i chose one star because it made me , obviously i would have chosen zero stars .
american	.. we will have to see how the rest of the service is , i will update after dinner . but right now , very poor customer service , lied to multiple times by hostess staff , and manager just hid in kitchen looking at a tablet ... not a good start !
american	another lady said she was me and was seated . when the hostess finally got back to me she realized what happened , never apologized and said there would be 1-2 tables ahead of us . after waiting another 25 minutes checked back with the hostess and said they were told we were sitting at the bar . we 've been standing there for 45 minutes and they kept looking at us . after telling them we were leaving they said they 'd put us back on the list and there 's only be 1-2 tables ahead of us . why wouldn 't you get us seated next ? we left and probably won 't be back . you need a better system for people waiting !
american	after waiting 20 mn without any consideration or water they said brunch is over i check online before coming here for the brunch ... poor service !
american	i have eaten at least 25 times at this location . anytime that i have ordered a steak , at least half the meat was fat . texas roadhouse used to be one of my favorite restaurant chains . not anymore ! hoping things would get better but only kidding myself . yesterday , i looked up the texas roadhouse hours to find that the rating on yelp for this restaurant was three stars . now i know why !
american	we ordered the mimosa flights which seemed to take forever and then were told they were out glasses because another party of 10 had taken them ( huh ? ) it was only 3 to our party . when our drinks finally arrived , the guy told us " sorry you guys don 't get them on a board , we 're out . " the food was mediocre to say the least . i will not be returning to this place . very disappointed .
american	almost $ 8 for a burger and fries portion size of extremely small burger
american	we left and went to i heart burger who substituted a side salad for the bread free of charge
american	imagine my disgust when i had driven across the city of pittsburgh for this famed menu item and didn 't get to taste it ! considering i don 't eat eggs or seafood , the only option left was french toast ... from a belguim place . good one .
american	we were the first table seated , coffee and water arrived 15 minutes after we were seated . our order required no cooking . no apology from the waiter . our meal was comped and we are taking it to the airport .
american	items where missing from my husbands salad and beyond that the level of service was just poor . there was maybe 4 other tables at the time and how could i forget the bird droppings on the table that the server never cleaned up , we ended up using our napkin . other than the view there is nothing special about this restaurant .
american	20 minutes later our plates arrived at the table .... cold steaks , cold mac n cheese , ice cold broccoli and cheese , dry & plain " loaded " baked potato . 3 cranky and hungry kids later . tempted to walk out but allowed manager to make it right . now our meals are coming out separately one at a time . so much for a family meal to celebrate a birthday . geez ! ! disappointed to say the least
american	2 salads and a burger took way too long . we asked for grilled onions instead of raw and got raw anyway . chicken on the salad was tough ( over microwaved ? ) we were told the kitchen is " really " busy . terrible excuse for bad service . they did take $ 2 off the burger but doesn 't make up for the experience .
american	definitely not worth the money and service was terrible as well . i waited about 30 minutes just to get a refill on my drink . 0 / 10 definitely wouldn 't recommend .
american	it was one of the new snazzy bills , all crisp and ready for circulation , but that is not good enough for cane 's . due to a rash of counterfeit $ 100.00 being funneled thru this location ( i doubt it ) my money was automatically suspect . the only thing suspect is this policy . the manager would rather lose a customer over this nonsense . counterfeits exist , but get over yourself cane 's .
american	all of the food was swimming in some kinda of sauce . the waitress kept forgetting to bring our drinks . it was so not worth $ 25 per person . i would have rather eaten a sandwich at the sandwich shop right across . do not go here .
american	it 's not a good sign when you order the lime steak with rice and salad & the rice is the star on your plate . the steak was dry and had a nice gristle line thru each piece . atmosphere was excellent and i do think they will get their act together . i agree with the other guy ... bge = burger . would also suggest char those peppers and onions . i am pulling for you as a local charcoal head but you have landed in a highly competitive culinary zone and it 's show time !
american	ordered our food right away , after 20 mins coffee still hadn 't arrived so we asked for our coffee , 10 more mins went by before we got our coffee . witness a server speaking rudely to a patron for asking a simple question . once the food finally arrived it was cold and tasteless . between the terrible food and lack of service i won 't be going back anytime soon .
american	the toast was burt , the hash browns on all three meals were burt and never got my water refilled. they took 20 percent off our meal but that didn 't help our experience . don 't expect much from any las vegas denny 's . they don 't have to have your return business more people will just take your place .
american	the waitress walked by is at least 10 times and never acknowledged that we were there . told the host and he reminded her she had another table and still did not wait on us . went to johnny rockets and had awesome burgers , awesome service and much cheaper ! ! !
american	waited 10-15 minutes and no one even acknowledged us , or looked at us let alone take our drink orders . terrible , absolutely terrible .
american	the butternut squash , back bean and corn soup tasted like what i assume it was : mixture of left overs . even worse were the fish tacos : cold , wet and soggy tortillas , oil-soaked sponges of dough surrounding bits of fish , and the soggiest , most insipid fries you can imagine ... truly disappointing ! ! !
american	the catfish was lukewarm and the sides were cold and had to be taken back to be re-heated . seriously ? ? ? ? my hubbie and i got sick with the big d and stomach pains , etc . the only thing we had in common on our orders was the catfish . both of us had to call out sick from work today because of the awful symptoms of food poisoning . have been so looking forward to this place opening ... the sides were good , though even though they had to be sent back the kitchen . will be calling them later today to inform them of the problem ... cross contamination ? ? ? undercooked fish ? who knows .
american	i literally had to track down the server and ask why after ordering our food an hour ago and seeing multiple tables come in after us and eat , we still did not have our food . the server assured us that it was being made now and would be at the table in 10 minutes . 15 minutes later , it finally arrived . not worth the wait . my date ordered the wrap and stated " it 's so moist on the bottom , i literally can 't pick it up . " my quesadilla wasn 't much better and lacked flavour . i can 't recommend this joint for brunch and i hope you 'll save yourself the disappointment .
american	i wanted to like it , i really did ... and perhaps with some edits we will be back ... oy beer on tap was old mecklenburg brewery ( omb ) . need more options need , much better options ... food was just ok , wanted a burger but they do t have fries ... really ? ordered the blt that was nothing special . fix the beer menu and the food , maybe you will get more folks in .
american	we honestly can 't rate the food because we were treated so horribly by the bartender ( i think he wasn 't keen on people eating dinner there and not just ordering alcohol ) . looked like a great buffett but waited much too long and was treated badly . too sad : - (
american	the place was completely packed . it looked like someone 's basement or garage with tables in it . various photos adorned the walls . i tried the world famous hot cakes . they were delicious , except i only ate 1 / 4 of them since there was a very long hair wrapped around the hot cake . pamela 's turned out to be a waste of money for me and i left hungry . there 's nothing that great about pamela 's . it 's like breakfast at most any other diner .
american	the beans were great ! the brisket was full of fat and tough to eat , even with the so-so bbq sauce . ribs were the same . how disappointing and a waste of $ 15.00 ! why do people think this is the best bbq ? if there wasn 't such a long wait , i 'd come back for the beans only . btw , it was nice to get a free bottled water while i waited in line . friendly staff .
american	sweet potato fries were good . service is good . but they only gave us lip service about salt in burger . rip off and way over rated . people are like deer in the headlights . way too enamored by fame of the owner .
american	the food was below sub par and no where near the price . the line for the " steak station " wrapped around the restaurant , all the wait for a razor thin , super fatty piece of prime rib . the sushi was chewy and not fresh . we thought the saving grace would be the desserts- not so . if you ever went to a sizzler in the 80 's- the dessert table was the same .
american	shortly after that , i watched a grandmother experience the same thing with her grandson .
american	blah food , blah service and it 's kind of pricey as well . i know that everything in vegas is expensive but -- $ 9 chicken fingers that come with nothing but ranch and 2 sticks of celery that tasted that they came from a frozen box from costo , puh-lease !
american	the large orange juice should have more water than orange . the ambiance is pretty busy so the waitress . hence , it is a whole mess without mention that the bill arrives just on time to kick us out and welcoming the new victim . the food was ... oh yes it was as bad as the service . probably it wasn 't my day and not even the sort of place i will repeat . pd : i am not a bacon person .... if you are not a bacon person don 't waist your time .. if you are ... check other reviews !
american	i 've been coming here for a couple years but i think i 've finally had enough . i doubt i 'll return . the food isn 't great , isn 't horrible but it 's close to home . the staff isn 't very swift and gets my order wrong as often as right . i 've had enough and will go somewhere else . as for the bobby sandwich that i 've heard so much about .... it 's bad . gummy stuffing , bland turkey and bad cranberry sauce . only someone who 's never had a good turkey dinner would think it in any way resembles thanksgiving dinner .
american	after waiting over an hour food and seeing other tables that got there after us getting there food had to complain to manger to get service the food cane out cold and over cooked not worth the money or hipe
american	there was no apology for the fact that we had to wait so long for our food . when we did " ask " our server for the reason we still didn 't have our food another server told us that everyone came in at once . for the type of food and service the bill was just too much . our server should have at least offred to comp our drinks . $ 10.50 for 3 pops . we will not be returning ! ! !
american	the family appeared to know each other . the hostess helping us said can you sit at this table located in bar . yes .. were cleaning it now.the aggressive family whispered to michelle who grabbed menus and sat them at our wsiting table although we had been wanting 15 minutes and same amount of people in our party . michelle was rude and the hostess told her they were her first .. she first walked the loud lady over came back and got the kids and the man went to sit down later .. when i brought this up oh sorry it will be a few more minutes .. we left we wont ever return.rude rude michelle practice what you preach on mlk day ..
american	within two minutes , i had my three piece white meat meal with mashed potatoes and green beans ( $ 8.19 ) , or so i thought . i arrived home only to discover instead of mashed potatoes , i was given coleslaw . i detest coleslaw ! ! ! i was planning on feeding the potatoes to my baby . thanks , kfc .
american	a suggestion , put a sign on the door to let your potential customers know that half the place is not available today , so we don 't stand around waiting to be seated while we watch the wait staff scurrying around waiting on others while we wait to be given the news of the unavailability of your restaurant today . thanks
american	waiter said they had 50 pizzas in front of ours . what was so frustrating was there were take-out orders being taken and filled prior to the people being served in the restaurant . i don 't care how good their pizza is poor management doesn 't make for good business .
american	unfortunately , it was just as bad the 2nd time . eventually someone did come around to serve us , although i 'm pretty sure our waitress was drunk . literally every ' empty ' table around us sat full of empty plates and beer glasses from previous customers that had left much earlier and remained in place during our hour and a half visit . poor service and bad show are a result of mismanagement . the place is a great concept with open space and activities ( volleyball , ping pong , grassy area , etc ... ) but it 's not just a park , it 's a place of business . it seems management has overlooked this area .
american	there were only 6 booths maybe , and a lot of tables ( not very cozy ) . when the waiter finally came over , he was very nice ; however we never saw him again until i flagged him down for the check . we started with the chicken nachos , which were decent because we were hungry . the entrees came before we even ate half of the appetizer . the country fried steak was tough and not very good . the sides were tiny and came in condiment size plastic cups . there is a $ 3 charge for sharing an entree ! i wouldn 't go back , nor could i recommend going there .
american	the was easy to get a table and our waiter was friendly and helpful . however , we soon noticed a sticky sauce stain at the edge of our table from some previous diner and also stained our clothes on it . i suppose the person cleaning the table could have missed the sauce stain as it blended with the dim lightning and was at the edge . we ordered the southwestern ( salad ) and the spaghetti pomodoro . while the salad was so large that it couldn 't be finished , the spaghetti was disappointingly small . it almost seemed as if there was only one and a half cups of cooked spaghetti on the large plate .
american	if any of your are expecting that , go instead to hash hog a go go inside the casino in lin q. the menu was limited , and i spent more time trying to figure out what looks like d-d-d food . i got a hamburger which in comparison to hash hog , was small . bottom line : over priced , over hyped .
american	so after telling a few others about how this place makes you walk on water we are seated by an un-happy waitress . we all joke " what 's # 1 if the burger is # 2 " only to be told # 1 is beer . we all order something different and decided to share for the experience . huge let down . i covered mine in hot sauce on the table and someone who ordered the fish couldn 't even finish half of it . pretty much zero taste and limp fries w no flavor also . after talking to " locals " they said the place is a tourist trap and they avoid it .
american	the manager tried to give me credit for the issue after i asked for a refund . he said he cannot give refund because they can get in trouble . he than states he has to call his gm to get approved when i told him there is no signs or anything on receipts states no refund . all of this happened after i received all 6 pizzas and wings came last with a horrible cross contamination .
american	five of us arrived and were asked if we had reservations . we did not but sure didn 't know why that was important when the entire place was empty . " spaghetti house " may have been added to the name but i don 't know why since there was not much in the way of pasta . prime rib sandwiches and tilapia which took forever to arrive were very lukewarm . the prime rib dinner was nothing special . i hope the folks who give this place 4 or 5 stars have the chance to eat elsewhere and find some really great food that deserve the high marks because this one does not ! what a disappoinment !
american	i am sorry but we will never return to this location , besides the chicago locations are way better than las vegas . very disappointed .
american	we ordered and our food was brought out to us to-go in a timely manner . we drove home and opened our burgers . i had ordered a mushroom and swiss burger with raw onion which we were also charged the extra charge for the add one . but sadly , what i got was a burger with only a little swiss cheese and onions . not only was i missing what i was charged for , this burger did not look appealing either . i drove back immediately and they were happy to refund me my money , which was nice . although this first experience was not the best , i would like to try them out again . hope next time is better .
american	we waited too long to get service , turned out 2 waitress quit on them , under staffed , many customers . food was edible but wasn 't great . i asked for scrambled eggs came as a half ass omelet . my daughters eggs had cheese . things weren 't correct . but they took my 20 % off coupon . not planning on returning .
american	never had an establishment take my card first before i ordered my food . wait staff got tables mixed up . i understand they just opened so i will go back in a couple months . i would have to assume their staff will be on point .
american	as he greeted us , he told us it would be a 35 minute wait for cocktails . we ordered a flatbread and 20 minutes later were told they were out of flatbread . i ordered a burger and asked them to add tomato . no tomato in the kitchen apparently . shrimp and grits half the portion size as last time . " they downsized the portion " the portions are tiny and the service poor .
american	i dont think they can do the math . they lost 30.00 + .... over a cup of coffee ! ! ! they should focus more on cleaning up the place , and custoner service ! i will stick to fern restaurant for a real vegan place !
american	we had to ask another waiter after 20 mins to get our drinks . we ordered our food and waited 45 mins ! the eggs were cold and hash browns not cooked . dana was our server and she was just terrible ! worst denny 's ever ! ! !
american	as always , the restaurant was quite busy and the atmosphere is nice . however , i found the menu to be smaller than what i remembered . i opted for the chicken madeira pasta but was quite disappointed . the pasta was mediocre and i was not a big fan of the sauce . it was too flavourful for my taste . the service was also very average . the only saving grace was the moxie 's white chocolate brownie which never fails to disappoint ! ! ! i don 't think i will be coming back to moxie 's anymore as other franchise chain restaurants have shown me better .
american	we tried lobster roll with classic english topping . well ..... sandwich was dry and portion was really small even for me . better go and get lobster at some real restaurant . criss cut fries was not impressive at all . this place has a great idea to bring lobster to kind of fast food but they need to improve their menu , quality and quantity because it doesn 't match the price you pay for it .
american	stopped in for brunch and started out with mimosas and bloody marys . bloody mary was amazing . ordered the chicken and waffles and the chicken avocado salad . the salad came out wilted and completely drenched in dressing . while the chicken was fantastic , the waffles tasted like cardboard and were hard as a rock . the 2 or 3 potatoes that were on the plate tasted like they were cooked in oil that wasn 't hot enough . the drinks were good , but we definitely won 't be coming back for food .
american	the 2 bartenders had little to no personality and were very standoffish . we had to ask to order food and after over 10 minutes of an empty glass we had to ask for refills and more beers . i would love to blame the service on how busy they were----but they were not busy . the food was good , and like i said i 've always been a fan of the beer . just had a lot higher of expectations .
american	people who were sitting even looked around for someone . the guy walked past the back servers door twice and looked our way but nothing to let us know someone or even him would be right with us .... the lady mopping the entry way even looked around ... needless to say the menus went back into the pile and we left .... went to denny 's instead excellent service and a great meal ! ! ! !
american	the last 5 visits have served me brisket that was so tough and full of gristle i couldn 't eat it . one time is a mistake or an isolated experience and i have come back hoping the quality would improve . i told the manager that the cutters could easily prevent this but they don 't . disappointing . there are too many other options , i won 't be back .
american	after years of clogging the arteries and shortening the lives of local patrons , kfc has closed their doors forever !
american	we order the same thing every time . the last few times the rough cut tomato salad is plain awful . the greek dill dressing makes the dish . they changed it . the last order we got had a strange gelatinous dressing that wreaked of garlic . this time it was a sweet watery dressing that had no oil in it . it was nasty to say the least . the ginger lime aid juice was obviously sweetened with something new . it was sickening sweet . the food has gone down hill . for years it was consistent , healthy and tasty . now , you never know what you are going to get next .
american	wow what a mistake . i guess the place was understaffed . totally understandable , however that doesn 't mean you have to be curt and rude to your customers . can 't say anything bad about the food , but usually if there 's bad service , expect the same from the back of the house as well as there is no accountability here for bad service ! we got up and left . no reason for bad service . you are in hospitality , if you don 't like your job , quit !
american	onion rings were prohibitively salty , and my squash ravioli was bland with hyper-salty leaks and burnt walnuts . the head chef came by to ask how things were , but after we let him know he didn 't feel the need to make anything right , just to talk to ' his guys ' . the place carries itself ( and charges like ) a nicer place in a big city , but the experience was anything but .
american	they will smell like b.o. , no joke . when a burger makes your hands smell like human body odor , it makes you wonder what exactly is in the meat ?
american	a long ( 65 minute wait ) left our family of five crammed into a 4 top . the benedicts were well cooked but simply not that tasty . for a family of 5 the bill was $ 100ish . could have gone to denny 's , village inn or egg i am and had a much better experience for a more reasonable price .
american	staff was very friendly & nice . great wings . lowbrow " cuisine " with a lot flavour ... based on my wife 's pulled pork sammy . that said , do not order the taco salad a shown in the photo in the previous post . it 's a monstrous disaster . just imagine how weird it would be to eat a tray of nachos that didn 't get put in an oven . cold hamburger , cheese and iceberg lettuce without a dressing . yes , " salad " without dressing and a bunch of crumbled cold hamburger on a bed of iceberg lettuce . wtf .
american	a fun place to meet friends but beware of the lackadaisical wait staff and the expensive wine leave a lot to be desired .
american	i still much prefer mcdonald 's across the way or burger king .
american	so , this time i got double cheese no mustard . i was in the outside lane , the inside lane , three cars to one on the outside . no wonder the order was wrong . unfortunately , start giving reading and comprehension tests and maybe a personality test , why double cheese ? can 't eat the horrible cheese . i call , they say sorry , we will put your name down for the next time . heavens , i have been going here so long i probably have at least two months of burgers for their errors . but they are close to my home .
american	the restaurant is beautiful , no doubt but the food ... ugh . the last time i came here i ordered a burger which made me sick ; this time i got the chicken bonfire . the chicken was nothing special , the red potatoes tasted bland , and the " crunchy slaw " was flat out gross . i can 't give it zero stars but i guess one star for the waffle fries . that 's the best thing they have to offer . boo !
american	however i am a little shocked zzaat za vooolfgang has putz his namen on zzees piece of scheiza .
american	why do i do this to myself ? i wanted a burger & sprite , my pregnant co-worker wanted a baked potato . no potatoes , whaat ? ! ? then no sprite ! ! ! they were missing 2 out of 3 items and there was no way in heck i was returning to work without that potato ! deny a pregnant girl her craving .. never ! so again i spent my lunch break driving to another wendy 's !
american	we ordered and dined in . this time i received my spaghetti promptly but we had to wait over 20 minutes for my husband 's meatball sub . i was finished with my spaghetti and even had to check on his order . the manager really needs to address problems like this . the young girls working said oh , sorry . it should be out soon . that 's it . i really like the spaghetti , pizza wings and sandwiches but their service is ridiculous .
american	not impressed . why am i brought back to places i don 't like ! another friend wanted to have bkfast here . cold tacos , bland flavorless , pancakes are heavy and too sweet . service felt like it was our bartenders first real job : ) had to ask for silverware , more coffee , more water , condiments etc . i 'll try not to come back ... just another chain .
american	obnoxious prices , same snotty waitstaff / arrogant mgmt & not so happy hr . lgno ps really well thought out name ? ! ? isn 't that what you do when you get home ...
american	not to worry went back to my favorite family restaurant shame on me for trying sunset pizza again . if you want to go to a awesome restaurant with fabulous food . message me ! ! ! !
american	nobody in our group was happy , the wings were terrible and fries greasy / soggy and cold. why bother having to ask for carrots and celery when they are served inedible , careful if you are sharing because you have to share your ranch or pony up more money for another portion . our server was nice but seemed nervous and jumpy . this remains my least favorite restaurant in the world ! ! ! !
american	it was a big mistake . the pepperoni tasted like it was old / expired . it was the most disgusting pizza i 've ever eaten . i 'm surprised they are still in business .
american	not the case . two thin , appetizer sized pieces veal and some third rate lasagna for almost $ 60 in a space that only poor people wont mind dining in . i thought the dessert menu would make up for this but boy was i wrong . about 6 underwhelming options from the " cake boss . " wtf ? i ordered two items that were as pathetic as the food . steer clear of this place .
american	i really should have listened to the reviews i read . there was only 1 person ahead of me ordering . still waited almost 10 minutes just to put my order in . about $ 8 for a decently large slice of pepperoni pizza , not too bad . they warm up the pizza once you order it . so it 's been sitting out there for god knows how long . my pizza came out with this burnt charcoal taste to it . gross . never again .
american	again , no idea who my server was . again really wanted to love this place but man , it 's just not going to happen . why , why for god 's sake can 't this wonderful location / menu / ambiance just deliver on it 's promise ? well , i 've given it all the tries i can give . will not bother again .
american	again this is only my second review that is not an absolute favor of the restaurant but i have to say i was a little better that my cheeseburger came with sweet pickles yuck i have never ever ever ordered a burger and had a come with sweet pickles the waiter did ask me if i wanted relish on my burger and i said yes unknowing that he was sweet relish with sweet pickles why would you do this to a great burger the only other travesty that they could 've done was to put miracle whip on it
american	wanted to grab one of the open tables . this time they said it was a 30 minute wait . there was absolutely no one waiting in line . this is cleveland folks . get the customer service right .
american	the entire dining room was open however we had a 10 min wait because we were only 2 and those were reserved for larger parties .... it always seems to be that when heather manages this takes place ... our server cathy left something to be desired .... thank god the food was good !
american	the " bruschetta " consisted of cold hothouse tomatoes that clearly had been in the fridge for a long time , and the crab cakes were cold in the middle , also indicating a casual attitude towards preparation . for the price , which was in the haute regions , i would have expected more attention to detail . i thought long and hard about giving them a single star , but it doesn 't quite reach my threshold of " i 'd rather starve to death than eat here again " for one star reviews . but close .
american	bun way bigger than the burger . too fat so it was burnt on the outside . too fancy for its own good . a real gut bomb . bread pudding was runny and burnt . waitress was nice .
american	came to gamble with my boyfriend and a friend . the rude bartender dude doesn 't give 1 crap . he is rude . when the machine wasn 't working he said well just guess it 's keno seriously dude he couldnt just calibrate it . we wanted some of their bomb wings but honestly the bs service is not even worth it .
american	tried both the chicken gyro which was quite dry and the jumbo gyro which was just not as good as others i 've had recently . wish they had fried mushrooms on the menu .
american	didn 't eat my meal . i don 't understand why it is getting high reviews . i couldn 't stand it . the appetizer was ehhh the salad was filet salad was gross the barbecue was unremarkable . i was expecting something much better .
american	just not that great . overpriced for the quality of the food , and somewhat incompetent wait staff . some serious bad management going on here . tried it twice , probably wont be back . much better options out there .
american	so overrated , not impressed with anything on the menu . and who has a secret menu that isn 't a secret at all .
american	crappy bun . sauce is good . a few pieces of pork tasted like paper had gotten into meat . the mac and cheese was crap , and so not worth 2.50 . my roommate loves bbq so the idea of rubbing this one in when i came home backfired . the take home message here is overpriced ! ! ! !
american	lousy lemonade didn 't care for the fries . colleague sent her burger it was way over cooked . they did offer to replace it it and took off the bill but not a place i 'd visit agains .
american	the restaurant is so massive that they can sit pretty well any size group anytime . also , they don 't ask you leave after you 're done , so you can keep on drinking . by no means is this a bad place , i just tend to gravitate towards places with really amazing food . l 'academie is reasonable food and a reasonable price , not some place i 'd go if i 'm looking for a special night out .
american	server got our order wrong , then brought us the wrong check , then dropped our credit card in the walkway and just kept on walking . if you just go to watch a movie , i imagine you 'd enjoy your experience . the seats are comfy and sight lines are good . but if i go there again , i won 't order anything .
american	the place had an average size crowd for a weekend , and our server was prompt and very nice . the food was just " meh . " nothing that dazzled and nothing that stood out . for the price , i should have had a lot more food on my plate , and served to look more appetizing than it did . i won 't be back .
american	he loves it . i have no idea why . limited menu , no healthy options and the food was not that great . i make better chicken tenders at home . your choices are deep fried chicken tenders or a deep fried chicken sandwich along with deep fried french fries . seeing a pattern here ? deep fried everything . no thank you . i can 't imagine why anyone would eat here . fast food doesn 't have to be unhealthy . we won 't be back .
american	this was one of the wors burgher experience i ever ate.i ordered a burgher with bakon and a cheeseburgher . it was too wet , the bun was like a wet napkin and it didn 't have any taste . both were a big dissapointment . the fries were over fried .
american	ordered teriyaki chicken wrap - doused in sauce ... not marinated . thanks for the liquid wrap . sub-par for food , but cold beer .
american	had omelette a couple times and it tasted like it was prepared days ago . very expensive for what you get . would way rather go to a family breakfast place .
american	a good place to have a couple of beers , but basically is just another hrc , nothing special about it .
american	i had the chicken , brie + fig sandwich , which was actually quite good but it was easily something i could make at home . i ordered the coconut cake for dessert , expecting a fluffy flour-based cake . however it was actually a tart made from shredded coconut . which would have been okay , had my tart not been overcooked and impossible to cut let alone eat .
american	insulted beyond belief today and near tears . cant shake the uncomfortable feeling i was left with . needless to say we got our drinks and left .
american	i ordered the avenue dip - braised short rib , provolone cheese , french roll and peppered gravy for dipping . it had a metric ton of cheese on it . the sandwich started falling apart as soon as i picked it up . and the gravy already had skin on it by the time it came to the table . the fries were flavorless . my girlfriend got an omelet and tipped her plate so at least six tablespoons of grease came running off into her napkin . despite the relative emptiness of the restaurant , our server was awol for most of our visit . avoid this dump at all costs .
american	cheese in omelet was like plastic and tasteless . everything was greasy and oily . the 2 stars are there for a lovely attentive waitress
american	i only went here once , but it was disappointing . the food was on par to ihop . i can 't tell you how many people get a omelette wrong . either the ingredients don 't gel right and is tasteless , or the egg is undercooked , etc . the omelette i got here was tasteless . the potato o ' brien was overcooked in too much oil to the point it was deflated and tasted more like leftovers . not a fan .
american	if you like buffets but want to diet this is your place because you can 't stomach a second trip to get food . all the meats and extras were cold . the selection slim . the desserts were hard , literally " clank clank " with your fork . i got excited for the ice cream until i bit into it and it tasted sour . poor quality and way over priced . in fact i can 't every remember eating worse food in my entire life . best advertised as the " worst buffet in the world . " don 't waste your money .
american	classic benedict was cold and flavorless . they forgot the waffle and when it came out late it was missing the fruit and whipped cream . the waitress brought out grapes instead of berries . no offer of a refill for our hot tea . just seems like a chain type of place where no one cares .
american	but having eaten here several times as well , the food is disappointing , and it 's not just me being picky . my work colleagues came up with the same complaints . the food is industrial grade for the most part ( with a couple minor exceptions ) . i don 't know what 's going on back in the kitchen but the results taste like no one cares . maybe two stars is harsh , but with everything it has going for it , it 's doubly annoying that against the grain doesn 't get it right .
american	shaina , or whatever her name is was one of the most rude servers i 've seen . a decent place marred by a terrible waitress . i gave two stars , because the food was pretty good at least . seriously though , shana ... find a job where you don 't have to deal with the public .
american	have visited the establishment on multiple occasions and have yet to have a successful meal . our most recent visit resulted in french toast with the toppings of little black hairs and rubbery sausage accompanied by a waitress who cared more to charge us for the meal and get new food rather than to apologize and remove that from the bill .
american	this is my fourth visit to this place and service is always on the slow side regardless on how busy the restaurant is . i have spotted an inappropriate act between the manager and the server ( the manager was yelling at poor guy using inappropriate words ) which is definitely unacceptable at any restaurant standards . the food on the other hand is amazing . but service ! ! come on ! ! staff isn 't that friendly or professional , the four or five servers we dealt with were all on the younger side of age , no experience what so ever .
american	the food was good when serviced correctly . ( in a party of 7 , one person got the wrong order and another only got half of her order ) . the waitress was short and not attentive . although the venue was nice , i would not return .
american	i 'm not a person with an immense appetite . the " big " upgrade creates a negligible difference . the namesake " smash " technique lends itself to a thin , dry , overseasoned burger . fries have been consistently bland , even compared to the fries of other establishments . customer service is good . i feel bad that the employees have to deal with this lackluster , corporate product . all aesthetic and no substance . do yourself a favor and go to in-n-out , across the street .
american	i 'm not sure if staff are told by management to be " skimpy " on the veggies , but they don 't put a lot on . then when you ask for more , i feel like it is a burden for them . plus i feel like their selection of $ 5 subs are less then other locations ( could be wrong because i haven 't eaten at a subway in a long time ) . all in all , customer service is lacking to save a little money .
american	sad to say but the grilled chicken sandwich is bad and management is even worse . the entire operation is a disaster . whoever hired these managers is not getting their money 's worth . no mayo or anything on the bland chicken sandwich .
american	sad . two young teenagers left there working alone . the guy seemed to know what he was doing , however the gal working with him was totally useless . she didn 't know the menu , didn 't know how to make a sub ( blt ) and clearly didn 't know how to use the cash register . and one large fly buzzing around the meat and cheese station . ugh . i 'm done .
american	i think the pancakes are made out of rubber found a hair in my french toast one time , no lie ! ! the only decent thing i 'll eat here is french fries ! you are better off going to the kfc across the street which i hate ! ! i hate kfc and i know it would be better ! ! change name to : steiner 's-a terrible service style pub ! !
american	agree with chris b ... " not what it used to be ... wings are still the best this side of buffalo , everything else used to be very good , but not last year or so ... fish fry used to be my favorite , last week it was terrible , as was coleslaw
american	i dug at my plate trying to find the perfect bite and it never happened . the " bbq sauce " rimming the plate was just plain nasty . where was the syrup to drown this crap in ? ? ? my friends , however , got an appetizer with steak that was like a normal-sized plate . if you 're staying near imperial and go to here , stick with the appetizers and don 't expect much ..... and you should be fine . ( i saw a burger go by and it looked good ... maybe split one with someone ? but i heard the 24 hour burger palace is better . )
american	i don 't expect much from chain shops , but what i do expect is they get our order right and treat me with respect . this spot earned its two stars for incorrectly placing our to-go order . it 's always sad to return home and find something missing ! otherwise , the employees did their best to take our order and be polite . the food we did receive tasted great and of course we 'll come back to einsteins again , just not this location !
american	the service was poor at the bar area and continued to decline in the dining room for the remainder of our dinner . we always love supporting local restaurants and do so frequently however we will never eat at this establishment again .
american	i ordered their special for the day , which was a $ 9 pierogi hoagie with potato pierogies , grilled onions , sour cream and bacon . i love pierogies ( especially when paired with bacon ! ) , but was pretty disappointed with the mediocrity of the sandwich . two things in particular made the sandwich mediocore : 1 ) lack of bacon - they use bacon bits but they are so small and can barely taste in the sandwich and 2 ) bread quality - tasted like a cheap costco hoagie roll . will try a different food truck next time .
american	we tried fast eddie 's for breakfast with a family member who was in town . service was ok . food was okay , but the pancakes definitely seemed like they were from a mix . i also think i had some sickness later due to the food , so that is definitely a mark against them . at least it was a decent value . all things considered , with all the other breakfast options in the area that i do like , i doubt that i 'll be back .
american	it 's a nice spot . however , i have had two meals here and both were unsatisfactory . the most recent was a grilled cheese sandwich and how that could be messed up i don 't know ; it was almost cold and hardly grilled . i will not be eating here again . such a shame because it is a nice spot .
american	we had 4 kids with us 3 of which got pizza . the wait was over 45 minutes . the pizza sauce was out of the refrigerator cold on the pizza , when we asked for the pizza to be heated up more the waitress was very rude . we then got charged for every meal when we were told kids are free on tuesdays . when we asked about our bill our waitress started in with attitude again , walking away before we had finished asking our questions . we asked for every single drink refill as well . do not waste your time !
american	actually the people eating were cheering us on and were glad to have some excitement in the bar ! it 's a shame that the management handled it the way they did , especially since the bride 2 be had her engagement party there . not sure why you would want to lose out on service . we are a group of classy girls and felt that the way we were treated was disrespectful . guess we will take our business elsewhere ! ! ! ! ! ! so if you are looking to go out with a group of people , don 't go to market garden ! ! !

american	i really want to like this place . the food was good . the service , however , was quite poor . the service was slow and disjointed and our waiter seemed unsure of everything he was doing .
american	our food took almost an hour . it was cold and lacking any kind of flavor . of course appetizers came after the entrees , also cold . while waiting on our food we basically had to yell just to talk to each other over the incredibly loud music . this place is too small for live music . more of a want to be upscale restaurant but can 't get away from reality of a sleezy night club . needs zero stars but review requires a star .
american	teriyaki flavor was good . 3 bbq plates and 2 chicken plates all were cold . we were so hungry only two got sent back . the hamburger was good and came out hot . second try on wings and they were cold too and my side of onion rings became a ring and a half . third try and still cold . they have serious kitchen issues . the manager tried to make it right and they were extremely nice and comp 'd the wings , the 2 plates we sent back and took half off the others . he did try and i 'll give them credit for that . the cold food is perplexing to me .
american	we were all pretty hungry and the place wasnt busy so we figured we would get our food in a timely manner . it took almost 2 hours after we ordered for the food to come out ! and on top of that , my friend and i ordered steak and they were not cooked the way we asked . it looked liked they served us a huge plate of fries with a small piece of extremely rare steak . i don 't know if the large amount of fries was to make up for the time it took but overall we all that it was terrible !
american	the service was painfully slow . we waited about 20 minutes after being seated to get our drinks / wine . another 15 minutes to order . another 40 minutes to get our entrees . the food was mostly flavorless . the fish and steak was overcooked . the bacon appetizer was good . the lobster mac and cheese was just ok . the only great part of the meal was the wine - a jordan cab . i would not recommend this restaurant . there are many better choices in las vegas .
american	many of the apps were way over priced for the portion . $ 18 dollars for 2 artichokes really ! ! i don 't care if you flew around the world and back again that cant be justified . i very surprised their aren 't more italians out there yelling wheres the food . taste on some thing was ok considering pricing . the only thing that was exceptional was the duck confit . it was very well portioned and perfectly cooked . unfortunately it was my buddies dish but was kind enough for me to try . service was pretty bad . she was too busy and couldn 't handle her section .
american	let 's start with the bad and then onto the good . bad : bitchy service in the bar area as we waited for our party , slow service at our table in taking our orders , over an hour to get our meals delivered , two entrees sent back and most parties disappointed in the taste of their food . good : a few servers were friendly and space is kind of cool in decor as it is a modern hunting lodge theme that we see in la quite often ( 7 grand ) . bottom line is the prices are outrageous for average steak house food . the menu reads somewhat inventive with flavorful combinations , however the execution is dismal .
american	we got the spinach artichoke dip , the cheese quesadilla , a chicken flatbread , and some drinks . the food was just alright and the drinks were not much better . also , being that it was a weekday , it wasn 't very busy but the server was not very attentive . we had to flag her down to order refills on drinks & more food . in fact , we probably would 've ordered more if she would 've come back around to properly take the orders . considering that there are other restaurants in the area that also offer happy hour deals , we probably won 't be back here anytime soon .
american	a great deal if everything is good including the service . on this evening the service was slow ... our dinner took 2 1 / 2 hours from start to finish . no bread for the first 30 minutes even after asking . requested the wedge salads be chopped before bringing out and they were not . my wife found a hair in the prime rib which ruined her evening . overall , a big disappointment but the desserts were excellent .
american	they told us to order in the next few minutes , which we did . however , our waiter elliot wasn 't very welcoming and actually a bit rude . everyone there seemed to be very annoyed with us although we didn 't order anything complicated and weren 't there very long . we went simply to grab some quick appetizers and were there no longer than 20 minutes from when we sat down to when we left . the service was awful but the food and drinks was overall good , we had a few orders of fries and chicken wings between our group .
american	the restaurant was half empty and we were seated at a comfy booth right away . unfortunately , service for our group was neglected and we waited twenty minutes for drinks . the $ 18 + burgers half of the table ordered were over cooked and my reuben ( i love reubens ! ) was overloaded and saturated with sauerkraut ; masking the flavor of the beautiful rye bread and shaved corned beef . this sandwich was incredibly inedible . the atmosphere was pleasant and it was unfortunate that our experience was unpleasant . i would not dine here again .
american	i 've given it several tries since then and it has not gotten any better . sat at counter this time and was all but ignored ... perhaps because she is the bartender too ... ordered florentine benedict , eggs way undercooked . i think i 'm done with this place .
american	service was on point but the majority of us thought the food was a joke . lobster rolls looked extremely appetizing .. but had little to no flavor . wings .. you can tell that these wings were definitely fried for way too long and have been sitting for a bit . flavor ? waaaay overly salty . everyone that ordered wings didn 't end up finishing them . sliders .. i 've had better from dennys unfortunately . this was a first at a gordon ramsay restauraunt and may honestly be a last .
american	a friend recommended this place due to being on food networks restaurant impossible with robert irvine . they unfortunately have not continued with his recipes because the food was awful and made me personally sick the entire night . about the buffet itself first there was no chicken , veal or eggplant parm there was only fried and bake cod that was greasy and dry . ziti ala vodka no regular pasta dish but another ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and they stated there sauce was very acidic . years ago they food was outstanding their parents or relatives must be highly disappointed in what has become of this place save your money ,
american	even the drinks took at least half an hour for it to arrive at our table . the only good time to go here is after 9 pm because the apps are half off ( but you have to buy a drink too ) . drinks are $ 2.89 which is expensive ... it 's just pop . my sister and i ordered 10 honey and garlic wings , 10 medium wings , and the loaded cheese fries . the wings were dry and the fries were not loaded with cheese . it was loaded more with sour cream instead . i never go to crabby joe 's unless my cousins invite me out . not my kinda place .
american	service was ok at best , i ordered a double burger and fries . fries were barely room temp and the burger was the same . food tasted very bland , meat on the burger was very low quality and had no flavor at all . fries were disgusting , and not fresh , they tasted as if you left mcdonald 's fries in your car for a day and tried to eat them . overall it 's just a shitty place .
american	the gyros are pathetic and nothing special for the price they charge there was hardly any meet . i think if you combined all of the meat from the 4 gyros you might have one descent size gyro . the meat wasn 't that great either . the humus was pure salt . i have had 10 times better and more food for half of what they charge for one simple gyro . one thing that was good was the chips and that is why it isn 't 1 star . their chips are pretty dam good .
american	we arrived 15 minutes early , ordered our food and sat for an hour and a half and never received our food . we had prior engagements and had to leave . we all paid our bills without ever having received our food . they packaged our food to go . other patrons of the restaurant came in after hour party , received their food and left before we were ready to leave . one of our party 's bill was $ 9.73 . she gave the waiter a $ 20 bill and he returned change of a $ 10 bill . i am only giving the blue adobe one-star because i can 't give them 0 .
american	we sat upstairs which is cozy and presents a dark , comfortable atmosphere where the bartender also serves the tables . at first , the bartender was quite attentive until a group of friends arrived to visit him . suddenly it was as if we did not exist . the service became so poor i am tempted to never go back . in my opinion , this organization gets zero stars for service . the two stars that i have presented are strictly because the happy hour food was decent . not great , but decent for the price .
american	i thought it was okay the first time , but after that , the food and service declined . the service was extremely slow , and there were errors on the checks . the breakfast was only so-so , and the toast was cold . i asked for home fries , but got hash browns . others in the party had the same problem . i won 't go back .
american	my mom ordered a medium well burger- it was rare- she didn 't even eat it and showed the waitress- my aunt ordered a lobster mac and cheese- it was cold . my daughter ordered a grilled cheese and fries that were also cold but she was so hungry she scarfed it down anyways- we told the waitress and she said oh i 'm sorry that never happens . kind of disappointed that nothing else was done about it . first time eating there and unfortunately probably won 't go back ! i can 't even imagine the food on a busy night ! cute atmosphere though
american	the staff was rude and horrible . the food was bland , the chicken and dumplings was dry and thick , the turkey and dressing was horrible . the gravy was full of eggs and disgusting . the best thing we ordered was a cheeseburger which was burnt . once our food was brought out , we never saw a waitress again . we will never go back .
american	the place was not busy at all but what do i expect for a tuesday night . the server was nice but was really slow . she even forgot a round we had ordered . the real disappointment was the food . we ordered wings and tenders typical bar food . the wing were small and overcooked . the tenders were as small as the wings and also overcooked . all which had no flavor . really , i have had better chicken at kfc and i hate that place . we would have said something to the server but she was hard to find . wouldn 't be returning to this bar .
american	we told our server we had a show and he still moved slow as molasas . the only good thing we had were the fire roasted olives . we expected more out of this place based on reviews and especially the price . brucshetta was medeocre and the pasta was not good at all .
american	i find this amazing considering it was the prime night of restaurant week , a friday night , and they were no longer honoring their advertised special meal . the food was average at best , portions were cheesecake factory ' esque , the charcuterie plate looked like someone dumped a pile of cold cuts right out of the package onto a cutting board , no care given to the presentation of food whatsoever . all in all it was a sad experience , wouldn 't recommend going .
american	the bartender told us to " deal with it " and we promptly left . they were under-staffed which is bizarre for happy hour , especially at a waterfront restaurant . the watershed next door is a much better option !
american	the wait was ridiculous and the food was pretty terrible . frankly , if you 're looking for good breakfast or brunch in the area , you 've got other options .
american	the service was bad , restrooms disgusting , didn 't recognize any of the staff and on top of all that my friend and i split a patty melt and got food poisoning . her husband called the owner / manager and he hung up on him . don 't know what is going on with this place but it was a place we really enjoyed and we will never go there again . stay away ! ! ! !
american	we first tried to order a margarita . .they were out of all flavors ... ordered wings and frys .. frys came out 20 minutes before wings .... asked for a knife they were out . ... ordered brownie was told they were out if ice cream .
american	third time experiencing the local spot - definitely the last time . first time was solo and they were very busy . decent burger . second time the server was glaring instead of waiting my table with company . definitely in a foul mood and visibly shown . third visit , today , incorrect orders . sarcasm when addressed . i 'm no fan and won 't need to go back here .
american	bad news for us , this said busboy 1 ) overhead us and 2 ) actually knew who frederick douglass was . oh , if looks could kill .... we never saw our drinks again after that . get a cheap grilled cheese or a maybe a burger , and get the hell out . open 24 hours .
american	no warning . no attention . the excuse : this chain 's kitchen is unable to serve individual customers and a large party simultaneously . so why are they in the restaurant business ?
american	great spot to watch a game or a fight ; they have plenty of tv everywhere and great drink specials . there food is pretty decent for a sports bar too . however i have never eaten at this one . the down fall for this location is the patio and how dark they keep it inside . i thought i was in a movie theater at one point . the patio needs some serious tlc . the table and chairs are years over due for a replacement and they chairs are flimsy and rock back and forth , and weren 't meant to do so . it 's not too bad , but i wouldn 't go out of my way to visit again .
american	lovely to look at , food divine . service ? ridiculously bad . reservations at 930 . get in , get seated . waiter disappears after leaving us with their malfunctioning tablet wine list . returns nearly twenty minutes later & is a bit annoyed that we haven 't chosen our wine . because its clearly our fault the tablet isn 't working . then he begins warning us ( four times total ) that " we 'll be closing soon . " again . food , magnificent . so so so good . but feeling directly pressured to hurry the heck up and get out after being abandoned by the waiter ... um no . we won 't go back .
american	charming both indoors and out . the place always looks empty because it is empty . the menu is limited and several items were not available . the salad with orange vinaigrette was excellent but the the beef burger was overcooked and the bun was not fresh.the bbq pull pork had a ration of sauce ( perhaps they were out of that as well ) and the pork was dry . service was good and wait staff was friendly .
american	they were found guilty of refilling expensive liquor brands with inferior substitutes then selling them to the public ( as if it were the more-expensive brands ) . you can find proof of the violation by going to the nc alcohol beverage control website , hover over , " legal , " then click on , " meeting reports . " look at the summary for august , 2017 . they were fined $ 3500 for the infraction . think about what that says .
american	i ordered a spicy chicken sandwich with no mayo and a medium fry with a side of bbq sauce. heres what i got a spicy chicken sandwich with tons of mayo and a broken bun because of all the disgusting white shit everywhere. a medium fry that was literally half full , honestly me saying it was half full was exaggerating , it was about a third full. and guess what no bbq sauce but an open ketchup packet that got everywhere . bravo ... bravo. and this is why i rarely eat fast food .
american	i would have given 1 star but the service was pretty good . the major issues however included : they were out of the pinot grigio and kambucha , the food was disgusting- cold mac and cheese , undercooked tater tots , the cheese on the mac and cheese was gritty , and the soft pretzel had the wrong kind of salt- they used regular table salt ! ! ! i 'm hoping these are just opening pains . good luck
american	hmmm chicken wasnt fully cooked and i didnt realize until my 2nd to last piece . coleslaw not good , green beans not good . just not good ! ! ! !
american	all the times i have to be in this miserable airport i 've seen this place , usually packed . i was able to sit down and try them out for breakfast last flight i took to boston . breakfast was awful . their ingredients are not fresh . i was pained while trying to finish my food . bloody mary horribly made . the decorations don 't make up for food quality . don 't kid yourselves . on another note ... it is airport food . i shouldn 't have expected any better .
american	sundays at the bar means being run out by the regulars and politely ignored by the bar staff in favor of said regulars . food is consistently good , just need to stick to the tables .
american	not once has anyone i have ever been with has ever had a good meal . this of course includes me . a lot of money for beyond bland . i will speak up if anyone ever trys to convince me to go again . i would rather jack in the box down the street . at least i can get yucky food for three dollars there .
american	the staff was nice and friendly , but not my favorite bbq . i prefer mine really lean and really slow smoked. all of ours was fatty and gooy . i can name a few other places ( all a bit of a drive ) that are way better bbq .
american	the service from our waitress was subpar and food was not worth the price . needless to say , this will be my last visit here and so should be yours !
american	while the dirty floors , tables , and walls are a nice touch to add a third world feel , i 'm pretty sure the health inspector wouldn 't appreciate the attempt . the hummus tastes like an old divorce and the tzaziki is runny and depressing . but at least the ac is broken and it 's hot and muggy , just like a summer day in the eastern mediterranean sea .
american	went here for dinner . their seafood selections are all terrible ( especially whatever they try to pass off as sushi ) and most of the desserts you should pass on . the prime rib was good , as were the mac & cheese varieties . maybe they are better suited for lunch , but their dinner options ensured i won 't be coming back any time soon .
american	angry lobster linguine - again , the sauce is good .. but pretty standard dish . also shared neptune pizza , tandoori halibut ... underwhelming . everything was borderline ok but nothing to write home about ... although it is a casual restaurant , service was unprofessional , the server acted like a joke the whole time and came to check up on us at least 5 times within 5 minutes -- rush to get off work ? ?
american	not impressed ! for real pit b.b.q is pretty easy to execute , this place didn 't do a very good job of that my first time there , and i have to say say it was just ok ! i bought 3 two meat dinners so my wife and i could try some variety . they should offer a 3 meat dinner , spicy sausage was not good , green beans were tastless ! okra was very good , portion size is horrible you can acually see them weighing the shredded meats and only 2 bones for a combo plate w / sausage and 2 vey small sides for almost $ 11 a rip off ! not a value for the quality
american	not the greatest and given the price , a significant disappointment . drinks were only ok ( need a bit heavier pour ) and the fish dish ( halibut undercooked then replaced by bland walleye ) lacked imagination and flavoring of the accompaniments . service reasonable .
american	a hole in the wall place that serves outrageously expensive flavor-deprived pizza with no drink refills
american	but that expansion should have warned us enough to try somewhere else . while the atmosphere and decor was phenomenal and fun , the food was not . i am becoming a chicken and waffles connoisseur as i travel , and these chicken and waffles should have been passed up . the waffles were flat and soggy , the chicken seemed to be microwaved , and not enough syrup was provided . i hardly use syrup so for me to be left wanting more was surprising . i did enjoy the taste of the waffles ... maybe a hint of cinnamon which is unusual but great , but neither my husband or myself finished our meals which is a big sign that something was sadly off .
american	we had just ordered . i wanted to eat slowly but had to ask for a knife and fork . they gave me this flimsy mini plastic set . we were done for quite a while and hung around for the free photo . it was 2 inches by 1.5 inches . ( you have got to be kidding ? ) they were willing to sell me a larger size . all this talk about wahlburgers being about friends and family and they are just another grifter on the strip .... and i had diarrhea the next day . what a joke .
american	now a last resort for heights diners with no better options . we used to frequent - but as food declined , service followed . most recently i called to place a takeout order and they said they were too busy to take any carry out orders . the attitude of the wait staff is what i would expect of royalty . i am sure the colony will continue to do well , because there just are not a lot of options and ch diners don 't know what good food tastes like .
american	the food here is bad , and the restaurant is full of societal dregs . you will see children of low income families dip their fingers into the chocolate fountain , run around crying , bump into your food , and yell constantly . simply put , do not eat here unless you are under the influence of a drug / alcohol , as the experience will be horrible .
american	it has some promise because the food is quite good , but it seems to have contented itself with catering to the retirees who can get to dinner and be home by 6pm on a weekday . which is fine , because that is the neighborhood they are in .
american	dinner consisted of a flatiron steak ordered medium rare that leaned more towards medium than rare . the fries were a bit too salty and i came away feeling greasy and unsatisfied . i just wasn 't impressed . for the quality of food , i begrudge the dollars parted with for this so-so meal . there are prix fixe menu items for $ 25 that provides more value , however , i would be loathed to add on to a main meal that based on my experience would be unsatisfactory . the $ 7 cineplex movie ticket deal ( tickets can be used at all cineplex theatres , not just the varsity upstairs ) seems to be popular with diners .
american	paid $ 100 for the worst benedict and a miserable salad bar . will not be returning !
american	way over priced , with the smallest portions . ambiance and the drink list are ok . however , can not make up for the price . yelp reviews are over shooting .
american	listening to the gazette food critic brag about this place , i wanted to try.it 's supposed to be pizza neapolitan style i have been to napoli i know what it is , this place doesn 't even come close , tasteless ingredients plenty of tasteless dough the worst cesar salad ever .
american	the host guy was funny to watch , but not at all effective in getting tables turned and seated , and seems to believe his low level job gives him a pass to be rude to customers . i 'm fairly sure they intentionally stretch out the wait to create a false sense of demand and hype . there were always 3-4 empty tables while cranky people waited as if at the dmv . the food is fine , service is a bit awkward and certainly nothing worth putting up with their complete lack of urgency . it makes customers upset to feel like there 's no priority in taking care of them . hospitality 101 failure .
american	wanted to love this place but my meal was really horrible . rubbery roasted chicken breast : ( . the two stars are for the market , which is actually great and fairly priced . the herb box restaurant was very slow on service ( even though it wasn 't busy ... telling tale for 7pm on a friday ) and ridiculously over priced . we won 't be back .
american	welcome to my service full of fail poop list . while the food here is tasty , the service leaves much to be desired . there 's simply no good reason to have people wait when there party is only one short and half the tables are empty . nope . no . oh hell no . so if you want a burger downtown try big grove , distihl , or even guido 's ( the service is only marginally better than farron 's ) . if you want the best burgers for your buck though try jurassic burger in campus town . word to the wise , # servicematters
american	my first red robin gourmet burger . solo lunch on a friday . i ordered the bacon avacado burger , bunless with steamed broccoli on the side . my anticipation growing . first bite , dry , well done . i thought i ordered " as rare as possible . " avacado ? nope . some tasteless guacamole that likely came from a can . at least the bacon was good ...... but $ 12 for this ? first impression was not good . i 've been told its good , maybe they will get a second chance .
american	whenever i start wondering what it is i don 't like about chain restaurants , i can always find a joe 's or other current-or-former landry 's restaurant to remind me why . bland , tasteless , overpriced , swill .
american	a place like this you expect microwave bacon on your bacon burger . my beef ( no pun intended ) was the lack of friendliness from the bartender who actually made me uncomfortable . i think it 's safe to say he does not love his job .
american	waited an hour in line for this nasty ass sage chicken and waffles covered in some smelly ass rosemary . worst food i ever had ! ! ! roscoe 's is way better than this junk ! what a dissapointment ! !
american	fries were flat and without substance , burger was underdone and tasteless . if you want a patty from costco that 's underdone with some fru fru schmutz on it , give it a try . carl 's junior is better ... i don 't get how people are 5 staring this ...
american	they have you captive . if you don 't want food court fare , you can cool your heels at some place a little more chi-chi . the decor and menu here appear better than what the actual offerings are . fortunately i 've found another place i truly enjoy in the hub that is the phoenix airport , so i won 't have to bother with cowboy ciao again . don 't get me wrong , the food wasn 't particularly bad . but it didn 't merit the cash we splashed out .
american	this place is just a notch below that . beer selection is lacking and food wasn 't appetizing .
american	after the server finished her cell phone call in the back room , i was treated to a slice of pepperoni pizza who 's crust was almost indistinguishable from the paper plate it was served on . that and a domestic draft ran me about $ 8.50 . shoulda just gone with two brews .
american	the ribs were dry and really liked to stay on the bone . chicken was dry , i needed to have a few bites of my corn to go along with my chicken . the brisket and pulled pork were a little better . the bread was hard . it looked good when they were on the cutting board . each time a meat was taken out of the food warmer , it was still steaming .
american	manager acted annoyed that we asked to speak with her and then made a snide comment that our conversation was inconveniencing her . server offered free app , but never brought it . we asked for food boxes , came out on plates and had to go back to be boxed . overall crappy experience .
american	airport food so was not expecting much .... salad tasted funny ..... not sure what it was but maybe the lettuce was dirty ..... got the filet with no sauces but man was it plain .... no flavor whatsoever which is surprising considering this is a so called steakhouse ..... mashed potatoes were ok and plenty but seemed to be missing the cheddar .... presentation was simply potatoes plopped on a plate with a steak next to it .... no effort or care obviously ... ok for a quick bite before a flight if you do not want fast food but not sure i would go back ...
american	they were out of chicken sandwiches , so i got a burger and fries . everything was pretty good except they use the tiniest little burger patties . you 'd need a double stack to almost get a normal amount of beef . the fries come out fresh . crispy . they 're french fries .
american	10 minute wait just to be seated , when the restaurant is 1 / 4 full . 10 minute wait to be served , at the bar . 20 minute wait until the food came , right as i decided it had taken too long and i had to board my flight . absolute garbage . never again .
american	nearly everything is made offsite , including the sandwiches , which makes customizing ( say , for food allergies ) very difficult . despite this , they do great business since they 're literally the only place to get food in this building . the salads are fine , but i have yet to try any main as they generally all have dairy in them . i had a soup once and it was really watery . prices are kind of high for the quality / quantity . personally , this is an emergency / crappy weather level place for me .
american	this place is awful . had a great beer though . but in an hour 15 min got one beer . i guess they saved me some money !
american	wings 1 lb ? need to look up how many wingetts should be in pound . asked for dry but got with sauce on . too messy to take on plane will stress this next time if i return-not likely . even with sauce too dry . had side of broccoli perfect .
american	needed to eat fast before class and i owed my bf money so ended up ordering around $ 23 ... stopped myself before i ordered dessert ! we got a big crunch combo , cole slaw , small gravy , 5 hot wings , 2 beef taco combo with supreme fries ... ( yes , almost everyday is cheat day ) wings were not crunchy or hot soft tacos were average supreme fries were soggy but the gravy was delicious as a dip to all the bad quality food . service was good though . when you go just pray you get a freshly fried batch of fries and wings .
american	thin little fries that must be consumed immediately as they quickly lose heat . milkshakes were alright but but i was fiending anyway , so i wasn 't as discerning about it . hype unsubstantiated .
american	burgers are great , salads decent , fried macaroni croquettes deadly for the diet , but watch the fried pickles ... uggh ..... they did not agree with me . i had not visited the penguin in three or four years and the staff - whose wild sideburns and tattoos were so integral to the fun of this iconic restaurant - have apparently left under the new management . still , if you 've never been , plan to visit some of the nearby businesses in this neat little neighborhood just off central avenue as it leaves uptown .
american	the decour is nice . our waitress was not very good . she was rude and ignored us most of the night . the food was okay . small portions . honestly i could have went to apple bee 's for what they offered . very limited menu its 2014 every restaurant should have a turkey or veggie burger option . i wanted to try the crème brulé but did not want to spend another second there
american	it took us an hour and a half to get our meals in the downstairs small dining room . the server was slow with beverage , some of the food was only fair , and none of will go back again unless we can eat upstairs and be with only a few people . probably none of us will go back anyway .
american	" the owner came over only to blatantly refuse to take responsibility for the misrepresentation on his restaurant 's part and rudely interrupt our attempt to resolve the issue with , " i own other restaurants . " i have never seen such a mistreatment--not even in the snobby town of scottsdale ( no offense , people of scottsdale ) . it was unfortunate , because the waitress ( whose section we were sitting while making plans to move our night ) was sweet .
american	the restaurant itself was nice as was the service . we ordered a number of things including three different salads , a bruschetta appetizer and three different pizzas . the salads and appetizer were solid . the pizza was a letdown . the dough was very flimsy and seemingly undercooked . the toppings were okay but the pizza itself was almost room temperature . if we ever return we will be sure to ask for the pizza to be cooked well done .
american	i ordered an adult beverage and it was watered down and straight juice . i ordered one of their patron drinks , patron is not a subtle alcohol you 'll definitely always taste it . i let my waiter know this and instead of just taking the drink back to the bar and letting them fix it . he said he would let the manager know , which would have been fine except a manager never came . they didn 't offer to fix my drink or remedy the situation in any way . extremely disappointed and will never come here for drinks again .
american	our server didn 't get our orders right . they were out of ice and spinach for the pizza . it took forever to get our food . haven 't been there in 3 years and i can wait another 3 years to go back . it was not a pleasant dining experience . the server definitely needs some training .
american	we have been there on past thanksgivings and were pleased with the food quality and variety . not this year . no boiled shrimp , no full roasted turkey only turkey breast . the sweet potato pie and eggnog cheesecake were tasteless . the orange duck was very tough . service was good , but did not compensate for the poor food . way overpriced for what we received .
american	the pulled pork sandwich didn 't come with everything the menu described , the burger was dry , and the chicken nachos were fine but difficult to mess up . this is really the only place for a ' sit-down dining ' experience at the whitewater center , but most of us don 't come for that so don 't expect much if you have to eat there . i feel bad for the server as it wasn 't his fault , and he did keep apologizing . for them , it was easier to keep bringing us our beers and hope we forget about the food quality .
american	instead of owning it or offering to try to make it right , she made more excuses . i can only wonder where her managers got the idea that it 's ok to lie to patrons and ignore their concerns .
american	we suggest skipping the guacamole as they no longer make it fresh , comes from a bag and tastes like chemicals . hamburger was ordered medium-well and arrived just about rare . alecia did all she could to make it right . i guess the kitchen was having an off night .
american	public service announcement they will be shut down . food made me throw up violently . then i was denied a refund bc i couldn 't find my receipt amongst the throw up . customer service is always creepy . i would warn african people and ppl of african decent not to eat here . even though the business is black american owned . they do not cater to their own folks . just expect the worse treatment , dirty food , & slave mentality . a great alternative would be the new rest cherry tree house bbq nearby . way better food . this is a public service announcement- avoid- registered nurse
american	the food here has made me sick with food poisoning twice now. the second time 06 / 30 / 14 i had to go to the st josephs emergency room. bad creepy attitude from the night employee courtney or casey. i believe she tampered with my food. the manager dave is an absolute disgusting human being. noone willingly apologized , very reluctant to give refund. i do not recommend to anyone ! ! ! ! - registered nurse
american	my husband and his friend had a foot long chili dog yesterday and both of them got sick . my husband had a somach pain and nausea all night , he couldn 't sleep at all . i 'm not sure the food was old or it 's a food poisoning . hope he will feel better soon but today is a super bowl night .
american	burgers are portioned and shaped to look exactly like a frozen patty . also no rare-well done option . can only pick pink or no pink ? ! ? ! is this a restaurant or fast food joint . also don 't ask for any extra cheese ..... they are out of 8 of the 10 . order drinks over the phone before you arrive .... 15mins for a draft beer 20 + mins for cocktail . also watch out if you wear flip flops or open toe shoes .... utensils and huge pieces of food under the table . stepped on a steak knife when i slid into the booth . waitress was a sweetheart wasn 't her fault the restaurant is poorly managed .
american	stay away from this restaurant on crowded days . orders came out wrong and took over an hour on mother 's day . this location can 't handle a large crowd for simple brunch food . when the wrong food came out , it was sent back and returned to us with a crab cake tossed onto the plate . it was obvious they hadn 't cooked new food because they aren 't capable of getting food out in 3 minutes . the crab cakes look like a sad pile of crab and filler . what a shame that an experience like this makes me want to stay away for good . the manager here should be fired for incompetence .
american	this is not my first time at this steakhouse ( and i really hope not my last ) . the service was slow . the server forgot to bring our salads until our dinners were already on the table . the sauteed mushrooms were sauteed in too much butter . i also have a t pet peeve for specials that are no different ( even in price ) then the menu . the server was missing for much of the meal ( it was not that busy ) , but when it came time to pick up the check and the tip she was like a vulture . i would like to give it another shot ... as prior experiences had been great .
american	the food was great quality and fresh . i enjoyed a routine apple and kips fried chicken salad . yummy ! waited maybe 15 minutes for my food . the only issue was the 4 jack-wagons at the golden tee game that were screaming , cursing and being the fools of the bar and scaring many patrons off with their behavior . management kept letting them continued to be served at the expense of the bartenders and service personal because they were afraid of confirmation . the manager should be fired ! ! ! i personally saw 4 couples leave making reference to the noise and childish behavior .
american	the food was just alright . the seasoning was good , and the chicken nugget meals that our kids had were good . the crab legs were where it went wrong . we had 2lbs of snow crab legs , but when we cracked the first few open there was so little meat that we didn 't actually have anything to remove from the shell . i actually took photos of the lack of crab meat in the crab legs because i have never seen anything like it . alexis made the experience better by being great , we just wish the food had been on point . we will stick with the angry crab from now on .
american	i came in with my family to eat since we heard it was a great place ! ! they told us the wait was 40 minutes well the 40 min pass by and i ask how long more and they were not even aware i was waiting for a table so they play off and they said 20 more min . i talked to the manager and he gave me attitude , roll his eyes and keeped giving dirty looks i was surprised how a prestigious restaurant can have some one so ghetto as a manager !
american	i asked servers for water once i finally got seated and they responded with " i 'm not your server . " really ? ! give me a damn water lmao ! i ordered a coffee and never received it . but the food was good , aside from being room temperature lol .
american	place is nearly always packed and typically difficult to get good service at the bar . maybe one more bartender would help this problem out . i have been here more than once and will go back as it is close to home .
american	would consider coming back in a few months to see if the service has improved . if you 're a group of more than 2 , don 't be convinced to sit in the bar area - the tables are too small for three table settings . good milk buns ! i believe an ode to the kind at omg baked goodness .
american	could modernize their menu . waited in long line though there was plenty of room at the counter . no menus . no silverware too expensive and no sides . everything is extra . weird .
american	came to grab just a small snack before a big dinner . dad ordered some wings , mom ordered fries , and i ordered this asian salad with noodles . my mom 's fries were really warm , actually a little gross warm , and when we called over the waiter , before even saying anything , he says , " are the fries warm ? let me go get you another batch . " o.o if you knew the fries were going to be warm , why would you serve them ! lol . my salad was actually not bad at all . it was more of a cold noodle dish than anything .
american	tried it when it first opened , but thought it was just opening jitters . been open for a while now , and it didn 't get any better . our waiter had zero personality , seemed completely unhappy to be there . glass of wine took 10 min to get to the table , and they weren 't that busy . food was average , had the spicy sausage . sausage was good , but sauce and pasta was bland at best . pricing was fair , but seems a bit high for essentially fast food served in a nice bowl .
american	a real nice facility , great patio , nice bar but subpar food service . appetizer was late arriving and was lukewarm at best . loaded tots should be hot . then 2 of 3 dinners came about 1 minute later . fish and chips and salmon burger , tasted ok , but both were barely warm . third dinner took about 10 more minutes ( cubano ) , and while it tasted good , was also just lukewarm . hot food please .
american	wanted real food but they are breakfast only until it runs out . how weird is that ? they are also out of tea and it 's not even noon .
american	we waited to be seated by a host for quite a while . when we were finally seated our waitress didn 't know how to answer our questions about the menu . we ordered the potato skins , which i would highly recommend . they are home make and hands down the best part of our experience . i ordered the chicken fried steak expecting it to be homemade , but to my disappointment it came from a box and so did the gravy . overall , the service was not great , the food was bland , it took quite some time to get our check , and the environment was mediocre .
american	i purchased combo meal and asked for a strawberry soda and got a fruit punch instead . i didn 't realize the mistake until i left and i was in no mood to go back . and my chicken sandwich was piled with mayo do better !
american	not a home cooked breakfast ! hormel pre-cooked bacon ! not fresh bacon ! orange juice was gross ! orange juice taste like it came out of the can ! hashbrowns have a fake buttery taste ! yuck ! will not be back !
american	kfc , a & w , mr. sub and new york fries - boring ! they did open a new indian restaurant that looks good but i didn 't try it yet . they are also opening a harvey 's ( i do hove a harvey 's burger ) and a wrap place shortly . the place looks better than the old food court but feels a little cold .
american	was totally looking forward to my burger and bummed to find out that they had forgotten to put the blue cheese that i had paid extra for on it . not even a speckle of moldy cheese after paying damn near $ 17 for a burger , fries , and soft drink . next time i 'll hit in n out right next door and pay about a third of the price for a meal that never disappoints .
american	we called ahead of time to confirm reservations and vegan friendly meals . when we arrive the waitress had no idea if they even served vegan and gluten free options . she basically blew us off and since my mom has celiac it was pertinent we had celiac friendly meals . the chef has posted all over social media that this place is friendly . the end of it all we left very disappointed .
american	fresh , but not as flavorful as i had hoped . crust was well cooked , but a bit chewy , and a little bland . the sauce was just ok as well - slightly spicy , not sweet . the pepperoni was definitely the highlight . mixed results from the rest of the family . my parents both ate less than their normal pizza intake , while my sister and niece both really liked it ( although they are the ones that recommended it ! )
american	the place looked swankier than the food delivered on . definitely overpriced for the quality of the meal - i 'd just hit up the sbarro 's down the hall and probably walk away happier . one of the more disappointing restaurants in the monte carlo
american	i did order take out for both a burger and an order of 30 wings , but still just didn 't see the price of what i paid match the taste and quality of what i consumed . i am picky about my burgers , but the bun was dry , the fries were average and a bit cold . i only live 5 minutes from the business so shouldn 't have had to bite into a dry waffle frie . the upside was the woman who took my order , upbeat and definitely tried her best to suggest the best things on the menu . tipped good , but obviously that was for the service , not the flavor i was hoping to get . meh ...
american	i ordered a mcgriddle breakfast meal and headed to work . i sit down to eat and i have a sausage mcmuffin . a $ 1 sandwich instead of the $ 5.00 meal i just bought . i 'll never come back here . they haven 't even answered the phone to correct their mistake . terrible service . i shouldn 't have to tear my whole bag apart before leaving in order to ensure order accuracy .
american	add ins are a buck more so if you add cheese and bacon onto your burger , you already have a burger that is about $ 10 . their is really nothing special about these burgers other than the name . with all the different flavors and foods that they serve in las vegas , save your money and try something exotic .
american	my in house burger patty was very salty and my chocolate milk tasted like powder . service was friendly but food took 25 min for lunch . not terrible , but there are much better places in the area for less $ .
american	everything is pricey , but that 's what you pay when you need something quick and not too far . i usually get the rotisserie chicken or the hot wings there . the rotisserie chicken can sometimes be too salty , just depends which cook is cooking that day . the hot wings are decent , falls right off the bone , but could use more flavors .
american	this is after i had to send back first time being ice cold , 2 days in a row . i send back my bacon cheese burger after requesting my bacon crispy to avoid limp grease pieces of bacon . i had to return the burger and it came back in perfect tasty condition the second time . a bit of training in the kitchen by the food service / kitchen manager is in order at this location ! junior the manager was very apologetic and emma at the bar was wonderful .
american	the kabobs were over cooked and dry . when i told the manager , he simply made excuses that it was just the recipe .. i won 't be back ..
american	drinks were good . over priced , but good . service was poor . took 20 minutes for a drink at the bar . then another 20 minutes to other food . burger wasn 't even all that good . giving 2 stars because i liked my pineapple drink . won 't be returning .
american	a little overpriced and the food wasn 't that good. ordered venison , my partner ordered the fish du jour. fish was good , sides that it came from tasted like it came out of a freezer bag from the grocery. my venison was way overdone. the scallopped sweet potato was nice , but not with the 25 $ plate. it 's not incredibly overpriced , but the food was definitely something of he mediocre type that i could have made with my mediocre cooking skills. again , disappointed by the overrated king west row of restaurants .
american	a little past it 's prime it seems sad i think that i 've had my last meal here too noisy and not worth it in the food department some people seem to disagree with my review but this was my experience and perhaps yours will be different but please refrain from the insulting language - life 's too short to call people names over a review on yelp !
american	i noticed more of an older crowd which was a bit weird . highlights include outdoor heated areas for smokers
american	convenient since it was located in the linq hotel i stayed at . service was slow and appetizer came out with our meals . we had the chicken lettuce wraps , turkey burger and monte que . food was tasty , but two stars due to service .
american	no burnt egg mcmuffin here and the coffee was the usual " mcdonald 's hot . " the hash browns were underdone .
american	it took 10 minutes to be greeted and get a drink . then when i order , i ask for a " starting salad " before my food came out .... to my surprise my food came before my salad and i sent the salad back . somehow i knew it was going to happen and it did . i guess starting salad didn 't ring a bell . no sorry or anything when my original waitress came back . if you love bad service , come to ale house in concord nc .
american	food was great . good sized portions . pretty noisy . my waitress was falling out of her clothes ( not worth the view ) .
american	i was expecting strips of meat but got mushed or clumpy meat instead , and i thought there was not enough meat on such a big bread . the coleslaw was bland and dry . overall the taste was just ok . the people who gave good reviews obviously have not been to rd 's in brampton . do yourselves a favor and try rd 's and come back here and rewrite your reviews .
american	i had a build your own chicken sandwich . the bun was soggy , the avocadoes were brown , the onions were unrecognizable and it had a strange perfumey taste . fries were super salty and i usually love salt . asked for a side of ranch and got a tiny little cup and was charged $ 1 for it . really ? everyone else hated their food and 2 out of the 4 of us got sick off of it . never again !
american	i agree with another poster that the bread and a salad or app might be the best options breautiful retaurant and friendly staff but incredibly unheathful food .
american	no thank you . that 's too much for a lunch break , for me . if it had tasted exceptionally well , then maybe , but it was just a burger . i ordered blue cheese on the side and it want brought out . you order at the counter and they ask you to tip ... get you own soda . sorry , no tip . it 's was just " meh . "
american	it was 88 ° outside and 90 ° inside . took some time for server to ask what we wanted to drink . hardly saw server while dining and didn 't get a drink refill until five minutes before we left . asked for the check , that was another 15 minutes . server said i could substitute a salad for fries , ended up charging me for it and when i questioned it , he apologized and said he should have told me . son 's chicken looked like it came frozen from sam 's ( $ 11 ) and the food is way to expensive for the quality you get .
american	the people who go here clearly do not have a taste for good food . it 's a jumbled mess of bad service , large menus and cold food . about the only positive is the patio which there are few of around .
american	we went on a sunday afternoon and it was not busy at all . slowest service i have ever had . the server was alright the few times we saw him . the food was absolutely horrendous . we had to send back the spinach dip because it was so salty . our entrees were just as awful . will never return . don 't waste your money here when there are a lot of great options in surprise .
american	we had an indoor creek side table which was quaint . the rest of the indoor tables would be no different than any other restaurant . the service was friendly . three meals and the only flavor to any of them was the caesar side salads and sangria . $ 60 for two adults and 1 child was not worth it . even the bread was bland . very disappointed .
american	the wait was ridiculous when they had plenty of open tables , the service was terrible the waitress only came to our table to take our order ( once we asked her to take our order ) , and the food was not good for the price . would not recommend .
american	burger cold and red in middle . they offered to " put it back on . " forget it , not worth the wait and tater tots ( only + in dining experience ) would get cold . food was less than mediocre but the rude waitress guaranteed the single star .
american	all buffalo wild wings have poor to bad service but this one screws up every order and takes forever .
american	the burgers are so bland and small . the shakes taste like all cheap fast food shakes and the fries , yes they are fresh potatoes but the texture makes them seem fake and they don 't have any flavor . the menu is horrible and only has like 3 items on it . i understand that californians love it because they grew up on it , but i can 't understand the rage in other states . i keep trying to like them because they are really good to their employees , but i really dislike the food .
american	server was slow in coming and taking our orders . it was busy , but she could have at least acknowledge our existence . service could be lots better , especially considering the prices . most likely won 't be back .
american	pulled up and was told i could have anything else on the menu but the " grill " is turned off now . weird because burger are supposed to be made on a grill ...... yeah . pet peeve of mine is when stores close before they are actually suppose to close .
american	this place has so much potential but a huge lack of ownership . disappointing to say the least
american	i recently dined there with a group of friends and colleagues over labor day weekend . we were rushed from our table by their vulgar manager joel . he verbally attacked my overweight friend and was abusive to our entire group . his behavior was an embarrassment to the entire wynn organization . do your group a favor and eat elsewhere .
american	food came out with onions . waited 15 minutes for drinks . no apology from the server . and she charged us for a side of mushrooms ... which we never ordered nor did we receive . manager said she could " look into it , " but we had a flight to catch . i suggest waiting in line for any other restaurant before getting sat here right away ... chances are you 'll wait the same amount anyway .
american	what was missing like traditional bbq , was the smoke flavor . meats were boiled cooked , and grilled on a stove , rather than a wood , or charcoal grill . it 's definitely no authentic bbq .
american	poorly trained staff , mediocre food , adjacent tables not bussed , over cooked and unremarkable burger .
american	really bad service . as when we order a chowder and it wasn 't been place in and when we ask server that bring up food , he gave me a really bad attitude and ask if we want cup or bowl . totally not worth of second try . shrimp for linguine was so tiny , way smaller than other red lobster store . when my friend placed a order and want to change the something add in within 5 minutes she refused to change the order for my friends and said " i already place the order i can 't make any change for you . " i won 't ever come back again . if i can rate yelp with 0 i will .
american	all food comes from california pizza kitchen .. why is it called a " taste " of carolina ?
american	fist off no tables for 5 or more people so our group of 5 was split . 5 orders 1 right and the other 4 were never corrected only a casual sorry was offered . i had the classic 2 eggs grits and sausage . the grits were cold , lumpy and watery . as a true southerner i knew them for what they were right away . they had been setting for a long time and someone tried to add some water but they added cold water and did not stir it in . i spent the rest of the night in the bathroom so enough said .
american	all food was cold. ordered an omelet tell. with an english muffin. both were disgusting cold. bacon was undercooked , eggs were at an unsafe temperature. also i was told that there was no flavored coffee creamer and there is in fact a flavored coffee on the menu. terrible service. even worse food
american	i hope this saves any unnecessary trips . thanks for the memories ! the location in westlake ohio did need some serious updating . i guess that 's not happening !
american	only thing nice here is the servers and the atmosphere but then again , we came for some juicy and unhealthy burger and fries . while it 's a fun experience , the food was so disappointing . meats were dry and the fries were soak as if they were fried in lard / oil that wasn 't hot . come here once for fun ? yes . come here again to eat ? hell no .
american	im disappointed after paying $ 95 for two people . best thing on dinner menu was the coffee and the coca cola .
american	from the people that brought you the penguin - another overrated establishment -comes another pseudo- east village hangout for biker wanna be 's . food is uneventful . here ' it 's all about saying you were there . has a seating capacity of about 4 in the entire place.good luck trying to find a seat at lunchtime or weekends . the neighborhood is what they call wesley heights . i call it the seedy edge of uptown . save your money and check out dish in plaza midwood ,
american	very hipster , not family friendly . actually .... not that friendly at all . their demographic is the early 20s crowd and wasn 't very inviting with a family that has a 10yr old and a 63yr old . went to brunch with the family and i was with my nephew , niece , and dad and they definitely did not treat us like the regular brunch going crowd that was hung over the day after partying . food was ok but not that great . keep it pushing ... nothing special here .
american	ordered the eggs benedict and there was one tiny egg . half of the meal was mashed potatoes and half the meal was biscuits and that was it . go find somewhere else to eat you will regret eating here
american	the burgers are okay , the mediterranean dishes are okay but nothing really makes you want to come back . my friends are always raving about their burgers are phenomenal and how their shawarmas are the best in town but i just don 't see it . definitely doesn 't deserve its praise .
american	average ( to downright cold ) service . average burger . average venue . their $ 10 burger week burger wasn 't horrible by any means , just not great .. the salami should have been left off , it didn 't add to the burger at all , i would 've liked the flavour profile much better without it . not for me , and i will probably not be going back here with all the ( much ) better , friendlier & cheaper options around .
american	not bad . not good . overpriced for what seems to be heated up diner food . i was starving so it was convenient but that 's probably the best thing about this place . convenience . in the lobby and open all the time .
american	our service was slow and it wasnt even full . the food was cold and tasted old . the best thing i had here was my drink and buffalo wings . let 's just say i will not be returning here .
american	maybe this was just a product of coming in there at 10pm ? if you 're looking for meat , go to firehouse subs . if you 're looking for a lettuce on a bun , come here !
american	food came out cold . sent out new order of eggs as first were slimey , actually raw . just overall bad .
american	kitchen was soooo slow . and my grilled cheese with bacon and avocado , was missing the avocado . oh , and the garlic fries are overrated . the fresh lemonade was great ! ! and bobby , our server did try to keep us informed , however i did see him start to avoid us , as food was still delayed .
american	whatever this place used to have , it doesn 't anymore . clean sports bar with lots of tvs . don 't bother with the food . frozen fish fillets for the fish and chips , with bagged french fries . fish sticks were gummy and very breaded . nothing is homemade . very disappointed and hungry after my meal .
american	maybe the colleges kids can live with it because it 's cheap , but the consensus of our table was yuck . chili was bland and greasy . nachos were the plainest i 've ever had in my life and most we 're soggy from too much cheese . bbq cheddar sandwich was doused in so much sauce and it all fell out of the stale bun with one bite . not to mention it was barely warm . chicken parm sub - gross . only thing that was okay was the fried zucchini and you thankfully can 't mess that up . waitresses were nice but i 'm not here to suggest servers now am i ?
american	waited 10 minutes at the door before we were seated , 10 minutes before we ordered drinks and another 30 for food . think it could be a great place if they just get there servers in check on how to wait on customers in a timely manner .
american	they have no pickled tomatoes , the corned beef was plentiful , but fatty / tough ( so go for the turkey ) , the break was okay , but not great either . how hard is it to make a sandwich when that is nearly all you make . won 't come again . afterward i heard from other friends / family that they felt the same way and wished i knew before i wasted my money and time .
american	if they sell premade costco chickens as their ' quality bbq ' i think i will go somewhere else ...
american	i see now from their website they have photos and good grief , why is it ok for this chain to use disgusting rubbery canned mushrooms and charge extra for them , but everything else is fresh ? there is no excuse . i am beyond disappointed and grossed out my eggplant sandwich was ruined by canned mushrooms . # lessonlearned
american	we will never go to joes crab shack again .
american	not at the price we paid .... $ 115.00 for our family . got a salad only to get to the dressing and there is no french dressing . all the other dressing choice looked disgusting . get to the pastas and the sauces looked alot to be desired . decided to try the mac and cheese . gross ! pizza choices , non-existant . video board outside shows chicken and such , none of that on the buffet . so i paid for my meal only to eat a baked potato . yippy friggin skippy . never ever again ! absolute rip off ! maybe you should consider a name change to john 's incredibly disappointing pizza .
american	the bread was just alright i had the everything . the corned beef was ok , the swiss cheese was strong and over all it would have been better with cole slaw or sauerkraut but neither was offered . hoping for better , pretty much your average chain sub shop
american	lobster has no flavor which i assume is due to being farm raised and frozen . the bread is stale and bland ... chowder on chowder fries tasted like watered down 7-11 cheese sauce ... to top it off our order came out wrong , they took the wrong sandwich back to sub for the right one & just added butter to the top of the one sent back and pretended like it was the new re-made sandwich ! ! all this for a whopping $ 46.30 per person ! ! such a waste ! ! ! !
american	i went yesterday on all you can eat fish night . it seemed like that 's the only thing they cared about serving . my family ordered two hamburgers and a bowl of chili . we waited around 45 minutes . our waitress ignored us , never apologized for the delay ... people seated after us were getting their second servings before we even got our meal . at least offer a basket of rolls or something ! i will not be going back , as i was made to feel like more of an annoyance ( because we didn 't order the fish ) instead of appreciated customers .
american	) the food is extremely over priced . a burger , fries , and drink will run you $ 11 . their fries are not good . and while their burgers are tasty , theyre just too small . 5 times was one too many . will not be giving my money to this business anymore .
american	however , i typically hate chains and cpk is no different in being overpriced for the miniscule and okay tasting food that you receive . however , i would not rank it as terrible , their pizzas are pretty tasty but everything else is kinda lackluster .
american	it 's not very distinguishable from zinc bistro since its in the same area . we started off the meal with their soggy fried calamari and artisan cheeses that were just average . my boyfriend enjoyed his trout and i liked my pork tenderloin and sauces , but the creamy cornbread ( polenta ) that accompanied the entree had a weird texture . good thing we ordered fingerlings ! my friends had the mahi tacos , but the limes were dry and another had the kobe burgers with mac and cheese . the service was good , always refilling the drinks and available . as a whole the food and restaurant were not memorable and i probably would not ever go there again .
american	nothing like stumbling into jewish deli at 5am on our way home from the clubs .. where else are you served a plate of pickles upon being sat and has gefilte fish on the menu ? ? we were way to entertained to care about the greasy food we were eating . 3 recommendations : go when your wasted , order the grilled cheese and fries , and ask for maria ! ! ! ! we loved you maria ; )
american	my burrito was just eggs in a tortilla and my soy chi was bland and not pleasing . would not come back with all the other great breakfast places around here .
american	no exaggeration ! food was barely edible , steak was over-cooked and tiny , vegetables were obviously microwaved , and the beer wasn 't exactly fresh either . the only reason i 'm giving it two stars is that the wait service was excellent . very accommodating waitress . hostess was kind of rude however . don 't waste your money !
american	we actually had a soft opening coupon and left the majority of our free food ( 2 entrees ) . it just wasnt very good . i was hopeful but we went to a restaurant across the street hungry . the food didnt seem fresh and just didnt taste good . i rarely dont eat something free ... i wish them the best , maybe breakfast is better . the beer was also not good and it wasnt free .
american	omg ! ! ! it 's comfort food to the max gas . the portions may be huge , but the feeling your left with will ruined the rest of your day ! i 'm just saying ! see pic !
american	i had a burger and something called southwest fries ? ? ? ? ? the burger was soooooo over salted it wasn 't even funny ( no i didn 't eat it ) and putting tons of spanish paprika on soggy fries is a total waste of time and not to mention gross . also the place was not very clean would it be an inconvenience for someone to clean all the glass vases above the bar .
american	this place sucks ! ! ! the meatloaf is salty and inedible . i bit into two hard unknown debris hidden in the meatloaf . the matzo ball soup literally taste like balls ! ! $ 19 for the meatloaf , total with soup and drink was over $ 30 . save your money go to a buffet instead ! ! ! !
american	what a depressing place . rooms are so gross . completely dated and run down . website is very deceiving . motel 6 has better options but for a third of the price . i 'm trying to opt out of this deal right now . i 'm hopeful to move hotels entirely .
american	and believe me it is not much ! ! and i am a hungry person .... and sad to say , i was not satisfied . the food items are basic and bland . nothing spectacular . the usual grilled chicken , mashed potatoes and gravy , ham , fatty meats , ... yeah ! ! ! see what i mean , and that is all i can remember because it 's not great ! ! ! if you are staying at sam 's town , do not , i repeat eat here ! ! you will not be happy ! ! !
american	last night i ordered egg plant parm . the eggplant was so thinly sliced i couldn 't taste it . if you want fried bread crumbs this is the dish for you . it was pretty nasty . the meat sauce had no flavor . our food came cold and i wanted reheated but the waitress never came back . she also never took our drink order . so sad . come on people i know you can do better then this . it was really a waste of money .
american	i don 't go to this particular bojangles often but i was craving the chicken tenderloins after a hard workout at the gym . went thru the drive thru and ordered the 4 piece chicken tenderloins combo with a sweet tea . came home and there were only 2.5 chicken tenderloin pieces ! wtf ! for the first time in my life going to this bojangles was a mistake ! either they don 't know how to count 4 chicken tenders or they just decided to gyp someone ! go to other bojangles but i don 't recommend going to this one unless you want to get gypped ! !
american	do not get a car wash here unless you have 30 minutes to waste ! each car takes about 8-10 minutes and my car was still so wet i had to dry it myself . don 't waste your time or money here ...
american	85 % chance that they will either have it completely wrong or give you a 2cm tidbit of chicken and count it as one of your wings . boneless wings are sometimes rubbery too . management seems to be really trying to fix all the fxck ups and keep the employees in order .
american	once we were seated , we basically were never acknowledged after that . we had to flag down at least three people to see if they were even going to come help us . the same hostess that seated us , walked by and asked if we have been helped . nope . we honestly should have left . all we wanted was some drinks and an appetizer . we ended up ordering the buffalo chicken dip . it was a bit spicy and dry . i wasn 't a big fan of it . i honestly wish that they didn 't change the bar since i really enjoyed it when it used to be mad dogs . we probably won 't be returning .
american	you will be happier getting a burger from mcdonald 's . and i 'm very serious . party of four , we all ordered prime rib . it was dry and tough . two out of four potatoes were cold . ordered a pepsi and they delivered a 12 oz bottle and a glass with ice . low rent and terrible food .
american	dog food tastes better ... sorry no stars neg 5 ...
american	all i have to say is ........ i waited 30 minutes for a 12 piece box with biscuits and 20 more minutes after i got the 12 piece for some dirty rice and fries ........ they didn 't even offer me a free apple pie for the wait .
american	you should just cook at home because at toby 's you will practically serve your self !
american	i love smash burger and i am a regular to this location . i have to always check if they put bacon on the sin city burger because sometimes they forget . the past time was the worst . i ordered togo and when i got home i got a nasty surprise . the cook took off their glove and neglected to put it in the proper spot of the trash and left it in my wrapper . i did inform the manager and she was very polite about the situation and apologized . just be aware that the kitchen staff is very forgetful .
american	i 've been here twice and each time my order was incorrect . first i ordered a turkey and cheese sub got home half the ingredients i asked for weren 't on the sub . but i get it things happen so when i went again i informed them and all the guy said was " oh but it must have been good your back again " smh but anyway i ordered what i thought was chicken parm but when i got home it was what look like beef a roni with a piece of chicken on top . i didn 't know chicken parm came with beef . i couldn 't even eat it .
american	all i have to say is the only prime rib they had was well-done - that 's sacrilege - all the other food was the same - over cooked , under the heat lamp too long , or dry - the only thing that was good at this buffet was the clam chowder soup ...
american	all i have to say is , think of the buffet clarke and eddie eat at on vegas vacation ... ok , maybe not that extreme , but pretty close .
american	right ... nope refused to make me breakfast on mother 's day ! ! i finally found something on the lunch menu but the server never took my order ... on mothers day ! ! ! ! that 's all i 'm going to say .
american	i got my son the kids meal chicken strips with fries and let 's just say i was scared to feed my son ! ! chicken was skinny and gross looked like it was put into a microwave and was just re-heated ! wings are super hard and have no meat .
american	i didn 't go there expecting much , but what i did get was an overpriced disappointing burger with fatty bacon . i know it offers what it says on the tine , fast food , but for the price i would have rather have gone to illegal jacks or somewhere . the best bit was the fact that i was hungover and therefore made the most of the diet coke refills !
american	the ambience was nice , loved the wine cellar , but the food was average for a whopping $ 180 price tag using the 4 course sampling menu ... we were all foodies and had high expectations but it was not what we expected . the crab caked were good , but not life changing . i enjoyed the wine , but our server never informed us why the wine were paired with foods or even what was in our dishes .. he was nice but was not as personable as he could be for fine dining . we will most likely not be returning , hopefully the restaurant improves in the future . sushi samba next door seemed to be packed !
american	reminds me of apache burger or jumbo burger in toronto . toppings are fresh , burgers are preformed but cooked decently . they wrap the burgers in tinfoil so they hold in the flavor really well . i had the banquet burger and loved it . the poutine was a total flop , since they use shredded mozzarella instead of cheese curds . a burger is $ 5,50 , no fountain drinks and just expensive bottled drinks . this place is just ok . nothing special . staff were bitchy and rude , and the burger was nothing special . i wont go here again . even asking what the topping were resulted in sarcastic comments and rude body language .
american	i went to mcdonalds and waited behind about 7 cars in the drive thru . when i ordered my diet coke , they said that they were all out in the machine . the lady was also very rude . i also ordered a mcchicken with the works , when i got the mcchicken it was just chicken and the bun . get some better employees who know how to do their job . i guess i 'll be going to burger king from now on
american	rude management . would not recommend . go across the street to lolita .
american	i had to send the first one back cause i well , wanted an omelete without cheese and it came to my table with cheese . so , 15 minutes later , a new omelete showed up . with cheese . i sent it back . how fucking hard is it ? is there some irresistable urge for the cocksucker chef to absolutely fuck up something as simple as an omelete twice ? eggs , sausage , bacon . that 's it asshole , nothing else . i can show ya , its easy . i 've done it a million times . fuck this place .
american	i placed an order to go for the chicken shwarma pita and greek salad combo . the pita was more like a tortilla very thin and falling apart . i could not even take the pita out the wrapper without everything falling out of it . the to go back was full of the garlic sauce . very disappointed i drove out my way for this . the service was friendly but it does not make up for how disappointed i am with my order . waste of money .
american	i don 't expect much from a greasy spoon , but decent fries at least ! better to go up the street to the annex grill .
american	... we were seated immediately which was fabulous . then ... no one even looked at our table for 15 , yes 15 minutes . when our waiter finally decided to show up it took another 5 min to get our drinks and we both had soda . totally unacceptable . then we wait another 15 min for our order to be taken . thank god our food came out when it did because i was ready to walk out the door . two stars because i happen to love their tortilla soup and they have a fun and lengthly drink menu . i may never go back after this though .
american	despite the place being half empty they sat my pregnant wife and i right next to the wait station . tonight we dined on pasta and ass . we won 't be back .
american	shoot even in the womens bathroom is ridiculously loud . turn in down a notch to make it a pleasurable experience , if the wait is as long as it is and the wait staff pretty thin at least let us paying customers enjoy the atmosphere and company
american	food was we expected but service was horrible . i placed my order for myself and 2 kids . picked up my order and went to my table . my son wanted extra condiments so i went the the pick-up area and the manager served three people and she disregarded my attempts to get her attention . i finally got what i needed and went back to table . my son again wanted some extra syrup so i went k ask and she rilled her eyes and handed me syrup saying " if you want something , just ask fr it when u order and it will be on your tray " and walked away ... rude !
american	got a number 7 with tots and a coney . ate it in the car and it all tasted like yesterday 's left overs . just plain horrible .
american	served with creamy island macaroni salad , asian slaw and white rice . with an order of the rumbi fries a mix of sweet potato & regular french fries , with rumbi fry sauce . i was not impressed with my meal at all it was ok and the fried were ok as well . i will not be going back to this spot for lunch anytime soon .
american	for this price could of went texas roadhouse for a decent warm meal . the menus were sticky and disgusting . i didn 't want to touch the menu . be awhile before i come back here
american	i 've been twice . this second time i got the omg french toast . i was expecting more . it was a waste of money for the quantity of food you get and too expensive . i haven 't been back and don 't plan to . head to over easy , joe 's farm grill , the farmhouse , heck go get a breakfast jack from jack in the box instead . the amount of time you 'll waste waiting to get a table isn 't worth it .
american	the place was half full even though the hostess said there was an hour and a half wait . seems like they 're trying to drum up a buzz for this overly conceived douche-o-rama . the food was cold , flavorless , and uninspired . absolutely underwhelming . ( yawn . )
american	get ready to enjoy cold cuts or chicken salad on cold bread with as little condiments or additions as possible for three times the price you would pay if you just went to fry 's and made it yourself . then plop yourself down and enjoy the louder then necessary ramblings of vintage phoenicians at your choice of either the inside dining area that is somewhere between a laughlin casino buffet dining area and a senior citizens hospital cafeteria ; or the outside patio where you can soak in more lime green then is safely recomended by the fda . an arizona tradition . for some reason .
american	all of the food was room temperature .... fries , soup , mac and cheese , meatballs , toast , chicken fingers ...... it feels like leftovers from a bad school lunch .
american	no flavor to the meat the cold salad bar was great . tomato soup and roasted vegetables a must . other than that don 't come for the meat .
american	i 'm from the south and this wouldn 't qualify as bbq in tennessee . very nice people , but the service is slow .
american	beware people ! i was fooled by these fake reviews here on yelp and took my family here for dinner buffet last night . there was a longggg line ... and it made me excited because it must be good . we actually paid $ 35 per adult and $ 20 per kid because it was supposed to be a special meal for thanksgiving . even make me more excited .... however ... big disappointment ! the foods were like crap . selection was soooo little . everyone in my family was angry . most of the guests ( probably hundreds or even thousands of there ) in there were angryyy ... do not go here ! ! ! fake reviews ! ! !
american	we were on floor 6 and our room smelled of smoke . i had to wash all my clothes ( even the ones i did not wear ) when i got home because they smelled so bad . decor is old and needs updating . i wouldn 't go back , unfortunately .
american	my grilled cheese on sourdough was pretty basic . i think i paid $ 7 for some melted cheese slices on toasted sourdough . other items ordered by my group : breakfast burrito ( " sorry , we 're out of salsa " ) , said to be decent , but again pretty basic . another ordered a veggie burger and it was suggested to add fried eggs to it , which he did . he said it was very tasty . will i go back ? probably not . that was a long haul from phoenix . if i find myself some morning in cave creek i would consider it . oh , and also no ( or broken ) air conditioner . fail !
american	all optics , great view and a place to see and be seen , food mediocre , much of ours was overcooked , service was poor. and it was not just our table of six , friends had a totally separate table and had the same bad experience. if you are a foodie , toronto has good places to graze. this is not one .
american	been there probably 5 times and this was the worst ever . my wife and another couple went sunday around 4pm . we all order something different and 3 out of 4 meals were cold except the pizza . our meal was right at $ 70 not including tip . even the kale salad that we always looked forward to was not the same . i don 't mind spending the $ $ as long as the service is good and also the food . sorry guys but it will be a long time before we come back .
american	it 's a pizza , how can you screw it up so horribly ? waist of money
american	service top notch . however the portion size and price for what you get leaves me no choice but 2 stars . i felt violated after my four dollar soda and 13 dollar bite sized salad .
american	all show and no go , snow crab other then king crab , italian station and mexico syations tasted very salty , waited 20 min to get in , counted 25 empty tables , deserts tasted weak , would not go back
american	the wings tend to be greasy and oversauced , fries are always soggy and flavourless . you 're always guaranteed at least one mutant-wing in every 10 you order which is either all fat / skin or has a broken bone that leaked blood and marrow into the meat . anyway , i always avoid the chain , which is a shame because i was once a huge advocate until the awful drop in quality .
american	the initial service was good , then our server disappeared . ordered prime rib and it was under cooked , very fatty and tough . i asked for a manager and after an extended wait had to ask again . finally he showed up . the attitude of both the hostess and manager was very aloof . i have dined at the minnesota kincaid 's locations several times and have always been pleased with all aspects of my dining experience . this location appears to have lost the idea of what a fine dining experience should be . it is such a shame .
american	sandwiches were terrible when i asked for avocado should have made sure it wasn 't a spread thought it was sliced . just disappointed all around
american	it took forever with everyone awkwardly staring at me . karaoke had a 30 person rotation tonight .
american	food is bad , bar style food that 's overpriced . interior is ratty , old and worn . what i picture my grandfather would love to sit at back in the 50s and it probably hasn 't been touched , or cleaned , since .
american	i may try the pulled pork next time - if there is a next time - since it 's close to my office . nice ' soul food ' kind of atmosphere .
american	over here you pay $ 28 and you get to go in and out of this buffet without worrying being hungry . the bad part is that they close at 10 p.m. so it wasn 't worth the price that i paid for . i only had breakfast the 1st time i paid and next morning . $ 28 for two breakfast still cost a little too much for me . another option is to pay each meal separately . i don 't remember the price . i think either way won 't help me save much .
american	the food offerings at the feast buffet at the palace station are no where near as extensive or as well prepared as the buffet at boulder station or sunset station even though the prices are all the same . so if you are thinking of eating here , instead consider the buffet at one of station 's other properties .
american	food is mediocre at best , draft beer is nasty ( i don 't think they ever clean out the lines ) , and the last time i was there ( summer ) , the bathroom was in pretty bad condition . they do draw a crowd of locals but for the life of me , i don 't know why . i only go here if i 'm out with a group and the consensus is to go to owg , but i usually do my best to steer us to another place in hudson .
american	the old white lady here is the most ignorant person i 've seen in a long time . will stick to 7 eleven on liberty .
american	fake friendly doesn 't cut it in the service industry .
american	all the foods look good as they are coming out to the tables , i decided to try their special sausage patti and eggs ... what a mistake , i would be embarrassed to serve it , let alone eat it ... you see the great pictures of bacon etc , , two link sausage or one patti , i was expecting something great .. when delivered it was smaller than a silver dollar , and about as thin ... im sure it was a boxed , frozen patti ..... never buy it ......
american	they forgot three of the items we ordered and after their third trip back to the table they finally got it right . went with a couple other people and tried a variety of items . prawns had no taste . scallops were okay for the first couple but as they rapidly lost any heat they started to taste like bread crumb balls . garlic fries were beyond salty , and as someone who puts salt on their salt , that is saying something . the clam chowder was very disappointing . the java calamari tasted like maple syrup on a flavorless chewy substance . the one redeeming factor was the staff . they were very nice and checked in on us through out the meal .
american	don 't come here with high expectations . not worth our family breakfast meal .
american	meatloaf was hard and cold . theme here is cold . restaurant atmosphere was nice , bathrooms clean .
american	worst ribs , sausage and sauces i have ever had . terrible mac n cheese , biscuits and other sides . service is oblivious until flagged down . the whole table ate less than a 1 / 4 of the meal and felt sick and bloated . gross !
american	all it offered was tator tots , mini corn dogs , waffles , and chicken tenders . no nutrition what so ever except for the fruit and side salad that didn 't contain any sources of fiber or protein . if you 're trying to eat healthy i advise you skip out on nellies as none of my peers were satisfied with their meals . even my friend who ordered only the side asparagus felt sick afterwords . good luck if you decide to dine at nellies .
american	nothing was horrible , but nothing was even above ordinary from what you 'd find at most italian chains . we had the spaghetti bolognese and chicken parm . our waiter was beyond terrible though . it wasn 't one specific thing , just a lot of little things that added up to a poor experience . the bus boy / bread deliverer / water guy was great , and that 's the only thing i can say positively about the place . at these prices , we definitely won 't be back .
american	maybe years of living on the west coast and enjoying fresh seafood made me biased , but ... clams were boiled in water . chowder was watery too . tacos - flavorless . the only thing that i liked were fries that came with mussels and bread with butter . is it worth a $ 90 meal ?
american	i ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich with fries for $ 16 .... they gave me a mountain of mushy disgusting stringy fries and the sandwich bread was stale , the mushroom tastes old and their was a boat load of garlic sauce that left my mouth feeling awful for nearly 24 hours and i 'm dead serious ! if a magazine is gonna call you the best sports bar in north america , the food quality better be there . awful , never coming to this over-hyped place again , could never get before anyways because they claim half the place is reserved before sporting events which is complete bull .
american	the ambiance and decor is nice but the food was just ok . what we had : 1 . turkey sliders - good 2 . lobster rolls - good 3 . earth burger - good 4 . non alcoholic milkshakes - good 5 . sweet potato fries- meh they start you off with a small pail of popcorn . and then they bring your shakes and then the food takes a long time in coming . our lunch for 4 came to $ 96 with tip . if you go , you are going more for the experience and the ambiance rather than the quality of the food . good to try once but you can certainly find better .
american	i had to use bbq sauce for all my meats and that too wasn 't even good ! the crab legs were really skinny , hardly worth the trek of balancing them on your plate . the butter is way too sweet . the service is awful , waiters don 't move for you and always had a scowl on their faces . the only positive is that you can pay an extra $ 35 dollars to skip the line . completely worth it . makes it about $ 100 a person though ( before tip ) .
american	either left over from previous night or way over cooked . mac and cheese was pretty good .
american	this place is literally ran by 16 year olds . no this isn 't some mean way to criticize adults . they are quite literally all kids . no management or oversight and is extremely chaotic . i ordered 2 hot dogs and it took literally 15 minutes . there were like 4 other cars there . avoid .
american	this is the worst location i 've been to . literally only 1 worker smiled and the food was not very good . not sure how or why my lasagna noodles came out brown but it also didn 't taste fresh . when we asked the server he said it comes out like that after going through the oven . umm i 've made homemade lasagna as well as frozen and never had the noodles come out brown . paid way too much for food i didn 't even eat .
american	poor service , horrible stench and waaay over priced drinks . the only think missing was noting that i have twice seen a freaking baby / toddler in mcfaddens well after the appropriate hour . if the ' bouncer ' is checking id 's at the door .... there should not be small children in the freaking place . i wish i could go back and say sorry to all my hotel guests that i 've sent there in the past . i couldn 't help but laugh at loud at the many tables w / " reserved " signs on them . the bar was half empty lol
american	i cannot believe i even tipped the waitress tonight , she was horrible ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
american	all the restaurants up this way have closed down ... the food was fair and the prices were way too high ... they have switched to crooked river bbq ... their grand opening was october 22nd ... we ate there a week later on halloween ... saturday night ... got chicken that looked undercooked ... got ribs that were ok , not awesome ... ordered garlic mashed potatoes , they were out of them ... during grand opening ... hmmmm ... so got hush puppies ... not good ... and cole slaw ... no flavor what so ever ... the rib sauces were good , but the hot bbq sauce was not hot at all ... for a grand opening , we were let down
american	the cathedral cafe is a cafe in the basement of the cathedral . the cathedral cafe helps fund the cathedral , and i love this idea . but don 't go to the wrong place if you 're expecting the other cafe . you 'll be confused and highly disappointed . if you 're not picky about your food and are just wanting a quick lunch or breakfast , then the cathedral cafe would be just fine .
american	i used to love this buffet . but over the years it has gone down hill ; not very fresh , not very tasty , not much to choose from . yet , the price is still up there . i was severely disappointed and won 't be returning .
american	the sandwiches aren 't that great , so there 's no point in buying anything more than the regular whataburger . the staff is friendly , which is the only redeeming quality for me .
american	which means they are probably pumped full of chemicals ( sodium tripolyphosphate ) to keep them plump and moist . and the oysters are not very fresh - uck . add to that the wait and i won 't be back .
american	the service is fine as well as the atmosphere , but the food is terrible ! i have given this place 3 chances and thrown out most of what i ordered every single time . all of the wing sauces are bland and taste nothing like their description on the menu , and all of the appetizers are straight from the frozen food section at costco . this was truly disappointing because i loved the place when it was cleats , but now its just a waste of a building .
american	all these reviews left me disappointed . i got the gold standard ( dry aged beef sirloin burger w / smoked bacon , aged goat cheddar cheese , tomato confit , baby arugula , & garlic-chive aioli ) with regular fries . the fries were good , but the burger was eh . i expected it to be better / juicier / more tender . it was cooked more well-done than medium , which is how i ordered it . bacon was also a little skimpy . not worth it for the price . if you want a tender , amazinggggg burger , go to gordon ramsey 's burgr .
american	the culture at old chicago is hateful and it 's because the servers and managers lack any real ethics .
american	wake up . zeppe 's is proud of their heritage , prying on the sucker . a few years ago a zeppe 's employee tried to steal over $ 250,000 from the grease pit . customers are still paying the money back .
american	plus hair was on bar . .... just not clean at all . but bartender john was cool , and very good .
american	silverware was filmy and the menus greasy . wondered why there were 4 plus waiters just standing around yapping their mouths when they could have been wiping menus , cleaning tables or anything to help improve the ambience . won 't be returning .
american	the service is usually good . i got a coupon through email for my birthday . they said i couldn 't use it because they are corporate and it 's for the franchise locations . that is misleading . i 've never been to the other locations but apparently that 's the only place you can use that coupon . then they ran out of cinnatreats which they advertised . if this is the corporate location is should accommodate more than a franchise . probably won 't be going there anymore .
american	" let me tell you ... this place is definitely over-hyped . we ordered a few different sandwiches and they were all highly mediocre . none of the flavors stood out . i think the hype around this whole chain is that it 's conveniently available and rather affordable for all the drunk patrons walking the strip .
american	pancakes were doughy and the little tiny sausage they gave was insulting . i also had poached eggs , the yolks were cooked solid ? wtf ?
american	finally saw us after we turned to leave . only two of us . man and woman . that means you get less attention . the floors were super sticky . gross . we had more than 4 different people come to our table . simple order of wings . messed up order . we asked for sauce on the side . it 's not sauce . it 's like cold flavored butter paste . it was gross . no wonder hooters are closing down everywhere
american	everything made me nauseated . except the bread . leaving still hungry and very disappointed . and annoyed on so many levels .
american	i have made my own burgers that taste just as good if not better .
american	they make you wear a weird hospital gown which they are very serious about . after eating my very over priced burger , and waiting in the check i took off the silly gown . i was approached by a waitress and told that i must put the gown back on until i leave the restaurant ..
american	you cannot eat or drink here ! if you are not a member should not be in yelp if you can 't enjoy it : - /
american	then when the food arrived it was cold . my in-laws have also gone twice and walked out the second time because the server greeted them and then after 40 min never returned to their table . after three strikes , i am out and never going back .
american	our bill was $ 80 ! most of the time when the food is amazing i will let them take my money . but when the truffle burgers has no flavor , was tough to swallow and the truffle fries and regular fries both taste like stale old pieces of cardboard . paying $ 80 feels like your heart is being torn into pieces . all i am saying is don 't be fooled by long lines and a full restaurant because it is a lie . and if you still plan on eating here the hell 's burger is probably the best thing on the menu .
american	the dishes were soooooooooooooo salty . please review the use of salt in the recipes but for now i won 't take another chance . everything else ; cocktails , appetizer , and salad were very good .
american	after the third cluster they start bringing out scraps that you have to pick thru . when we asked the server about this , she said that 's their policy .... so they do this by design ? ? ! ! after that they bring out small , old looking pieces with hardly any meat in them . the french fries and hushpuppies are one serving only . several other places around ( for less money ) serve consistent quality crab legs throughout the whole meal .
american	" went in for the first time yesterday tuesday the 19th of august , and had very slow service . i waited only 10 minutes for my first piece which was great . after that i waited 25 minutes for another serving . then after i finished that second plate - half the size of the original - i waited 35 minutes for a third . after more than an hour and a half i had less than a single rack of ribs . sincerely , disappointed
american	for 4 people it was about $ 70 and i felt i didnt get anything special .. you guys are talking about best burger this and that and putting this place in your top food lists .. over freaking rated im better off spending $ 15 at in n out. alot of these places i try i just pay for the name everytime it so wasnt worth it sorry but i wont be back
american	no kid menu , charged us $ 8 for watered down apple juice , and gave us dirty plates . staying at the hotel , but will not be eating there again .
american	i appreciate the effort to have something healthy and organic in a mall food court , but for the price and lack of flavor i 'll just go somewhere else .
american	if you 've ever had a real hamburger you know this place is way overpriced compared to the amount and quality of food they serve .
american	your food ain 't all that . a coworker was going by for lunch . i gave him $ 3 to get two double cheeseburgers . the receipt said , with tax , $ 1.83 , for one . damn , i 'll do 7eleven first . two bucks gets me a kick ass chicken sandwich . you need to lower your prices and improve quality of your food . i 'll stay away until then . way too many places to eat and spend my money at .
american	almost 2 hours to wait ... one hour wait and one hour wait on your food ... i was bored i had other things to do ... the food was ok but if you wanna wait two hours of ok food be my guess ... honest true
american	? i understand that you 're carnegie deli and to make matters worse you 're a transplant location in a shitty vegas hotel , but let 's be reasonable here . i wouldn 't pay that price in new york and i certainly wouldn 't pay it here . i don 't care how delicious you are , you are a sandwich ! ! and $ 10- $ 12 for vodka sodas and jack and cokes ? ! ? i remember the good ' ole days of living in the northeast when one could go to one of these delis and have a fantastic lunch or even dinner at a fair and reasonable price . if carnegie deli has its way , those days are long gone .
american	serious ? fries were room temp and oily , burger was very undercooked . service was ok , and the bar and quality of drinks were the only saving grace for this place . seems like a great place for retirees from the midwest who consider red robin as a solid food choice .
american	food was fine , but not so good that you want to eat there again and again . service seems to be a team effort , which was good because some of the team members were good , others , well , not so much . it 's a breakfast diner , so don 't expect too much and you will feel fine when you pay .
american	eggs benedict ! the muffins were not cooked , the ham was thin enough to read a newspaper through and the sauce was not anything close to being acceptable . it was clear and tasteless ! i will say the eggs were properly prepared . clyde simons
american	frozen " sweet potato fries , " " sauteed green beans " had very little flavor and the " country steak " was almost ground with a very greasy gravy . service was mediocre at best . we were there on a saturday afternoon and they weren 't busy so things could have been much better if they tried . assuming they have the skill to do better .
american	in a relative sense , the food at hash house a go go was not as overpriced as some of the other places . the burger was one of the greasiest burgers i have ever eaten . they even coat the outside of the bun with some sort of oil .
american	standing around on a hard floor in heels for half an hour is ridiculous . when we finally did get seated , there was a wedding reception going on upstairs and we couldn 't hear a word the waiters were saying to us . speak up ! i ordered their seafood pasta and had to clean the shrimp myself as the legs were still attached ! chewiest scallops i 've ever had too . the people in the kitchen must not know what they 're doing with seafood . for the price they shlep this crap out at , it needs to be of a higher quality .
american	i don 't know how this place manages to stay in business as there are lots of better places to go in the area . popped in for a beer during ' happy hour ' and i was the only person on the terrace . when i queried the full price , i was informed by the owner that happy hour prices don 't apply if you are sitting outside . that 's a new one . won 't be back and will warn off others .
american	i had the green house salad with no dressing or croutons .. was ok . the food came fast . the place is really noisy .
american	when we walked in the place was pretty crowded . the service was good other then the waitress not knowing it was happy hour . if you eaten at any other out backs the menu is pretty much the same . their tortilla soup was better then most . aarp discounts are not available here on weekends so fit that they get two stars .
american	the bartender is friendly and very knowledgeable . the restaurant is a great size . the employees here are great . very welcoming . the last pizza i ate was uncooked and they had an attitude when i returned it . the last thing i ordered was wings . it was ok going down until i got home i became very sick . the food here is not fresh . management needs to be on watch because it is a great place to go but the food should always be fresh .
american	if i were in a blind folded taste test i would have thought it was a really good whopper . i 've heard so much about this place from the locals but there was nothing significant about it in my opinion . the prices were fair , the burger was less than fair . haven 't been back since , have no plans on visiting again .
american	my philly cheese steak sandwhich was fatty steak , and ended up having some ham inside it . the monte cristo was soggy and soaked in oil and made on french toast . the garden salad was old limp brown lettuce . the grilled cheese has fake kraft cheese on it . the only good to our trip was our waitress was extremely nice . very poor dining experience . do not recommend .
american	this place has not change much since .. last couple decades , including its menu . suggestion ? go check it out if you are categorized in , " family trip on a budget . "
american	not all locations are this way . it was unacceptable . at 7 : 00 am the glass and floors and tables should be spotless . i ordered and took my food home to eat it . also , servers serving hot food should wear gloves . just my opinion but ... i have seen the manager cleaning and arranging the merchandise , but never the associates . take your chances , but i will go somewhere else .
american	waitress tammie was very sweet . and prompt . food- overpriced of course cause on strip . husband got chicken ceaser salad and said it was " ok " i got the fries chicken ... said it was chicken breasts , ... well it 's 3 little chicken strips with some instant potatoes and canned corn . it was fair at best . we live in vegas and it 's our first and last time here .
american	you would think this restaurant with over 2300 reviews would be a slamdunk , but unfortunately it wasn 't . my girlfriend and i drove off the strip several miles to a very unimpressive strip mall , waited in line for 20 minutes only to be thoroughly disappointed . i had the spinach eggs benedict which was very bland ( hollandaise sauce was mediocre ) , and my girlfriend had the works omelette . both came with diablo potatoes which are nothing more than fried , cubed potatoes with some seasoning salt on them . the coffee was good and the banana nut muffin was excellent . everything else i give two stars for in setting my expectations so high and delivering so little .
american	it 's my sons birthday and he loves bacon , oh my goodness . it 's 2 : 45 on a sunday and we ordered drinks and their bacon poppers ..... bacon poppers were excellent , then we waited ..... waited for over an hour and a half . we then asked our waitress how much longer and she said they were just now starting our order ...... needless to say we asked for our check and just left . food menu looked great but i think they are catering more to the biker bar atmosphere . will not be going back or referring anyone there ! terrible service and atmosphere !
american	wth ? how does a coffee cafe on the strip in las vegas ever close ? ? meanwhile , starbucks has two ( 2 ) locations around the mc and both are open and have customers . sambalatte offers way better product-a shame they don 't like to stay open .
american	but a more than 15 wait for two toasted bagels with smear is not . that , by the way , was after a five minute wait just to order and pay . i know that the biggest part of this issue is that a chain like einstein has set ways of doing things , but it would 've been nice to see some of the workers have a little more urgency to get food out . it was so backed up that there was barely a place to stand and wait at 8 : 00am . i don 't even want to know what it may have looked like at 9 : 00 or 10 : 00 .
american	a long time before we go back . 1st , the staff was great , friendly and attentive . the food not so good . the salad bar lacked much to offer in the way of taste . even the chile which you would expect to have some spice to it lacked anything you could get out of a can . for people who think this is healthy think again . one walk down the salad bar and your calories outdo a big mack and fries . $ 12.35 was outrages for something i could make at home ( and taste better ) for $ 2 a serving . to many places to eat for the same or less with great food .
american	overall was not a fan and won 't be back . we were told seating would take 20-25 minutes , 45 minutes later we were seated . potatoes were partly frozen and cold . pancakes were rubbery , eggs were very bland and the sausage was not cooked through . they did have good orange juice though , although we did order three and got two different sizes for no reason .
american	waited a long time for attempt # 2 . the food was not really worth the wait . the manager was clueless about the delay between our order and actual food delivery but did comp us $ 15 off . then had trait for the check to get out of there . worst restaurant experience in a long time
american	the bar-b-q king serves a large variety of food , but everyone seems to come for ( surprise ) the barbecue , hamburgers and hot dogs . the onion rings are served in a heaping pile as well , and it 's one of the few places you can get a cherry lemon sun drop where they actually add the cherry and lemon to the sun drop rather than pour it from premix .
american	the biscuit was hard , the deviled egg wasn 't fresh and my country fried steak was soaked in grease . i always finish my food , but i didn 't / couldn 't finish it here . sucks , but oh well !
american	the desserts were very good , but everything else was just ordinary . bring your wallet if you plan on drinking alcohol . i guess the tribe has to pay for that beautiful new building somehow . drinks way overpriced .
american	ordered hot pastrami sandwich , it was huge , couldn 't finish it . the sandwich itself was pretty basic just a whole lot of meat between two slices of bread . pastrami itself was barely warm , no sauce of any kind just bland pastrami . i should have ordered ruben , would probably have more flavor .
american	went to restaurant half hour before closing ... we were meet by a staff that seemed irritated to serve us . we felt pressured to the point that we just ordered one hot dog and left . note : if you don 't want to work until close and past to clean-up . close earlier ! don 't make the customer feel uncomfortable about getting out .
american	a lot of hype for soggy fries ... i don 't get it ... apparently not so sanitary conditions as well ... city of toronto gave them a conditional pass ... yep , thats a yellow folks !
american	it was prepared by the same person handling the money with dirty nails . he had been smoking and he reeked . i was expecting pickles or peppers on the side with a pastrami sandwich but nothing ! i am totally disappointed . i ordered the wedding soup too but received chicken noodles instead . a waste of $ 16.00 and i tossed it all in the trash ! !
american	the floor was sticky , the service was only okay , and the noise from the kitchen was unforgiveable . the kitchen is very close to the dining room . in the middle of the meal , around 6pm , the kitchen staff began doing something with the dishes that sounded like dishes breaking over and over . i realized that they were probably unloading the dishwasher . where was the owner ? this was obnoxious . we can buy a better burger and warmer , and less dry at in and out , and especially for a lot less money . we will never go back .
american	this place is really overrated and in fact i think all of the restaurants at the wynn and encore suck , outside of the italian seafood spot . save your money and go to a much better buffet at paris .
american	service was good and staff all very friendly to make the experience better . food quality was medium nothing to yelp about . looked better than it tasted . had jerk chicken that was just broiled chicken breasts and a light carribean dipping sauce ( whatever ) . doors were open and the animal kingdom came in . birds flying around and pesky flies and knats nasty ! drinks tasty and presented well . overall mediocre event . probably won 't do it again as there 's lots of options here .
american	this was my first time going here and i must say it was ok . my chicken was salty i absolutely hate overly salty chicken and everything else was ok . this place would not be a top choice place for soul food . the best thing i could honestly say would be that the carrot cake for my desert was about the best thing .
american	a lot of people love sam 's pizza , but i always found it to be mediocre and overpriced .
american	you can do blackened . gumbo was good , but salty . shrimp creole was ok ... but sugary . alligator po boy was average . mostly bread . we didn 't do dessert no alcoholic beverages . 5 / 10
american	more than the food , quality of service and hospitality are more important to me , and that was the environment i was used to at carly 's . sadly , i usually turn down offers to eat there because of this , even though i miss their meatball sub and all of their salads .
american	service was slow , very slow . 25 minutes just to get a salad . drinks remained empty . i was about to leave when my meal finally was brought out to me . if that wasn 't bad enough here is the kicker . my meal said grilled on the menu , it came out fried also they forget my sides . wait , it gets worse to top it all the meal was overpriced 70 dollars for a family of 4 no appetizers and we all had water . needless to say i will not be returning . i hope people will read this before its to late , and no make the mistake of dining here , you will leave dissatisfied .
american	we don 't eat carbs and they are not at all accommodating . so no potatoes & bread but for $ 2.50 i can have a side of fruit . gee , thanks . the restaurant itself is pretty and clean looking . table cloths make it even more special & prices appear reasonable for breakfast .
american	the salad was served in the exact same bowl my family and i use to serve salad at thanksgiving dinner no joke ! it was filled to the brim with salad covered in tons of cheese , too much dressing , and less than extraordinary chicken . so basically i had 3-5 bites and was done just because i was so grossed out . i wish the server would have mentioned the salad was big enough to feed the whole table and the one next to us . but he just completely ignored the fact i didn 't eat any of it . but everyone else at my table seemed to enjoy their gargantuan meals . i will not be going back to eat there .
american	alright first chu 's mexican food sucks and now this ted montana sucks what a beautiful shopping center and you got two restaurants that suck don 't waste your time and money to this place the food is horrible service is all rookies 27 different waiters to my table horrible horrible i 'll never go back i do not recommend this place if you got the extra coin and you want a great steak go to the porterhouse that is an awesome place
american	great atmosphere . the service was the worst part for me . my coleslaw came clearly without dressing , and i kindly asked the server for a side of it , and he told me i was wrong , that there was dressing on it . my girlfriends coleslaw had dressing on it , i tasted it to compair , and mine absolutely did not . i don 't know why he wanted to challenge me on this ? is the 3 cents of dressing that worth it to them ? or does he just enjoy arguing ? either way , unacceptable . i would go back if i had a different server .
american	for lunch on a monday there was only one waitress to a pretty sizeable crowd . the menu doesn 't identify that fries are extra and the amount they give is adequate . would not go here again .
american	i guess it 's a " hip " spot . it 's just a wanna-be mimi 's ( back in the day on bathurst just north of queen , best brunch spot of all time that unfortunately isn 't with us anymore ... ) would not suggest this spot . wanna-be people. wanna-be food .
american	terrible service , had a breakfast brunch for mother 's day and the owner was pushing us out of our table while we were trying to have our meal .
american	very pricey .. when i asked the order taker what was on their burger he replied with " everything ? " making me seem as if i was dumb and continued to do so when i asked him more questions because it was my first time there .
american	i 'm yelping as we sit here . first they forgot one appetizer completely. never said sorry , never acknowledged the absence . nothing . second they forgot an entree completely . it came fifteen minutes late . no apology ? awesome . third they just threw down random desserts for my friends birthday without singing , without acknowledgement . nada . never again . food leaves something to be desired . garnish much ? ? ? ? ? gross . i had chicken risotto and it was honestly half kale .
american	i walked in on a tuesday morning , around 11 am . ordered the eggs benedict and a coffee . sitting at my table and admiring the few degenerates who were sketchily hanging around the entrance , my coffee arrives . complete with a dead fly swirling in the top of the mug . wtf . benny arrives and it is stone fucking cold . swear this could have been made a day ago and no one would be able to tell the difference . bread was soggy , and the meat was tough . probably the worst meal i 've ever had in toronto , ever .
american	we cruised through for some late night snacks . i 'm talking 6 double cheeseburgers deep that 's some top tax bracket mickey dicks order . so we hit the window and we have to ask 4 times . four times. for some ranch packets . that 's mad disrespectful . homie quentin at the first window only dude to really rep us and let us use our coupons . everyone else was mad dumb . i love mcdonald 's . i 'd die for my boy ronald but this location ain 't catching another dollar from ya boy .
american	this place is really popular and i 'd be willing to try other items there which i probably will , but not the gyro . really there is nothing positive i can say about it and i won 't drum on about the negatives but it just wasn 't good . that sucks too cause the service was great and they seem really nice .
american	delivery at 3 : 30am is absolute bliss . but spending $ 30 for two of their pasta dishes " penne ariabata " was definitely not worth it for dinner . we cracked open the dishes when we got back to our apartment only to find out we had boughten noodles with a minimal amount of sauce . it was literally a fucking dish of disappointment . boston pizza does it right , they slap mass amounts of red peppers and sausage in your meal while angela kinda ' just slaps you in the fucking face . you 're welcome for the $ 30 , you literally profited $ 28 . suck my dick .
american	i ordered the standard box combo and the food was made quickly . ( you definitely get your money 's worth on the portion-size ) . the chicken itself is nothing spectacular , i like the strips at chick-fil-a a lot better . the sauce is unique and i 'd definitely try it , though the sample they gave me was a bit watery .
american	oh .. no .. wait .... fourth rude waitress ousts us because there was a party of 8 before us ( of which we were not informed prior to the 30 minute wait ) . really musa ? no .. your brunch just cant be this good ! needless to say , i cant review the food .. i walked out after the 45 minute musa ordeal . if there was a zero star on yelp : musa 's service would get it .
american	but let me tell you , the shitty $ 1.99 bottomless coffee , hash browns , and omelet stuffed with all sorts of processed cheese and meat ... is the best hangover cure ever . the place is like denny 's . big whoop . everyone there seems a little depressed .... customers , staff , everyone . but hey , with that type of environment going in your sweatpants and with a hangover ... you fit right in .
american	so we go there no crowd like two tables , we decide on our dinners and my father and i decide on the beef brisket , but wait they 're out of it already at 6 : 00 wth ? so we have the 3 little pigs sounds good right ? well it was but the problem was mine came out 20 minutes after the other 3 meals were served.how is that ? anyways our waitress did apologize and gave me a free dessert but that was just bs in my opinion ! so for me it was a one and done ! ! ! ! ! good luck
american	unacceptable red robin you need to teach your staff to be more attentive to the clients because i have never been so astonished at how rude these staff was ! ! ! ! will not everrrr return to this location !
american	what a disappointment . i should 've learned my lesson the first time . my boyfriend and i shared the linguini and clam , louisiana crab cakes , and a bowl of their boston clam chowder . the linguini was very bland . i had to add hot sauce and a lot of salt to bring some flavor to the dish . the crab cakes weren 't as bad , it had flavor but the mustard dressing didn 't compliment the dish . clam chowder was probably the highlight of this visit . lots of flavor , rich and creamy . from one foodie to another , stick with the clam chowder .
american	poor service . tasteless food . terrible presentation . poor access . dark atmosphere . all in all , there are far far better buffets on the strip .
american	the charcuterie was stale , the artichoke dip was just boring and tasted like sour cream with some garlic powder . the service is truly abominable- they all seem confused and slow . if you must be on a roof , fine . but you 'll be frustrated with the wait times for anything you ask for and crap food .
american	alright well im going to have to say that my wife and i always try to get some good bbq from this place and when it was open it was amazing but they have been on vacation for about 3 months and its very upsetting to try to go get some bbq and they always have on their door that there still on vacation ...... awful .... wish they were dependable ....
american	i ended up scarfing down my salad from the plastic bag . the salad was really good to be fair ( tomato basil dressing on buff chix , yum ) , but seriously invest in real " to-go " containers people it 's 2011 already jeziz .
american	first in foremost the burgers were very dry and bland . next the cheese fries . if they decided to stop being so cheap and put a little more cheese on the fries they would be delicious . i personally thought everything there was super dry and hard . i only recommend this place to those who are seeking dry food
american	the fried turkeys are done in advance and you pick it up cold to thaw and then pop in the oven . i don 't like to reheat anything that was once fried . i 'm beyond disappointed . $ 39.95 before tax . order and pay in advance .
american	+ some overcooked bacon . maybe i should start a breakfast service too . all i need is a restaurant that is a cross between a run-down sports bar and pub .
american	he has apparently sold both locations . this one is now something like " taste of chicago . " had a chicago dog there and it was ok , but the place has lost its charm . al , i hope you 're doing ok and weren 't a victim of the recession .
american	" if you 're incarcerated at mandalay bay and you 're seeking breakfast a la denny 's at strip prices , this is the place for you . mediocre .
american	waitstaff if they weren 't over the top friendly they seemed bothered . the cooks really made me feel like i was bothering them . really your job is to cut me roast beef sorry its so tough you need a chainsaw to get through it not my fault . all in all pretty crappy . i tried it 3 times breakfast , lunch , and dinner gross , grosser , grossest guess i wasn 't drunk enough . what really sucks is unless you want to have a $ 100 meal or a .99cent shrimp cocktail that was the best option . very disappointed
american	potatoes were cold and everything had the same greek salad dressing poured on top . some of the food was not too bad but the experience was disappointing . food served on thin disposable plates , cutlery was such cheap plastic that it seemed like rubber .
american	not permitted to provide water to dogs in 95 degree weather due to " health code . " have never been to " dog friendly " place where this has ever been an issue . dog lovers should avoid .
american	to sum it up , " it isn 't that bad . " my muffeleta sandwich included a gigantic handful of cold olives in the middle of my otherwise warm lunch , but my friend 's salad seemed quite tasty . my bread was craggy and hard . my side of carrots instead of chips were scary looking . ( they looked like baby carrots that have been sitting in your fridge for 3 weeks ) i may return , but not upon my own volition . panera is better , way better . ( 2.5 stars )
american	usually coming here with my dad , it seems to be the go-to breakfast place that hasn 't adapted their menu . no meaningful gluten free options . nor organic eggs . most of their dishes are covered in cheese , but all of them are from cows ( the feta isn 't even goat , or sheep .... sorry lactose intolerant people ! ) if you have any diet sensitivities or trying to eat clean , give this place a pass . if they would come out of the dark ages with ingredients and quality , this place would shoot up two or three more stars .
american	food is below average and overprice for the quality . beer is not memorable but you will see this place crowded anyway , because of the lengthy patio an huge windows which gives a nice view over the street to it . good spot for watching people and that is about it .
american	tried to order schnitzel since it 's the wednesday special but by 8 : 30pm they had ran out . ordered the perogies and wild boar bratwurst between 2 people ; and the portions were so small . for being $ 14 each , i was hoping it would at least be a substantial amount that people weren 't still extremely hungry afterwards . i won 't come back to eat here , unless they up their portion sizes . 5 stars for the weizenbock though !
american	we were really looking forward to a " hot " pastrami but the meat was hardly lukewarm bordering on room temperature . we have no problem spending $ 30 on two sandwiches on a drink if it was worth it but these were not ... will not return .
american	the course should not have both games being played concurrently . not safe ! ! in addition we constantly had to wait on them which really extended our game .... waiting . not fun or safe .
american	the concept is good , and there are not a lot of choices , but it i just thought the preparation of the food could have been better . the cheese is absolutely disgusting , but the veggie patty itself , is not bad . i may have try the other stuff on the menu , but the first time trying it with the vegan burger , was not the best experience .
american	not everyone wants spice in their sandwiches , and they could do better . i would re-think the menu and learn how to do a real grilled cheese .
american	i ordered the red beans and rice and bourbon chicken . i was expecting chunks of bourbon chicken but it was shredded . i believe the red beans and rice came with some andouille sausage , but the sausage lacked kick . perhaps this is what j gumbo 's meant by how neither of these dishes were spicy since j gumbos has a spice rating on their menu . if / when i go back , i plan to go for the very spicy stuff in hopes of more flavor .
american	next time i am in vegas i will have to give this place a second try . thank you management for caring , it goes a long way
american	the hostess suggested that we buy a souvenir t-shirt - no thanks , the sleeveless shirt my husband had on was way nicer ! ! please update your website so everyone is aware of this dress code .
american	hostess said there would be a 15-20 minute wait for my party of one . with a less than half-filled dining room it was obvious they were understaffed was offered a seat at the near empty bar . five minutes before the female bartender asked what i wanted to drink . got the drink and then stared at the menu and tv for another 10 minutes while she made drinks and i walked out the door . and the folks in the lobby were still waiting .
american	it must be kept under a heat lamp because i ordered it and it came up within minutes , over cooked and rather dry . i could tell this even though i ordered the thai chili sauce on it ( which was more sweet than spicy ) . phx needs to have a better selection of places to eat .. the service was timely and great and you pay the airport price .
american	it took us an hour to check in . the restaurants were mostly overpriced and mediocre but what was really lacking was the service . we had no maid service at all . i took towels off the cart so i could at least have clean ones for day two . and when we tried to leave the parking meter did not work and we were literally locked in the parking structure . i still don 't know if i paid twice for parking . definitely not my favorite place to stay and i wouldn 't recommend it .
american	first , as a line developed and one girl was serving , preparing and working register , their other employee was sweeping the floor ( wasn 't that dirty ) oblivious to the line etc .. then while i prepared my coffee she was sweeping practically between my legs with a large industrial broome . just before i prepared coffee i set my newspaper on a table and when i was done i returned to table and it was gone . to her credit the sweeper apologized . so she then told me they are closing at 3pm ( it was 1pm when this all happened . ) i am hoping this was just a bad day as i really do like it here .
american	sigh , i 'm disappointed . the food was mediocre and quite pricey for a chicken avocado sandwich & a pizza with just bread and fluffy cheese on it for $ 14 ? ! ? ! extra toppings were $ 1 + more per topping . i think the pizza was called casper something on the menu . the service was alright , wait wasn 't too bad , & the desserts were generously portioned . would i come back ? probably not . but i still love the movie ! = )
american	the kid 's pancakes were all air - no substance or flavor . the spicy honey chicken biscuit sounded great but the biscuit flaked apart and got soggy from their honey sauce , there was nothing to it but for $ 4.99 i left half and didn 't bother to complain ... my husband left half his meal and that alone spoke words ( he rarely leaves food on the plate ) ! so , not sure why this place has so many positive reviews , but with great competition around the neighborhood - i don 't see this place lasting long , then again denny 's is still around ( insert gross face ) !
american	it was busy and service was terrible . our order got lost and we were promised a discount . we never got the discount . our waitress , gina , had a little bit of an attitude . burger was sub par fries were ok .
american	although it was the cheapest buffet on the strip with crab legs ( which influenced me ) i was very disappointed ... selection was very limited and prime rib was well done , deserts and salad bar also disappointing ... i will not go back .
american	i had the country fried steak dinner , with greens , mac and cheese , and okra . the flavor was great , but within an hour after leaving the restaurant , i was hit with some serious food poisoning . luckily , neither my wife or daughter ended up ill , but i am dealing with the after effects today with severe abdominal pain and most of my day spent in the lavatory . never again .
american	i ordered the jambalaya and after eating a few bites , found a one inch long metal wire in it . the manager replace the dish very rapidly for the same . not sure if i will be able to go back there with that experience .
american	only 3 pieces of spicy chicken left to fill my 10-piece order . and none of it tasted fresh . the mac and cheese was good , and the fried okra wasn 't bad . but , man , that chicken was vile ! the crew here seems to be mastering the skill of the vacant stare .
american	the service was awesome , the price was decent , and the food was mediocre . the carving station was my favorite part of the buffet and the bottomless mimosas ! we were celebrating a birthday and the host was very accommodating by allowing us to decorate the table . overall , i wouldn 't return but it 's a great way to celebrate with a large group !
american	since i can only comment on their gyro ; here goes ... first , the meat is embroiled with fatty particles ( it 's fake meat or something ) , second ; they don 't include enough dressing , third ; there are way , way too many onions , forth ; there were only two very small slices of tomatoe , fifth ; the feta cheese is not crumbled but in a patty , sixth ; they just pile the stuff on top of a pita , - to be quite honest , it just tastes bad .
american	it would have been better for them to never even offer , if they had no follow through plans . now i not only had a less than impressive experience at the restaurant , but now i also have a poor impression of their corporate office as well .
american	the ownership certainly has no interest in anything but profits . the slow service has gotten slower ; the food quality has been deteriorating for over a year ; prices have been going up ( $ 16 for fish tacos ? ) ; and now if you choose a healthy alternative to their french fries , like coleslaw , fruit , or a side salad ( no extra charge at 99 % of restaurants ) , they whack you an extra $ 2 . this place , which started out as one of my favorites , is about as customer and health unfriendly as you will find in this area .
american	they don 't pay attention to the timers because every time i order food , the meat is stale as if it was cooked and stored for awhile , longer than recommended . the buns are also hard and stale due to them toasting a bunch of them before they get orders , which could be 30 minutes away . so in the end your not getting what 's advertised or recommended by mcdonald 's standards , due to worker neglect of job responsibilities . oh this is what a large fry looks like no lie . and half burnt
american	donatos is ok for " pizza hut / domino 's " kind of pizza . definitely not like a real ny pie , but pizza is hard to mess up . so although it doesn 't taste authentic or anything , if you want a fast , greasy piece of pizza you could eat this and feel slightly satisfied . i do think the prices are a little high for the quality . nice staff and fast delivery .
american	after complaining of the rude service , for which we were given the excuse of a busy weekend , we asked to be connected with management , who never followed up . unacceptable !
american	the little pieces of fried chicken were perfectly cooked but the sauce was greasy and reminded me of chef boy r dee . nasty ! the spaghetti noodles were also overcooked . the french fries were good .
american	it is the bar / restaurant closest to my home . in spite of its convenient location , after my most recent visit i will not be returning . why would i when the staff can 't be bothered to feign a minimal civility ? i see from the preceding yelp reviews others feel the same . maybe the next owners will have a higher regard for their customers .
american	i don 't usually feel that i have to check my to go orders from from kfc but i will definetely check every item in the future . after getting past the hard biscuits we opened a container of " gravy " which was just was brown water . in all of my years eating at kfc throughout the country , this was a first . so either the cooks were lazy or kfc has changed their recipe . i am sending them a video and will hopefully get an answer . i am giving them one star because i am holding everyone responsible for this . they all saw the brown water and still served it .
american	really did not live up to the hype we were looking forward to . food ok .
american	the staff was not knowledgable about the food , and even after we had an issue and the server offered to get a manager , the manager never came by . they comped the problem food but couldn 't be bothered to stop in and ask what our issue was . even though i am a local bringing in a guest . the drinks are good , ambiance was nice but overall i would not recommend it .
american	the restaurant staff didn 't even tell our waiter we were his table to start the event off with . he 's tried so hard to make our time here better , but bad food and irresponsible management are 2 of my biggest turn offs for any restaurant . my flatbread was soggy , the chicken was dry , and was cold . it took forever to get service . they messed up my sister 's order , including the wrong items . and , didn 't include certain requested sides for the other 2 people in our parties dishes .
american	we had a birthday celebration and had a few extra add ons including a few significant others in which we called well over 8 hours in advanced and apparently they could not even accolade one extra chair which was crap . through out our meal there was multiple tables and extra chairs all around our party . also i had a decent pizza and ate a slice packed up the rest to go and left it on the table- no one even had the curtesy to ring us or even let us know when we walked out and left an entire pizza on the table . customer service below average with sub par food . wouldn 't recommend .
american	no substations of any kind are allowed . the eggs benedict with house cured salmon came out cold , the baby roasted potatoes were so greasy that when you forked the potato to cut it it oozed out grease , also cold . with so many places to go why bother ?
american	the chipotle eggs benedict was just ok . the chipotle hollandaise was bland even compared to a plain hollandaise . there was nothing " tres leches " about the very pedestrian french toast and the breakfast potatoes were , well , boring . i got a taste of my friend 's pad thai and that had a nice kick . i 've enjoyed several visits to the vig uptown , but never for brunch . if we go to mcdowell mountain again , it will be in cooler temps to relax on the gorgeous patio . we 'll take advantage of the $ 3 mimosas and $ 4 bloody bar , but we 'll order lunch .
american	the wings are fatty and oil pours out of them when you bite into them . and you have to love the slimy feel of the skin on your lips . yum ! ! ! if i was only going for a beer then maybe i would come back but for food there are many fast food restaurants in the area that i would suggest picking from first .
american	the server was inattentive and seemed annoyed when we asked questions about the menu . when we finally got our food it was mediocre at best- my friend 's eggs were cold , and my " omelet " was more like a pile of greasy scrambled eggs . my other friend ordered the benedict and it was on a bagel , which made it nearly impossible to eat . not worth the stop . the picture is of the " omelet " i ordered , which had literally a whole , uncut sausage patty inside ....
american	the wait was outrageous . service was okay but not great . food was just okay and didn 't match the price . quite expensive for a breakfast joint . turns into a loud " club-like " atmosphere after 9am . i live around here and highly recommend butterfields instead .
american	not to mention , they took 50 + minutes to come out ! although our waiter was open to remedying the situation by giving us a fresh order of wings , waiting over 1 hour for our deep dish pizza was quite annoying considering they weren 't very busy . they seamed to have a lot of staff on the floor , but perhaps there was only one chef ... to be honest , the " meaty legend " deep dish was not so legendary . merely quite mediocre . if you 're thinking about just getting take out to avoid the wait , you 'll have to wait until they start their carry out service in june .
american	the coleslaw was not great either . the restaurant is clean as always but i 've been here more than once now and was not very impressed . i 'm a big fan of popeye 's normally but this location for some reason is not hitting the mark . i usually go to the new location that opened not too long ago in south mesa . so far and up until recently their food tasted much better . not sure i will be visiting this location again .
american	the service is horrible . the actual chez carl is much better than this .
american	3 ) our waiter kept petting a dog on way to serve us our food . dog licked hands and food is a no no . 4 ) overall food is mediocre and little overpriced for its quality 5 ) concept of live music is nice , but come here if you want to scream your conversation 6 ) maybe nice to watch a game with beer and friends wouldn 't come again though .
american	we had a group of 6 , we waited 35 min for a table , and then additional hour and 15 for our food to arrive ! followed by another long wait to take care of our bill . in all we spent a little over 2 hrs here , most of which was waiting ! we saw other groups / tables order , get their food , pay and leave before we even got our food . our server was pleasant and was really trying to accommodate , but our group was not huge and we ordered nothing complicated--just not worth the wait in my opinion .
american	i myself had the lobster bisque , which had excellent flavor but had a tiny amount of lobster in it . the two that got sick had their pepperoni pizza and the lasagna . didn 't expect to spend the last day in vegas recovering ... prices were fair and service was great .
american	they charge you an extra $ 2 for their " home made " blue cheese dressing . ( it 's a very small container that 's hardly enough for a salad ) . also the service is horrible . if your going to put these prices , go to someplace like nioras where you get more for your money , amazing food and great service .
american	my coworkers loves this place so we typically get there once or twice a month for lunch , and every time i can 't believe how long it takes to get in an out . food typically takes over 30 minutes , regardless of what you get . the specialty pizzas are great , but at about $ 25 for a large is very overpriced . not worth going in unless you 're looking for a long meal .
american	the larger lady who is often serving or at cash is sarcastic and makes me feel unwelcome every time i come in . i hope that if lynn reads this , she will not hire her for ruby watch co ( since ruby eats is closing ) it would create bad reviews in a great restaurant .
american	we 'd been seated for an hour before we even got water , an hour and a half till drinks finally arrived and two hours till food hit the table . to be fair , the server who finally made things happen was great and doing the best she could , but it took a couple of tries to finally get someone who could get the job done . too bad - there 's a lot to like about this place .
american	the pancakes were large , moist and fluffy . what earns this place such a low score are its slow and absent service , and total lack of cleanliness and upkeep . our table was wobbly and taped up . the floor was dirty , sticky and riddled with other patrons ' crumbs . the entrance door was left open , which resulted in flies coming in and out throughout our stay . the kitchen ( open concept ) looked grimy and messy . the waitress / hostess also walked in and out of the restaurant , leaving us to wonder if our food was going to come out . i wouldn 't go back .
american	this is the slowest ! it took me 7 minutes to get my quarter pounder burger . there was 2 customers ahead of me , who got their meals before i did on this visit .
american	price and horrible service make this restaurant a lose lose . we ate here for dinner last night and for breakfast this morning . same terrible service both times and the prices are absolutely staggering . seriously four dollars for an egg and six dollars for an english muffin ? ! not to mention my $ 70 steak last night . i mean seriously ! ! it cost less to eat at four seasons .
american	long wait , apology but nothing behind it . we had a reservation , were there for two plus hours and had one bottle of water and one drink . he never came back to see how we were if we needed anything ... no word from the manager not even a sorry . we won 't return .
american	a past favorite however , the restaurant needs a serious deep clean ! the floors , chandeliers , silk plants and even the wall areas around the kitchen vents ( clearly in view from the dining area ) seem neglected and in my opinion unacceptable in a restaurant . it made me feel - what is the food quality ? it was fine by the way ! our server , ashley- needs additional training on service as she constantly walked up to our table and abruptly interrupted our conversation . with so many options nearby - this location needs attention to stay in the mix !
american	wait staff wear tee shirts with large , graphic handguns and the words " buy me breakfast . " i find this imagery inappropriate for the neighborhood and especially insensitive for charlotte at this time . not cute at all .
american	although the location and seating outside were great the place scored very low on recent visit for lunch. very pricy for what u get pre made salads looked small and unappelling. our sandwiches were lacking the main ingreditants which left them very small mostly bread which was dry. soup was cold a .. even with our groupon coupon our bill for 3 people was $ 20 would not recommend this place ..
american	the staff has been terrible for years . the menu is a bunch of unappetizing crap , and no matter who is in that kitchen , nothing ever turns out appetizing . if they redid everything this would be a clutch spot in noda . until then , i will avoid it like the plague .
american	the shrimp with remoulade was bland . something was definitely missing in the ingredients . my main course of crawfish etoufee was just as disappointing and bland and didn 't look good . sorry but this is another diners , drive ins and dive disappointment in my opinion . this is a delayed review from april 2014 , i 've had health issues .
american	we had a half glass of red wine spilt on an expensive shirt by our server , len . not only was the glass not complimentary after that , but a new glass was not offered . furthermore , the only way this accident was addressed , was with a very rude statement of " if the stain doesn 't come out , call me tomorrow and we 'll see what we can do . " we understand that accidents happen , but that is unacceptable and poor service ! we won 't be back .
american	although the people are great with customer , i believe the cheba hut on southern has better sandwiches .
american	it tasted okay , but i was in the washroom for hours that night - i hadn 't eaten anything else that day that could have been responsible , and i 've had this meal before at other pbs . oh well - i won 't be going back ...
american	the food is expensive for the quality you get . i also noticed a short , red-haired manager yelling at several of their employees . it really brought a negative atmosphere to the restaurant experience . i will be going to spinatos from now on !
american	close to an hour slow . two of us ordered the west of the andes which were reported as good . one had the eggs and salmon which would have been better if it had arrived while the bloody mary still had ice . incidentally , poached eggs are not available probably because they might have fossilized before serving . my ace burger was pretty good but not worth the wait . there 's a chance we might return but not a great one .
american	it is definitely pricey and the customer service sucks ! my husband is a huge fan of bbq and likes the smokehouse recipe that is used but noticeably there is more fat on the meat than there is actual " meat ... " personally , i do like the butter biscuits with their sweet honey butter- but they are very stingy as they only serve 2 at a time ... so when you ask for more- the waitress definitely takes forever to get more in hopes that you have forgotten your original request .... it is somewhat tasty - but for the lack of customer service and overly priced menu : it 's not worth visiting / making regular attempts !
american	my boyfriend and i ordered dessert and breakfast as our entrees and they brought out my breakfast first , but never brought out my boyfriends breakfast as it " took longer to cook . " they ended up comping the breakfast and both of our drinks , but still .
american	$ 27 for a couple sandwiches and a side of fries seems a bit steep . i had the pulled pork sandwich which was piled high , but the sauce had too much vinegar for my tastes . my wife had the murray hill sub - a cold-cut sandwich on a sub roll . nothing special - especially with a $ 10 price tag . the eggplant fries were interesting , however they could have been better a bit crispier .
american	ran out of mac & cheese on the first day you open for the week ? no ribs either & your title says mrs.c. bbq ? ask for catfish , when i got home , it was frozen whiting , i could buy from walmart ! porkchops were shoulder cut , like in assorted pkg . , not center cut ! yams had to much cloves & dark . greens were so salty ! took a long time to get food . a ) food should be tasty & good , store front clean & organized this place looks like something from 1962 .
american	my wife and i tried the grilled shrimp and octopus cocktail which tasted like it had been frozen ( and no evidence of any of it being grilled ) and the flavor was just ehh , and the proscuitto wrapped veal entree was just as uninspiring . well cooked but borrring . the fact that you pay $ 35 for an entree and may need to add additional sides is a bit unnerving as well . good , attentive service but if you are a foodie , i would try elsewhere .
american	when i asked to be seated two tables over the hostess said no ! ! ! what ? no ! ! ! ! we went across the casino to gordon ramsey ' s pub and had a wonderful meal with the best service . bobby flay gets a zero for not overseeing his staff and forgetting that the customers come first .
american	we and a couple of friends ordered the three fruit crepes with warm compote , chicken fettuccine , and chicken fried steak . crepes- weren 't too satisfied with the artificial flavored syrup and coloring . chicken fettuccine- chicken was lacking seasoning , not very tasteful . we don 't believe we would return back here in the near future .
american	thankfully it only lasted about 12 hours , and didn 't ruin my whole trip . the deli seemed to be well run , and the service was quite fast and good . naturally they charge a lot for the food , but when you are staying at encore , that 's how it goes : )
american	i ordered my sandwich and while checking out , i said to the manager , is she in a bad mood ..... and instead of apologizing , she made the excuse that she 's working alone and that i would be crabby too ..... seriously ? ? ? ! ! ! i don 't care if i 'm starving , i will never go to this establishment again , i would rather go across the floor to mcdonalds , where the food may not be as good , but at least the service is far more friendly and less abusive .
american	we had some issues and asked to talk with the manager who never came over ? kind of embarrassing since we made these reservations and invited friends to join us . so of course it was our friend that had the issue . i will cut them some slack since it appeared they were not ready for the maroon 5 concert crowd . but ... really ? food seemed to either be very good or lacking in quality . so consistency was a big issue .
american	the roasted olive appetizer and wine selection was good . our three entrees and two salads were not good . pizza was cooked to a frisbee-hard disk ; fra diavolo pasta was mushy and shrimp fishy ; chicken pasta was a hard balls of stuck- together noodles and rubber bird meat . if we had time to spare we would have sent all three entrees plus the two salads back to the kitchen . so many choices in downtown phx - skip this one !
american	we called ahead to make sure that they had oysters , but were told that they were out about five minutes after we had placed our order . shortly after , we were informed that they were also out of the seafood pasta dish which two of the people in our party had ordered . i can 't understand why a restaurant with " raw bar " in it 's name would be so nonchalant about running out of oysters . very disappointing . the food wasn 't impressive enough to make us give it another try .
american	their quality has taken an incredibly sharp nose dive . and the atmoshere at the palms casino is reminiscent of eating lunch in a chemistry lab . it 's a real shame , i 've been eating at hooters for nearly 30 years but i think i 'm done now . i had my whole family with me and they all agree . it just lacked the rustic flare of the originals .
american	when it was " my big fat greek gyro " things were better . the food was fresher and the flavors were better . now , it appears ( and tastes ) as though the meats and fillings for your bowl or pita sit out all day . it 's also a little more on the pricey side , which makes a disappointing trip even worse .
american	the micro-brews were so-so . four peaks wins by miles and miles .
american	cheese was not even cooked to the pizza dough properly and was loaded onto a double pepperoni when i specifically asked for no top cheese . i am well aware that pizza is greasy , but the amount of grease from one slice of it alone was enough to soak up two napkins . i don 't care how great of deals that they give out on their coupons , personally it is not worth it to me . will not be going back here ever again . much better pizza out there folks ! !
american	the chili was extremely salty and the shake had a weird metal aftertaste . it was a waste of my money and i had to go find something more edible elsewhere .
american	we went to mother 's day brunch which was $ 26 for a buffet spread that was less than average . i would probably not go back again .
american	my husband and i both had a brown salad before our meal . he ordered the chicken fried steak and it ended up being equivalent to junior high cafeteria frozen patties . i orders lasagna and it was hard and chewy on the outside and looked a bit mysterious on the inside . i would not recommend this place . we should have spent that $ 25 elsewhere .
american	i had the classic burger with onion rings . the onion rings were greasy and the burger was nothing special .
american	the menu is super generic and pizza is way too much crust and very basic ingredients . would expect more from a place that specializes in pizza .
american	sonic hot it right with their chicago dog . it could be a little bigger but overall it 's pretty good . tater tots are always on point !
american	we placed a take out order for a family meal to be picked up 45 minutes later . i arrived at the pickup time and had to wait 20 minutes for the food because of understaffing . the meats were all dry without bbq sauce and there was no bbq sauce in an extra container . the sausage was tasty , but slightly burnt . as for the sides , the pork-n-beans were good , the mac-n-cheese average and the side salad fresh but very small . pretty disappointing overall , but i guess phoenix isn 't really known for bbq .
american	their specials were all over the place from a seabass salad to steak . should have stuck with the italian theme and ordered ravioli . i ordered a chili bean dish which ended up being a sad pass as a burrito complete with salsa with no flavor and creme fraiche instead of sour cream . come on ! google mexican and get it right , man . my sisters pulled pork sandwich was awesome but even on her plate there was some disappointment like the potato chips that were cut too thick . i will say , the chocolate nutella peanut butter cake was nice but when i ordered a flat white i was served a latte . ugh . give it a miss .
american	i ordered lasagne and when i bit into a piece it was delicious . however , as i continued to eat i realized the middle was cold . it was as if it was frozen and they placed it in the oven to warm up but they didn 't leave it long enough . not a great experience and it 's been hard to convince anyone to return with me to give it a second chance . i would return again becomes the place is always packed and everyone seems to love it . i think if the environment is positive it 's worth at least a second chance
american	the kitchen is always out of several items and the poor wait staff has to make excuses . step it up bar 145 . too many good restaurants in kent now for your management to let the kitchen slide .
american	they are located in the center of the 6th largest city and they have exactly one cash register . and not only that , the staff move as if they are mentally challenged and have an iq of 60 . the food is typical church 's but ya ' might want to plan ahead and make sure you have plenty of extra free time ...
american	the food was good , but the service was not what it used to be. we came in with a party of 7 . we were seated pretty quick since we had a big party . they took about 15 minutes after seating just to come take out drink orders and were slow clearing off our old plates . to me this used to be a 4 or 5 star place , but seems like the service is getting worse . they also ran out of plates at the dessert station and took them more than 20 minutes to refill them .
american	we hardly come to this location but every time we do , the service is horrible ! the group i go with had to ask the hostess to get us drinks and find us a waiter ! the food took an extremely long time and the restaurant wasn 't even busy . the waiter never re filled our glasses and we only saw him once . need major help !
american	bluebird is the reason i am here . i want to load $ 1000 onto my card . lately the outcome is completely unpredictable . i called corporate to complain and they pass me off to the store manager . i get the same canned response , the lack of training and policy understanding flows from the managers through the cashiers .
american	food is really so delicious but a more recent visit wasn 't impressed . had an off experience which i communicated to the restaurant which i and all patrons would think was not cool and have never heard back . i 'm a fair honest person so due to the fact they don 't care about patron concerns when it comes to their staff and their cleanliness and manner then i 'll take my money elsewhere . i 'd say they were top cleveland restaurant but have to move on .
american	i order egg mcmuffin a and usually get burned buns ... always check your order before driving off ! ! ! !
american	been a few times on fridays and weekends and there is usually just one waitress and you have to wait to get your first beer . if you ever need anything you are constantly looking around and trying to waive down the next person you see . food is good , but service is either poor or just frustrating . one time i ordered a beer , thought it was great so ordered it again . had to waive down a different person only to hear that the beer i " ordered " had been out . a collaboration of workers couldn 't figure out what they gave me ...
american	until now . i thought i 'd give it a try after disappointment at another pete 's , but it was the same quality . i got the shrimp & chips , which is my favorite , or use to be . they 've changed that batter or just using a costco type frozen brand . not the same pete 's i grew up on . the fries aren 't even worth the effort to review . my 2 stars is for the pete 's sauce . i need someone to recommend a good fish chip place to go .
american	service severely lacking on this visit . destinie was overwhelmed . table sat in her section after us was greeted , order taken and appetizers delivered before our order was taken . she did have a decent working knowledge of kitchen offering timing as we ordered . food quality remains good and a staple to vegas must try restaurants off the beaten path .
american	it 's a shame because the food is good , just not good enough for that kind of wait time .
american	today i go through drive thru and ask for 2 hamburgers ketchup only . first she tells me they ran out of hamburger buns and only have sesame buns . fine . then she kept saying only ketchup and onions ? what part of only ketchup is hard to understand . then i go to the second window to pick up the order and i give it to the person i bought it for and it has cheese . which the person is allergic to processed cheese . perfect . always an issue , nothing is ever right . save yourself time and go somewhere else
american	i 'll pay the super exorbitant high prices just to get my fix . the maine lobster roll combo is the only way to go here . --- feb , 2017 : lobster me has lost it 's appeal . now i just find the $ 20 plus tiny maine lobster roll overpriced and tasteless . either the cooks have change or the lobster has .
american	always atleast a 20 min wait ( no matter time ) and stale bread --- i 'm very disappointed for the amount of time i had to wait--- i wouldn 't mind if it was fresh fast food but my pretzel bun is always stale ---- either hire more people or build a larger work environment--- warm springs sonic sucks
american	the food is just ok for the price be careful what you order . also seems that there is a very different dress code for men vs. women , ok for the women to where jeans and tank top but not the men ? ? the hostess always seem to be overwhelmed and there is a wait with empty tables . the daily specials run out very quick as they never seem to make enough .. overall they don 't care about return customers just taking advantage of the visitors . not the best value by far .
american	possibly the best in the city but always the worst service . always getting lip , long waits and eye rolls . starting to think thats part of the ambience . their just missing serving me on a pie dish plate and a couple curse word insults .
american	not one server will treat you the way you should be treated , they 're not rude they just seem not to care at all . i waited 15 minutes for my food to be corrected , 15 minutes for the check , 15 more minutes for a box. this was when the place was slow , too . the food is usually mediocre , fine when you 're hungover but not somewhere to go if you 're looking to wisely spend your money .
american	prices are too high for what you get and the suave waiter model-esq guys are overly friendly and flirtatious . may work for ladies night or swingers parties but not for couples who 's looking for a simple evening to dine . we won 't be going back here .
american	had lunch yesterday with some friends , i ordered the grilled cheese and had hopes it would be delicious . it was anything but that , i was so disappointed ! in addition to the disappointing meal , all three orders were cold when they got to the table . cold cream of mushroom soup is the worst . my friend sent it back and it was warmer , but you could tell it was congealed when it hit the table . it was a $ 70 lunch for 3 . not worth $ 15 for all 3 dishes . so sad , i loved this place . probably will not be back .
american	it seems as if the server was in a hurry to get us on the way as quickly as possible . what a rush ! the crudites were being wisked away as soon as they were placed on the table . the twice baked potato was not homemade . won 't consider going back in the near future . there are too many good restaurants out there to consider this one !
american	same really goes for the sandwiches and soups . just average and the quality of meats is always hit or miss . sometimes you get nice , lean roast beef . next time its full of fat and gristle . anytime i 've ever ventured toward something like pastrami , it 's been just a bunch of fat on a bun for the most part . ick . really , as i think about it , jason 's is pretty much 1 star for food but , they do a nice job of handling the crush of people and getting the average food out pretty quickly so , 1 seemed a bit too severe for a holistic rating .
american	the rude kid tried to short me 5 dollars and then he said i must have lost it but he swore he gave it too me . someone came and gave me my missing 5 dollars . my brother who is a manager at a cookout said they should have broken the register down . i 'm never coming back to this cookout again
american	wnt in last night and was very disappointed . first of all , our waitress was not friendly at all but did tell us that the wings my husband ordered were going to take awhile . apparently , everyone dining in ordered wings . when the garlic knots came out , the were overcooked and it seemed as if they rushed the wings as they were hard and burnet underneath all of the sauce they smothered on . this experience has led us to the decision that we will not come here anymore . it was terrible .
american	the majority of the wait staff are either unintelligent , look filthy , are uninterested or all of the above . the few times i 've gone ( because friends want to watch a game there ) the food has come out wrong and had to be sent back . one word : gross !
american	when you walk in it can take up to 10min before you are greeted . for my experience it is rare to even have a greeter at the front . also to top it off once you finally get service in this dingy place they get orders wrong , cold wings just overall horrible . i would recommend wings stop , bdubs used to be my favorite
american	i simply ordered a soup with a side ceasar salad and i got a balsamic vinaigrette mixed salad . also the only reason i came here is because panera was closed so i will be going back to panera next time it is open !
american	having said that .... not impressed with the pickle ! food was below standard ... i ordered the chicken pizza with sun-dried tomatoes and fresh rosemary . first of all , no rosemary , secondly it came out wet ! my crust was a soggy mess .... definitely not worth the price , or my time for a repeat visit .
american	disappointed ! every bite was pure salt ! had the mushroom burger , turkey burger and truffle fries . it all tasted the same ... salty ! giving 2 stars for good service only !
american	always excited to try new places .. we decided to try east coast eats. menu offered so much ... too much we didn 't know what to order. we ended up getting the steak bomb. basically a philly cheesesteak. it was loaded with meat and looked really good. took one bite and it was so bland and flavorless. we ended up getting upset stomachs later that night ... never again .
american	experience this week was a repeat of what happened in february . went to omelet station and there was one person there who 's omelet was being prepared . preparer was engaged in conversation and chose to ignore my self and the 2 people who joined the line behind me . i just gave up and walked away , and as i was in another line , i looked over and the woman behind me walked away as well . same thing happened on last visit , could this be the same guying ignoring the line ? bad attitude , just ignoring customers like that .
american	processed small strips are what they call the tenders .... its been over 4 times my order has been wrong and have learned my lesson that this location isn 't the one . also you 'd assume people want at least one butter and or honey for their biscuit
american	used the tapingo app to get a grilled cheese with grilled onions , which was an extra 50 cents and it didn 't have anything but cheese ! didn 't notice until i was halfway across campus , ridiculous honestly .
american	i sat at the bar area and my service was not as usual . the waitress took for ever to bring my change ! very frustrating ! i has to find her just so i could go back to work .
american	the servers and cashiers act as a cohesive unit . this is the best location --- some of the other locations could learn from this store . new review june 29 , 2016 really disappointing . they have turned over the entire staff . we use to have a lovely greeting by terri , along with our servers joanne and richard and mckenzie .... they are all gone do to changes in management . we have limited our visits ( as it is convenient to our home ) but are in search of another place . so sad that the good vibe and feeling welcome have been lost with these management changes
american	i have a family that lives in socal and it a must to take my son and family to have a great time . but when my family and i went last weekend it was crazy packed. everything is just 15 minutes wait . but i must say they need to open at least one more location is either southwest area or southeast . for a better service and satisfy everyone needs .
american	the chicken breasts were the size of the buffalo wings . make sure you check your order before you leave .
american	i 'm willing to pay more for organic food , but who knows how they are handled ... prob won 't return again .
american	when there is a sports game on , food takes long , i could have cared less about the hour wait , but when the waitress openly argues over what you ordered and then tries to charge you for it , well , that sums it up . manager just said he knows she has an attitude ... way to be proactive sad thing was , the girl she was training was great and was trying hard - won 't ever be back
american	but i understand that perhaps they ordered something that 's just thrown on a plate with little effort , not this time . 45 minutes later and seeing multiple people ( that were seated at least 20 minutes after us ) getting a simple burger same as we ordered , our burger arrived , it was not edible , it clearly was sitting at the pass for some time . fries were ice cold , bun was dried out and the sauce had soaked deep into it making it impossible to hold . i give one star because they didn 't charge us . it sucks because we always go there and it 's been good , may give them another shot we 'll see .
american	just relocated to a new area and went here as it 's close to my new house . first experience was absolutely horrible , the service was the worst i 've ever experienced mainly due to a gentleman named anthony who was rude and dismissive . i want to start my day off with a nice cup of coffee and a friendly experience . i was not happy with how my coffee came out and anthony offered no solution to remedy my experience . i will not be back .
american	however , this trip was different . we were there on sunday evening . our waitress scared the crap out of us . she was a crack head that was so strung out , we were constantly afraid of things being dumped in our laps . she was friendly and tried real hard , however , she was scary . she couldn 't stand still , couldn 't stand in one place for over 10 seconds . her arms were waving out of control and she was all over the place . the food was so-so . who ever heard of putting garlic toast under a hot turkey sandwich . yech . disappointing to say the least .
american	the only reason they get my business once in a while is to bring my six-year-old to the playplace . most mcdonald 's suck , but this one is truly one of the worst .
american	i even called ahead of time for 5 pizzas and they were not even done . they acted as if they knew nothing about it after the guy on the phone told me he would get started on the order .
american	always an excuse with that group . no follow up etc . very poorly run kfc . by far the worst i have ever experienced . i also prefer my chicken to be plucked before being served it ... overall very gross and very poor customer service .
american	.. so many people walked out today . missed out on so much money .. poor business . every cook jokes around never serious about their job very sad
american	the other great value wash the steak and egg 's for $ 5.99 now thats gone ! ! ! ! ! the prices are now ridiculous ! ! ! i 'm not a cheap skate at all but i can 't justify paying $ 14.99 for a three egg omelet thats half ass good ! ! i 've lived in vegas a long time this place was packed all the time years ago and you walk by it now and its not even half full . so sad won 't get my business any more !
american	but $ 12 for a dog and a lemonade ? that 's pricey . i could 've found a cheaper item at the 24 / 7 cafe down the casino for a sit down meal .
american	still lived up to that tonight . next time though , stay away from sitting at the bar . had to listen to a college aged drinker use the f-word over 20 times in talking with the girls behind the counter , and the injured ( broken foot ) worker that was drinking on his night off . bartender was less than helpful . had to watch another one eat her pasta from behind the counter until she explained " this pasta is disgusting " to which the injured worker replied .... " this place is disgusting . " lovely guys ...... keep it up .
american	this morning i was told there was a 30-40 minute wait , after standing at the hostess table for several minutes while the hostess scribbled on a dry erase pad . there were lots of empty tables , but we still couldn 't be seated . won 't be going back for brunch . also parking sucks .
american	the other night it missed big time , had the rib eye , $ 50 steak tasted terrible , the truffle mac and cheese was so so , and the service was fair . just like mastro 's over priced and not that great . go to ruth chris , it never varies .
american	today 's experience was a disappointment for these reasons : after being seated right away , took forty-five minutes to get meal ; waitperson was not too interested in her job ( " what kind of beer ? well , i 'll figure it out . " ; never offered a soft drink refill ; never said a word when setting drinks on table ; never said thank you when placing bill on table ) . meal was three stars , having easily been four or five in the past . we have purchased gift cards for family members in the past , but will probably discontinue that .
american	this will be a real quick review , not some long winded piece of too much information . service wasn 't very good . 2 out of 3 burgers came out wrong . sent one of them back twice because they didn 't believe ( or couldn 't believe ) that is wasn 't prepared as ordered . bad way to start off a first time visit . the fries , in my opinion , were too limp and not crispy enough for my tastes . the burgers were actually good , tasty meat and good quality buns but my 2 start rating is because the whole experience wasn 't very good .
american	i went recently to find out the one and only decent item has been discontinued ! ? the spicy chicken biscuit of all things ! ? come on : ( unfortunately i have no more business to do here
american	i ordered it medium and it was so rare the blood was squeezing out of it . i took it to go and didn 't want to bring it back . i should have complained , i even took a picture of it but i just pulled the meat out of the bun a nuked it . very disappointed .
american	food was good and server was pleasant but food took 25 minutes with only 5 tables occupied on a saturday afternoon . table was sticky and remained so even after cleaning . floors had debris and restrooms were the worst i have seen . makes me worried about the kitchen . we will never return .
american	to start with the cups the water was served in were filthy when asked for new cups those cups were filthy , also the manager informed us the filter was dirty the water was coming from . the salad bar was filthy with eggs and cheese inside of the salad dressings they were substituting bologna for the ham . and then it got worse the meal came 45 minutes later with completely raw bacon served on top of the chicken sandwich . it was obviously a filthy badly managed establishment . our waitress however was a sweetheart .
american	however today was miss informed about brunch and happy hour prices from one server to another during shift change and was given attitude about it when given the bill . so sad about this because i have always had excellent service here before . especially with a large group of us .
american	i had the classic breakfast , nothing too fancy , eggs , sausage , potatoes , upgraded to the biscuit ( was really excited ) . my biscuit was cold , flaky and almost undercooked . my eggs were fine . my potatoes were flavourless and a bit hard . my friend ordered the scrambled eggs and it was runny ( had to return it because she was pregnant and ordered scrambled eggs for a reason ) . service was good , the servers were a bit scattered but attentive . i was really looking forward to trying this place ! maybe they had an off day ?
american	last three times i 've been there they were out of cajun fries , onion rings and then po boy bread ! how the heck do you run out of po boy bread by 1 pm on a saturday ? they open at 10 and close at 11 .... they still have 10 hours of business . that 's a lot of time to not be able to serve one of the main things on your menu . will not return here again . waste of time . my guess is if i were to go again , they 'd be out of chicken by 11 am .
american	probably because pittsburgher 's love greasy hoagies . if that 's what you 're into , then you 'll probably love this place too . not my cup of tea . i ordered one of the " ligther " options and it was still full of grease and it left me with a nasty stomach ache .
american	limited beer selection , food is dependably decent . 2 stars for food , 3 for drinking !
american	the atmosphere is always better than the coffee or the service but i just can 't stay away .
american	so busy that it put me off , but , finally , dined here last night . pros : found a parking spot even though it was quite packed . quick service and empty tables even though the parking lot was busy . cons : grilled chicken salad with fries atop not all that special . ranch dressing pretty bland . extensive beer menu only does one good if they actually remember to bring the beer . for whatever reason , beer not brought and not charged . too many options exist to want to revisit .
american	this is one of those " if you 're not a regular , get the hell outta here " kinda bars . food is straight from the freezer , onto your plate . service leaves much to be desired ( unless you 're a regular , then you 're treated like royalty ) . only gets a 2nd star because the place looks nice and is clean . for the most part ... stay away !
american	the serve overpriced bar food and the service is terrible . after you check in with no wait , you have to wait in line to check in . the entire process is haphazard at best and malicious at worst .
american	we were greeted right away and seated right away . our waitress was very nice and took our order of eggs over medium , an omelet and coffees . coffee came quickly ( weak ) followed by the food shortly thereafter . after having a few bites of the eggs , potatoes and toast we both agreed it was nothing special and we could get this breakfast anywhere . it wasn 't bad . we just weren 't impressed with the food or the atmosphere . had to look for the waitress to get coffee refills and had to get up and find her to get the check . probably wont be back .
american	tonight i asked for mild tenders ... pretty standard stuff . " don 't have any . " no offer to make any . i said i wasn 't going to order anything then . " ok cool . have a good night . " they always forget something when we order here , but we come because popeyes has good chicken . my fat butt needs to diet anyways ... guess god put these employees here to give me proper motivation to stop eating fried food . seriously though , this particular location just needs to fire it 's whole staff and rehire some people that might actually like working .
american	always slow , never gets my order right , and never fails i always get a stale big mac
american	even at lunch . foods overpriced for diner quality . clean . owner , dave , is around sometimes and will say hi .
american	workers are short tempered with children in a fast food joint with a kid 's play area . manager yelled at my daughter not to play with the door when she was simply trying to open it . the play area is the only reason we go here . this time we got yelled at for nothing . last time we tried to come the play area was locked at 5 : 45 pm . we 'll be skipping this spot and heading 5 mins further down the road to cleaner , friendlier , kid friendly places .
american	waited about 20 minutes to take our drink order . not even an apology , i asked for a manager and was told one was not available . since it 's a holiday they don 't honor specials , but their signs out front say every sunday . food is okay , not worth the price .
american	( worst wait times in brampton ) always wrong . but still tastes like mcdonalds . : )
american	have had pizza be under cooked . always feel like a rushed pizza was thrown together and not properly made . have complained multiple times and hope this franchise gets new owners or management !
american	decent brew and food though . they dont make fried zucchini anymore but had fried pickles that were delish although a small portion
american	it seems they 're understaffed . food was and is always decent but there was a hair in my fries . science shows staph bacteria can be found in hair . and that just went into my mouth . thankfully they gave me a new fry
american	we placed a large order at work for delivery and almost 2 hours later ( 4miles away ) when it arrived all the 8 of us who ordered could say is wow ! this is horrible ! ! ! everything dry and burnt except the wings that were 1 not smoked , and 2 were undercooked .. i will say the sauces were good but the meats were horrible , burnt , dry , just nasty .. do not recommend ! we threw away more than we ate .. drive another 5 min and go to pittsburgh bbq ! you will thank me !
american	total disappointment . food is always bad and never looks like the menu . this is the last time we will be at applebee 's . oh and they no longer have " riblets " why would you get rid of the one thing that put you on the map .
american	but if you like deep fried well then it 's darn tasty cheers
american	bought a full meal that looked as if it had been sitting out for hours . i 've been to quite a few mcdonald 's in my life time and it 's safe to say this has been the worst . i 've given it a few chances given its convenient location , disappoints me even more every time .
american	boy was i disappointed . ! ! ! made a reservation , yet to sit in the patio area , we had to wait an additional 30 mins . when we were finally seated , i questioned the wait time as there were plenty of open tables . now our waiter wasn 't horrible but he wasn 't the greatest . we had to call him over to get his attention several times . overall food was overpriced and was mediocre and i was so disappointed that i didn 't even get dessert . lets just say we will never be back !
american	lobster bisque was bland , no seasoning ... gumbo was so undercooked the shrimp jumped in my water glass ! absolutely no seasoning , bartender warned me that people complain about it having no spice ... that was an understatement ... now lets talk about the lobster rolls ... brioche buns are great , but when you pretoast them and leave them under a heat lamp it tends to ruin it . the mixture itself was bland .. again .. seems to be in the normal scheme of things .. anyway , after a monumental disappointing lunch , i 'm gonna head to the room for a nap . 3 am came way too early !
american	didn 't know of the change in ownership and was surprised last night . dar ordered the catfish and i the usual fish fry . waiting time was average but few customers and no entertainment . food arrived and we couldn 't believe the size of dar 's order , so small it wasn 't hardly an appetizer . mine was huge , i gave her 1 / 2 a piece of mine but neither of us like the beer batter seasoning and didn 't each all of it . the bright side , they got rid of the so called " service dogs " which in a lot of cases is false . overall we won 't be back .
american	gross . i love subway but i turn around when i saww this person working and head over to jersey mike 's .
american	beautiful mall by the way . this restaurant is very very very expensive . my personal recommendation is don 't order rack of lamb well done . it comes out inedible as punishment for liking well done . i have made and ate well done rack of lamb all over the world . never has a restaurant cooked it in such a way that a knife could not cut it at all . service was great though . my husbands steak just ok . butter cake was wonderful though . we would not return . much much better restaurants in vegas .
american	thanks , but i think i will stick to restaurants who don 't need me to complain to a manager in order to get good service .
american	amateur service , high prices , long wait times .
american	amazed i could taste my food after sitting in the stench of cigarette smoke in the restaurant .
american	amazing atmosphere and bar staff , horrible waiter and overpriced food ... coming from a local
american	but the food leaves much to be desired . we had ribs and filet - $ 60 meal . ribs had great flavor , but definitely lacking in meat . filet was one of the worst steaks i 've ever eaten . i seriously struggled to cut it without making a scene shaking my plate , let alone chew it . i have never had a filet cut ( cooked medium ) that was so tough . maybe the tacos and burgers are better ! avoid steaks and ribs .
american	but the servers ... what a bunch of uppity whippersnappers . the staff is killing this place . they 're a bunch of stuck-up , unfriendly , poseurs . the hostess was incredibly rude , like she 's doing us a favor by seating us . and the tragic , beardy , hipster child that was our server was a total a $ $ hole . another one who was doing us favors by deigning to wait on us . save the attitude and bring what i ordered . and seriously , i know it 's canada , but can 't i just order a pint of beer ? what the f is 375 ml of beer ? silliness . nope .
american	amazing chicken ceaser salad with warm fresh chicken , but unfortunately their protein shakes are absolutely horrible , and their cheese they use is cheap and feels like i 'm chewing on a pier of melted rubber
american	really ... it is incredible that we would have others seated before us then told we were not large enough for the open table so they could make more money go elsewhere if you wanted to be treated well
american	i called on a monday to reserve a table on thursday by the window since i had an out of town guest with me . i thought it would be nice to overlook the lake with a view of downtown . i was told those seats were 1st come , 1st served . i would think that a call on monday for dinner on thursday would qualify as " 1st come . " would i suggest this restaurant based on customer service ? ? ... probably not !
american	poor poor service ! had to continuously ask for things ie . utensils not at table , refills , syrup . saw our waitress once and the other waitress only served her tables didn 't bother checking to see if we wanted more coffee when she was already out there . very unfortunate for what seemed to be cool place .
american	worst bartending service , doesn 't matter what time i come in , always disappointed .
american	terrible service . the hostess was not nice at all , and we waited for over 30 min to even go inside and the place was not even close to being half full . our waitress was very nice , but it took a very long time to even be helped . this one does not even compare to the one in ny .
american	but wow did this one suck . i 've seen my " crab legs and taquitos playing in my mashed potatos " before ... but don 't remember the last time it sucked so bad .
american	my wife said the bathrooms need immediate and thorough cleaning and restocking of supplies . the only positive was our waitress , winter .
american	staff were very friendly and fairly prompt . someone got me coffee and water right away . the waitress was very helpful in determining how i should have my eggs cooked ( i asked for over easy and she suggested over medium if i wanted the whites cooked ) and prompt with service . the food was quite underwhelming . eggs were cooked as requested but hash browns were not cooked all the way and tasteless . sausage was okay but kind of bland . cheapest meal on the menu at $ 15 dollars and $ 4 for coffee . seems that at those prices it should be awesome ! but i guess that 's vegas .
american	the canned portobello mushrooms are a disgrace to such a good product . i have also ordered mandarin oranges before that were spoiled .
american	they fill their fruit bowls & soups not even half way up the cup . the service is not that great either from the few times i 've visited this location .
american	but ... i 'd never had smoked meat and thought it was going to be all of my dreams come true . i was expecting something like pastrami or roast beef , but more flavorful . what we got - both on the house special poutine and the signature sandwich - was lukewarm , slimy , fatty , and completely devoid of texture . i cannot honestly say that i enjoyed my meal . but perhaps smoked meat isn 't for me .
american	slow slow slow and it took us 45 and 5 tmrw to finally get our checks . too bad because the space is truly great . get it together please !
american	sadly a waste . been here twice ... everything i 've had was either " meh " or just not good . i 've had disco fries , lobster mac and cheese , peculiar rabbit burger , their deviled eggs , and their version of lamb shwarma . food is eh , service is mediocre , venue is great .... but what are you to do .
american	been wanting to check this place out ever since i moved in across the road . disappointing ! despite it being virtually empty , the service was atrocious . bartender + kitchen staff were gossiping and joking the entire time . food was dry ( okay , fine , you don 't come here for the food , but still ) . i 'd suggest you do a 180 and turn around !
american	my friend once ordered a salad here . the menu indicated it would have cheese . it arrived without cheese . she sent it back and they brought it back out with a kraft american single ripped apart and laid on the top . i wish i was joking . great place to grab a miller lite and enjoy the view after playing volleyball at whiskey island . if you 're looking for good food or drink , avoid like it 's the plague .
american	but the dinner service was terrible and the food was ordinary . the shrimp cocktail was billed as fantastic but was boring . the asparagus was overcooked and the chicken was dry and no better than something i cook at home for my kids . the halibut main course was no better . we were a group of 6 and gratuity was automatically added to our very large bill , although we had to beg our waiter for everything through the evening . the pomegranate mojitos are yummy , though at $ 16 per cocktail is wasn 't that special . save your winnings and go somewhere else .
american	i live in toronto and i just wanted to enjoy the view of our city on my birthday . i knew the food wasn 't going to be michelin star standard but the service and quality of food made it difficult to have an enjoyable experience . just way below standard for the price they are asking . they kept on pushing deserts on us . we were just ready to leave .
american	sit at the bar ! great country music , deals for wings and beer were excellent . probably the worst service i have ever received . the waitress even made an expression when she saw our table sit down . we had to go get our own napkins , ordered a second round before we were half way done with beers-because we knew it would be a longer than normal wait . save yourself the hassle , sit at the bar . i would have given 4-5 stars if service was actually decent .
american	however , the food was below sub par . our portebello mushroom appetizer was nothing to write home about and my boyfriend described his stuffed chicken and risotto to taste like " lemon pledge . " i had the halibut which was definately not fresh fish and awefully bland and the sauce seemed starchy and blah . for what we paid it didn 't seem worth it .
american	not much in cleveland offers this . food is very good , with lots of options . service is notoriously awful and indifferent which can ruin an experience quickly unfortunately .
american	our group of 8 was not impressed . the bar area was overlapping into the restaurant area and many bar patrons were inappropriately standing next to where we sat . we 've been to opus 3 times and still no improvement .
american	food was delicious but service was awful . bartender told us we needed to be quiet and we 're disturbing people ... there was literally no one next to us . we were there for 3 birthday 's at once and spent so much $ $ on food and drinks . immediately ruined the vibe , doucheb 's . it 's friday night and we 're at the bar , get off your high horse .
american	but it all goes down hill from there ! went twice just to give them a second shot ! i had the wilcox burger ' not much flavor and it was $ 17.00 also ordered the southern fried chicken and it was not cooked . waitress told me it was their brining process !
american	fish tacos & burgers and some salads . definitely was expecting something a little more varied , like l 'entrepôt or other similar fixed price restos . came on a sunday night when they are supposed to close at 11.30-12 and although not many tables were going , they do last call for food at 10.45pm. to boot , the kitchen staff start cleaning and start blaring mega hard-core music that overpowers the music of the resto itself . definitely left me wanting more ..
american	food is terrible . i didn 't say $ 60 + for decor and comfortable chairs . it 's such a shame because i heard so many good things about this buffet ... ho my godd .
american	not very good ambiance for fine dining . server was absolutely terrible , barely knew the menu and had no idea about wine . there was nobody in the restaurant that knew anything about the wine . we had planned on spending hundreds of dollars on nice wine pairings , but without a sommier there , we passed on wine all together which was very frustrating . the server seemed like she was new and spent most of her time hanging out at the hostess stand chatting . luckily , the food was delicious so that made up for the bad ambiance and bad service. i would say there are much better choices in vegas and would never dine here again based upon this experience .
american	they have a limited menu . the pretzel bites came out burnt , the queso that accompanied it wasn 't melted but rather a clump of gooey cheese . the food we ordered came out cold and the service was so painfully slow ! ! ! we definitely won 't be going there for the food ever again , just the patio when the weather is nicer .
american	came in with 4 friends , everyone 's order was wrong but mine . sign said they closed at 8pm , we got there at 7 and the barista was more worried about my pastry being on a real plate instead of a " to go " plate because they were about to close . my friends drinks took a good 10 minutes and they were wrong . will not be returning .
american	i think it 's sad they passed it off as a filet . calamari was ok , martini was eh . like i said filets weren 't really filets and the chocolate cake tasted like it was defrosted and then served .. nothing to brag about and definitely won 't be returning ; (
american	the salad was simple , small without any special signature that should in that expensive stake house . all in all , pass on this restaurant .
american	i would have rated it 4 or 5 stars but several of our courses ( appetizer and entrees ) were way too salty . i do not know what it is about chefs these days but they need to learn that less is more . food would have been great with much less salt . not sure i would return . just not healthy or tasty .
american	customer service good . buffet fair : pizza crust was hard on all their combinations price does reflect quality food . suggestions : improve crust and have ice tea available .
american	nothing more . 15-17 bucks for a sandwich burger or wrap . showed up cold , bland and soggy . good for kids . thats it .
american	ambiance of the place is good , pizza is average and pasta tastes like canned food.this is place is ok to hang arnd for drinks .
american	my wife ordered the shrimp caesar salad and only received 4 shrimp for $ 26 . the sautéed mushrooms included with steak entrees is misinformation , only included 3 mushrooms . the service was polite but very slow . the bottle of wine was the highlight of dinner . in the end , i would never recommend this restaurant .
american	tasteful and fun italian themed interior . service : attentive , friendly . price : $ 12 and up food : assortment of authentic italian dishes , focus on pasta . the cannelloni marinara was good , the sauce and cannelloni appeared both homemade . the house rosé refreshing and well chosen . summary : a simple pasta dish together with a house wine and cannoli came to close to $ 30 for lunch . a diet coke rang up $ 4 after tax and tip . ludicrously overpriced . the take out counter should not be avoided , the restaurant on the other hand , can be quietly ignored .
american	just a typical american / canadian food . nothing amazing about it . this is an example of a fancy restaurant , with expensive price but ordinary food .
american	typical " trendy " to rest tho . food was good . service was horrible ! waited , and waited for the server to come to our table ( a good 15 minutes ) . drinks took way too long to arrive . food service was quick however , but the server didn 't check on us after we got our meals . and he took too long to bring us our second round of drinks . there are much better patios with better service in this city . if it wasn 't for the food , against the grain would be getting a big fat f from me !
american	my salad was good , but the flatbread was a cheap knock off of warmed up pita bread with low quality ingredients that did not match what the menu said . the sandwich wrap we ordered was lunch meat and buffalo sauce ( not good at all ) . fries and drinks were good . this was our 3rd visit - the first two visits were a couple years ago under different management and the service was horrible . we decided to try one more time and this time it was better , but the food was not up to standards . probably won 't be back at all .
american	i waited 20 minutes for my hot tea after asking twice . my frend ordered the ny strip and he was brought a ribeye . he ordered a scotch and it came with a sno-cone amount of ice ... ! ! ! when the waiter replaced his drink , it was obvious that the bartender had just dumped the now watered-down scotch into a new glass . food was good , but not the best . for a similar price point , i 'd go to ruth 's chris or maestros .
american	the watermelon soup starter was below average , the salads were good , the meat dishes were horrible , the chocolate cake was good , but the key lime pie was lacking ( it also had pop rocks on it ) . all in all , pass on this restaurant . for the price point , you are better off going to del fresco , n9ne , or ruth chris . the sauces for the protein dishes ( ny strip , pulled beef , bass ) were border line disgusting . needless to say , i will never go back nor recommend this restaurant to anyone in the future .
american	food was just ok and overpriced . server was great . food took forever to come . would not eat here again .
american	the food was meh ( the braised wagyu on hashbrown was great though ) but the dessert was better . tried all kinds and my favorite has to be the rhubarb and the crepes . for me , the price of wasn 't really worth the quality , won 't be coming back .
american	as far as the service it could have been more efficient but the food was good although i could taste that it was not home made . as a culinarian it is obvious when a restaurant uses a tremendous amount of canned product and artificial ingredients . with that being said , for the over 60 year old clientele that they are providing for , it must be a hit . i hope that the rest of the local community that has a palate for real food won 't have a problem eating good food made with artificial ingredients .
american	the food is good , but what i had in particular was very poorly made . eggs benedict is really sour , i have no idea why . when i took a bite , i thought it was rotten . i didn 't get sick , so i think it was just the flavor . the potatoes are good though .
american	that 's about all i can say positive about this place . it 's very pricey ( one chicken breast is $ 5 ) . for the amount of money you pay , i would expect a little more flavor ( doesn 't seem like they season the chicken before they batter it ) so remember to bring your salt and pepper shakers with you .
american	service from kitchen extremely poor , 40 mins between appetizer and main ! then one meal , pork served almost defrosted raw - reheated to edible but the moment had passed . apologies insincere . go for atmosphere but not for service or food .
american	service meh , i realize we were a large group but when a server comes over with a tray of coffee and says " who wants one " - well no . i had tuna ( $ 29 ) asked for it rare got it medium well - food was very salty . the calamari were ok . the ginormous kids portions are a joke as were the regular pasta portions - seriously how much food do you throw away at the end of the night ? the cesar salad wilted and not good , the pasta romanoff was gloopy and very peppery according to the person who ordered it . the mussels looked good . not good value for your money .
american	we were seated quickly on a saturday night . food however very disappointing . the " belgium " fries were soggy and pizza was cold and doughy . we spoke to manager and he didn 't seem to care . come for the beer and atmosphere but not the food .
american	they have a good menu for after hours 1.99 ordered everything on the menu , and did not serve all of our food had to complain to manager . the manager all of a sudden said that we had all of it , we accounted for the orders and it was 4 orders short ! ! ! did not like the experience there at all .
american	i ordered the hot smoked salmon omelette and was really disappointed by it . it was very plain . just omelette , cheese and salmon . as a result of that , the taste was just plain . if you come here pls stay away from the omelettes .
american	seated right away . terrible service . food took about 40 minutes and all we ordered was a salad and a bison burger . the salad was like a whole 16 ounce bag of spinach with 1 clementine orange , cranberries , and a small amount of mozzarella . the bison burger which has an egg on it was somehow dry . very disappointed . after such a long wait , you would think a manager would come out to apologize or anything for that matter .
american	i felt like i was sitting in a cafeteria . the food was rather bland and it kind of felt like i was an old person in a rest home on a specialty diet . i spoke to the management and there did not seem to be any concern at all . she said " that 's the way they always do it . " i ordered the lasagna and i believe the commercial product " mrs. stouffers lasagna " would 've been much better flavor . my wife had chicken marcella and that was equally bland . after four forkfuls each , we left the rest of the dinner paid the bill and left . would we return ? not a chance in the world !
american	i switched harkins which is arizona owned . i will give up a recliner any day to support locally owned businesses . peace out amc .
american	whatever it is they are putting out on those warming tables , i 'm not sure that you should call it pizza !
american	the selection of items is ordinary and consists of several unhealthy choices . service is good , but is far better than the food served . it is not impossible to have a chain restaurant which serves good food . panera , cheesecake factory and chili 's are examples .
american	in the coleslaw . went on a saturday afternoon and it was really noisy .someone in the back was dropping pans and doors were being slammed shut . not usual for this place . had the zucchini panini . it was good . no grill marks on the panini . cheese was melted ok . let down
american	came on a not terribly busy sunday night , and somehow ended up with one waiter taking care of us primarily , and a second waiter coming over after we had ordered appetizers to ask us about ordering food , and when i replied that we had ordered but then clarified that we hadn 't ordered dinner yet , he became exasperated . the appetizers came out at the same time as our burgers ( which we did receive apologies for ) , which were all cooked to a medium rare ( at most ) despite 2 of 3 of us ordering them more well-done . the shrimp with the shrimp and grits appetizer was unseasoned and over-cooked . not sure i 'll be back anytime soon .
american	awful service , and warm disgusting beer was the special of the day . we walked out after our server forgot we were there . will never go back to this hole - there are much better options in this city . walk a block in any direction to find one .
american	attended the mother 's day brunch last year and it was amazing . this year we were very disappointed . we booked on line and when we arrived we 're told that the buffet didn 't start for another hour . we then ordered off the menu and waited for 45 min while staff walked past us with tray after tray of food for the buffet . our breakfast was underwhelming and about on par with what you get at a sunset grill . we won 't be back .
american	america : if you search " healthy restaraunts " in cornelius , nc in yelp , mcdonald not only comes up , it 's # 7 !
american	popular with the morbidly obese and screaming children . overpriced . stay well clear .
american	american deli food is so good i will buy wing tray for superbowl love american deli and philly cheesesteak is so good
american	rubber bacon , smallest link sausage i ever saw . eggs cold english muffin not toasted beverages not kept full . no silverware no napkins , bathrooms were not clean . seriously nobody had it together . i should have went to another place and waited but i fasted for a blood test . the water was good when we got it . so darn expensive for so little food . dirty place do not suggest eating here anytime soon . probably the last time i go to denny 's . my wife 's food was spicy and bacon was rubbery as well . granddaughter didn 't like her nuggets . sad very sad . oh p.s a whopping 34 bucks for such a horrible meal .
american	americanized russian food with no alcohol , atmosphere is bland , and service was only okay
american	pretty good sized burger , but not amazing taste . was decent . tomato was tiny . sweet potato fries were just ok . i 've had way better . they were a little cold and seemed like they were about 1-2 hours old good selection of beers if you aren 't spoiled by the northwest like i am
american	for a side i ordered the 1 / 2 fries and 1 / 2 rings combo . what i received was a small basket of fries with 3 onion rings . being they were charging as much as a side of onion rings i was expecting a little bit more . for the same or a little more money i 'd go the extra 1 / 2 mile and eat at nom nom burger .
american	i 'd give one star but the loaded baked potato was decent ( the bacon was the only low point of the potato as it was pretty fatty ) . great steak is am embarrassment to america and they should be stripped of their slogan ! unfortunately this part of the terminal doesn 't have much to offer for food so they have a captive audience .
american	omg .... the service is horrible ! .. it took forever to get drinks , food ... anything ! ( no matter who you ordered from ) . the food was also terrible . the best thing i had was a decent martini . the kicker was that the " special event menu " is more expensive than the regular menu and is very limited even though the event was not private . wow ! the manager was not empathetic ... will not be returning .
american	place was bustling , we waited a litle bit for a table , not a problem . service was very good and attentive and super pleasant . food was truly mediocre at best . simple burger was just a plain ole patty with bacon on it , fries were greasy ... salad was .... just ok . overall . i wouldnt wait 35 mins again for this place , but dont get the burger . not a freshly ground burger ... just a frozen patti and quite boring . friends had the lobster dip with nachos and said itnwas very good . just dont get the whole wood thing when nothing tasted like it was wood smoked .... ? ? ? ?
american	had 2 beers , instead . get a quality chef in that joint for fuck 's sake . what a shame ...
american	loud sports tv being broadcast in the bar where we waited and sipped the expected overpriced-yet-average wine . we were led to a table in a far corner from which we could view the delivery door being opened and closed . then our waiter , who had either no training or the worst sense of timing ever , strolled by to take our order after we 'd been waiting , oh , 15 minutes or so . the food was bland , arrived haphazardly , was cold more often than not ... you get the idea . and when we were ready for the check ? you guessed it -- another 15 minute wait . i cannot fathom the appeal of this place .
american	went there because we had tickets to a show nearby . we left plenty of time . when we checked in with the hostess , she said it would be a 30-45 min. wait to sit outside by the water . i gave my name . after 50 min . i went inside only to be told it would be at least another 15 min. wait . we couldn 't wait that long so we opted for an inside table . we were then seated at a table with no silverware , no waitress and ultimately no food . a miserable experience . i would never go back and neither should you .
american	we planned one " good meal " stop on our 12 hr drive . when we saw " amish buffet , " everyone agreed this sounded good. so , we passed up typical fast food places to go here & ended up blowing our budget on low quality food ... even the coffee was bad . i tried seveal items on the entre line- all tasted worse than school cafeteria fod. i decided to try salad but the salad bar was very scarce in variety.very disappointing- especially for something with " amish " in the name . i doubt it is truly home-made as one would expect . we should 've gone to mcdonalds !
american	usually like texas roadhouse , but this location dose not have it together . took almost 2 hours and we ordered as soon as the waitress came to the table . long wait for bread too . my food was cold , kids chicken not cooked , fries brown ( not golden ) , shrimp was cold , ribs were tough , and the steaks were overly seasoned . sorry i brought my parents here , i guess you have to be in texas to have a good texas roadhouse experience .
american	the food was heavy and greasy . i had the bob which was not nearly as light and organic as it sounds and james had the mac and cheese which was only ok . my latte was essentially a cup of milk with some coffee in it--almost no foam . overall everything was definitely not worth the $ 30 it cost . at all . i will say that all the employees i encountered were very nice and friendly but for the food , man , i really do not recommend this place .
american	the food was cold , the service was horrible and apparently there is only one person who knows how to make a milkshake as it took over 30 minutes for us to get ours . please don 't waste your time or money here . head down to the yardhouse and enjoy a real burger / fries as well as excellent customer service . you won 't be sorry !
american	also , the service was horrible . the waitress we had acted like she had better things to do than to come over and take our order ... and it took her forever to bring us our checks . i had to be back at work by a certain time , but i got tired of waiting so i had to leave cash on the table . i will never ever waste my hard-earned money on a la-ti-da place like this again ! ain 't nobody got time ( or money ) for that !
american	i still haven 't experienced that here yet . i 've done the breakfast and the dinner . i wish i could remember what i had , but that 's how lackluster it was besides the novelty of the ridiculous size of the portions . i 've tried both locations . both are completely blah . i don 't see the allure besides presentation and the ridiculous size of the portions .
american	the over done customer service creeps me out and i am just a hater . also , the entire company is just an embarrassment .
american	i should of know from the taste . i kept slathering on theyre yucky bbq sauce to try to get it down . i 'm sure it was the chicken ... it had no smoke flavor and bland , and the only item that the others didn 't have . the smell was great outside , but the food was awful . beans are sweet ... glad we didnt have an elderly person or a child ... not worth it ! !
american	the eatery boasts name-brand appeal and some history , however , their actual product here brought some shame to the storied dog 's legend . i chose the coney island dog with fries and a soda . the hot dog was small with nothing to differentiate it from any other hot dog . the chili and onions added some flavor to it , but only elicited a " meh " from me . the fries were it 's saving grace as at least they were crispy and decent . it 's a decent option , but there are probably much better options to spend your $ 10 on .
american	after suffering through a miserable meal -- bad service , bad food , bad attitudes -- at the now-closed location at the m resort , i said i would never go back . but while in reno , , staying at harrah 's reno , i unhappily noticed that the hotel has almost no other choices , so i tried the hash house there . yuck ! ugly , multi-tattooed servers , slow service , marginally edible food . i will be glad when this sorry establishment goes out of business .
american	currently waiting over 15 minutes to even be acknowledged by wait staff . had to go up to ask for menus , which i would have thought would be a hint that we 'd like to order , but each waitress tends to other tables and ignores ours . have been here a few other times and also experienced less than stellar service .
american	i haven 't been back since . the sandwich smelled just like fish . how is it possible that a chicken sandwich could end up smelling like fish ? i complained to the manager and she didn 't show any sympathy whatsoever . she made no apologies at all . i was deeply disturbed and highly offended by her lack of customer service skills . they then took another half hour to make a new sandwich . it was the worst experience at mcdonald 's in my life .
american	amon the crappiest of all arby 's , stale bread , poorly made sandwiches and unfriendly service .
american	my first and last visit . terrible service . the food was cold maybe because we had to wait 3 - 4 minutes after it finally came to get silverware and a napkin . the waiter was rude and could care less about being there . maybe mr gaughn should rethink the service award that is displayed there . the product is inferior , steak burger ( ? ) . a $ 4.75 milk shake that had chunks of ice in it ! all in all a really bad experience , but as i said i will not go back !
american	our meals were on par with an average level of quality one might reasonably expect from a mid-range steakhouse . i have no objection to paying an exorbitant amount for a great meal , but this restaurant has no place in any discussion regarding the " best of vegas . " i have been to better places both at and well below the price point . if you value branding over quality , by all means proceed .
american	for starters , we had a reservation and it still took us 40 minutes ( and several inquiries ) to get our table ..... once seated , a good 10 minutes passed before our server came to our table . had to ask for water refills . the food , while good was a bit pricey ( accept for the dessert , i will say it was yummy ) sadly , i will not be returning here anytime soon .
american	a tip for the newbie : if you order a small fries , they use a small cup to fill up a brown bag of fries , and turn the cup upside down on the whole thing . if you order a large , they do the same with a large cup ( filling up the same size bag ) , for a larger price . : )
american	( yes , eight ounce ! ! ! ) steak for $ 42.00 ! ! ! the saying is true - " no one goes out of business betting against the intelligence of the american ( in this case , tourist ) population . stay away from this ripoff ! ! !
american	travel back in time to overdone meat , food swimming in sauces and yes , deep-fried calamari as an appetizer . we asked for gluten-free choices ( celiac disease , not a fad ) and have no confidence that was respected because next came a platter of crusty bread plus when they brought the battered calamari for our companion they brought plates for sharing ( no batter , no wheat , no gluten ! ! ! ) . beef was overdone , fish was in a cheap chinese restaurant red sweet sauce , lamb was " not worth $ 54 . " service was there but ... i hope the nightly trip back the the sixties in the resident time machine doesn 't harm them .
american	if you 're ears are not ringing they will be . all hard surfaces make it a giant echo chamber . the pizza was good and a good deal for $ 11 with a drink . service was good . poor cell service in this area and no wifi here while other establishments like five guys next door have wifi .
american	staff was nice and its nice that they will bring your burger to the table but the burger and fries were not at all memorable .
american	we had a large group and service was great . i had the french dip with fries . it had quite a bit of fat and the fries had been ready well before being served . if you 're in the area i wouldn 't avoid sammy 's , but i certainly would not go out of my way to get there .
american	i could have bought a steak burger for $ 10 .
american	bad customer service . waitress was rude and waited twenty minutes and still couldn 't get a proper menu to order from . i wouldn 't recommend this place unless desperate . hotel was nice , which earned the star .
american	big tvs but just ok service ... 17 minute wait with people in kitchen behind register doing absolutely nothing ... matter of fact where are they making the wings ? 10 wings in the deep fryer max 2 mins to cook shake with seasoning , done 1 min . later ..
american	as new parents we were able to sneak out a bit for date night and enjoy an uninterrupted meal . this place has been in our list do we decided to try it . took 8-10 min to get greeted , sat with empty glasses while in front of the waitstaff station and slow service . food was meh .. ok .
american	looked like harry rosen store exploded here . good for mba / business school students to observe natural environment behaviors . apparently we 're the only ones that didn 't bump into associates coming out of work . date : thursday august 9 , 2012 . yes . it was a weekday workday suitday , suit up . otherwise , reminds me of a moxie 's . chicken wings ( $ 13 ) manhattan ( $ 8 + ) 2.5'd
american	still not impressed with texas roadhouse . food was not cooked correctly again . and the service was simply awful . again i asked for a medium steak and it came out completely rare . not one ounce was pink , instead it was bright red and clearly not cooked to a medium preference . i had to search for our server after 15 minutes post food not checking in to send it back . when they brought it out , it wasn 't hot but warm but at least it was cooked . service and food seem to be going down hill hopefully it will get better soon . until then , i don 't plan on visiting for awhile ...
american	this girl had serious issues and if this is the management style then new management is needed to be replaced also . i paid for my shake , never drank it and went on my way . not sure if the owners read this but they need a serious talk with the staff of this place . feel free to contact me if you want all the issues .
american	ordered a chicken ceasar salad with no red peppers . the girl threw peppers on it and we told her we said no red peppers . so what does she do , pick them off right in front of us . so disgusting ! wow . not coming back .
american	i 'll likely not come back either . we came in this evening to get my king crab leg fix , and for $ 26 we were given two whole legs . two ! ! ! ! $ 13 a leg , basically . such crap . the shrimp we ordered was a better value for the money , however half the shrimp was mushy and there were a lot of heads without bodies in the bag . our server offered to let us talk to the manager , but the manager should have been brought over as soon as i complained the first time .
american	" it took me 40 minutes to get a sandwich here , and when i complained i didn 't get an apology , just a snarky remark " well you can see we have a small kitchen "
american	the bbq sauce they put on everything is lacking to say the least . i got the sampler and i didn 't enjoy anything too much . my girlfriend said the mac and cheese was good .
american	boots and bourbon is there now . review pending .
american	california and texas locations are perfect , but this particular one needs to get their ' ish ' together . my waiter was cool , but my mediterranean deep dish pizza was not cut properly and it was overcooked . there were advertising on tv screens and on my table of a free pizookie if a mobile app was used , and my waiter was clueless when i asked . when it finally arrived , it was a very small size and burned ! not going here again .
american	waiting in the drive thru for 20 minutes to just end up leaving because they don 't know how answer the window . fyi people rite-aid across the street accepts almost the same kinds f insurance walgreen 's does . i can 't stand this place . loathe and despise !
american	came in for a late lunch . very friendly waiter , very bad food ! i had the jambalaya . it wasn 't tasteless , it was the worst i have ever had . my wife ordered a salad she sent back , then settled on a steak . it was edible , but barely . i tried a piece , to me it tasted like liver . i guess good if you like liver . maybe the burgers are good ?
american	i was in vegas last weekend with a friend who didn 't want to miss eating there . she made a reservation for a window table many weeks in advance . the night before our planned dinner , she got a call from the restaurant asking if we planned to spend at least $ 100 per person because those are " premium " tables . at this point , i would have told them to stick their table but she said yes . so we ate there . magnificent view , so-so overpriced food . we wound up spending $ 90 per person . i was afraid they would add $ 20 to the bill . i do not understand what this place is so popular .
american	our party of six ordered and waited--and waited--and waited--while others , including a table of eight , were seated , ordered and served . my husband got up , found our server , and asked about our food . she brought it out soon after , but it was cold and not as ordered . the server was apologetic and offered to replace the food , but after waiting so long , we were unwilling to wait another hour . others in our party just ate cold food . all of us agreed that we wouldn 't recommend it or go back . lots of other local restaurants from which to choose !
american	it is impossible for the wait staff to see anybody , and the service has become lackluster . we met some friends for dessert after having dined elsewhere . i order the gigantic ( as advertised ) skor sundae , it is not gigantic , and you can do a lot better at dairy queen . since this is a neighborhood restaurant , we have eaten there often , but the last 3 times the service was poor and the food so so .
american	we arrived and asked for the fresh fish menu , to our surprise they did not have one as they were out of most of their fish . the blame for this lays solely on a poor manager not ordering correctly . we should have just gotten up and left , be we stayed due to time issues . i had the wood fire grilled salmon . it was over done , and the quality of the fish was impressive as the color was straight from a salmofan and there was very little salmon flavor , defiantly not a wild sakeye .
american	i find owners and management of restaurants that originate in nyc tend to run their restaurants the same way here in vegas and in general the wrong way here on the west coast . management is rude and thus rubs off on their employees . service is slow and we found ourselves asking for everything water , drinks , desert menu etc .... small portions and ridiculously high prices . food was luke warm and unseasoned. chocolate cake for desert was good . this place has a long way to go . stay away and eat at one of the other 100 great restaurants vegas has to offer .
american	anyone who thinks king 's food ( other than ice cream ) is good , must hate food . the atmosphere is a typical cheap diner ( which isn 't a bad thing ) . i would describe the staff as hardworking and stressed out but generally some nice people .
american	we went to this buffet with an expectation of excellence , but only to encounter a rude greeter , a forgetful waitress , salty food , limited choice , and an environment equivalent to a $ 20 buffet . for $ 42 / person for lunch , we expected a lot more , especially when wynn is charging under $ 30 . we are every disappointed and will not visit again .
american	an expensive denny 's. pass this one by. just not up to good egg standards .
american	crowded when i was there , had to sit at the bar . service wasn 't good ( had to ask for silver and napkin ) , food wasn 't good , way overpriced ( ok , it 's vegas , but $ 15 for a mediocre hamburger ? ) why eat there ?
american	the large open concept bench design was a cute touch . however , food and service fell flat for me . i got the salmon benny - and while it wasn 't terrible , the amount of smoked salmon was pretty sad , and the " side of fruit " was literally just a slice of orange . all for a grand total of $ 16 . not to mention the 35 minute wait time for our food and another 5 minutes to wait for our change . while our waiter was apologetic , i can 't say i would ever want to come back again , considering better and faster brunch places in the city .
american	the place seemed to have enough employees , but it seemed poorly managed . the one positive is the decor has a clean , modern design . the decor , however , does make up for the poor service and overpriced food ( $ 5.50 for one , thin waffle ) . we asked a guy , who i assume is a manager , to warm up a plate of biscuits and gravy . he never came back . i felt bad for the sever who was overwhelmed with her tables . i really wish this place was better .
american	was wrong to believe them . it was normal breakfast food that just tasted fresher than what you could eat at denny 's . not sure why people are obsessed with it . i guess for that long of a wait you expect very yummy food and it was a let down .
american	an hour and a half wait ... really ? kinda an epic fail and not coming back even when that was my first attempt to try the establishment .
american	i don 't think so . not happening in this lifetime .
american	waitress hasn 't checked on us in half an hour . would rate the food , but have no clue because we are still waiting . ridiculous .
american	they 're obviously understaffed . but apparently steak and eggs are good . i don 't know , i had the dry chicken and portobello mushrooms .
american	we finished eating in 10 minutes . now we 're uncomfortably full , like a belly full of lead . i had potato pancakes , pierogis and carrot cake . just meh . i don 't see what all the fuss is about .
american	upon discussing this with who i believed to be a manager she commented on the wait to which he proceeded to debate instead of addressing the hygiene issue regarding the hair . will never return . will share this experience with any one that brings this place up .
american	just because you 're running a dive doesn 't mean you have to serve crappy food . m & tg & s should think a little harder amount the concept of " salad . " additionally , the pork souvlaki was super full of gristle . the floors and covered with food and the place ( bathrooms included ) is generally filthy .
american	stuff isn 't freshly made- prepared in advance . ok for bacon and potatoes but eggs were dry .
american	i had the trout sandwich which has way too much bread and lettuce with very little fish . the flavours were all covered by the lettuce and bread . the halibut fish and chip was not good either . they should 've given a smaller piece of fish that was thicker . they give you once piece of fish that is long and thin which tasted very dry . i 'm used to getting two pieces of fish when i get fish and chips . very cheap on the fish considering the price you pay . would not recommend .
american	dry aged steak ? they just aren 't supposed to be chewy . the side dishes were mediocre . the bread on the other hand was nice because of the large selection they offer . the raisin wheat bread was the best . it didn 't help that it was late and we were very hungry . again , steak is not supposed to be chewy . one would expect much more for the price .
american	absolutely disgusting . filthy everywhere . the " server " was busy watching tv and was put out to help us . my food was abysmal and over cooked had to send it back . never again .
american	white people food is what i call it . i thought the lighting was off , way too dark , and the atmosphere is very loungy , take that as you will . not worth it .
american	animals are always welcome at this retailer however not so much for handicapped people pallets all over the place what a joke way to go kroger
american	animal style .. most overrated burger joint ever .. don 't believe the hype .. it 's cheap tho !
american	the burgers and fries were good - literally everything else was terrible , particularly the service . from waiting an incredibly long time for drinks , to having to go to the restroom to get paper towels to use instead of the napkins that we couldn 't get to save our own lives , to the non-existent refills even after asking , to the tables and chairs that make it next to impossible to walk through the restaurant , everything was miserable . there is zero chance i would set foot in here again and would have to question anything from this chain based on this particular restaurant .
american	they reheat previously made slices and it tastes like cafeteria food . the crust is very thick , the sauce is unpleasant , overall just really bad . avoid at all costs if you have decent standards for your pizza .
american	an interesting place to check out but the food is consistently disappointing , especially considering how pricey the menu is .
american	hottest day in charlotte and not much cooler inside . sweated through appetizers , salads and entrée .
american	used to be great but has gotten worse with each visit . bad management i think . ahh , confirmed that . just now , my wife 's wine glass had lipstick on it . not her 's , new glass . management was huffy . not anymore . trying epicenter dinner theater .
american	the food quality resembles third grade cafeteria more than vegas . we ate here twice . on the plus side , kids liked the simple pizza , pasta and make-your-own sandwich areas . also the assortment of salads was reasonable , if you don 't expect too many vegetables . however the sushi was dry and its rice still crunchy . the sausage was cold and spanish rice not fully cooked . two of my favorite dishes , bok choy and eggplant parmesan were overcooked beyond recognition . i wanted to give it one star but the service was good and kids liked some of the food .
american	the decor , however , is annoying and not at all conducive to relaxing and enjoying the meal . much too much fake nostalgia .
american	it 's a shell of the actual fast-food restaurants , but it fills the hole for a quick bite and drink while traversing the rio . service was adequate , although i attacked the restaurant when there were no customers . so maybe adequate is not good enough when i 'm the only customer . the whopper was bland . the ingredients were fresh enough , and i saw the server make my hamburger so i know it wasn 't premade . but it just tasted bland . overall , it 's just meh .
american	the food tastes pretty good . but not spectacular . ( the sweet potato pecan pie is good ; unique ) overpriced ! ! ! cashier was not friendly at all .
american	i was charged $ 19 . the service was slow and it felt like we interupted a staff meeting of better business practice . nonfriendly , not interested in serving . not going there ever again
american	for example , when one of our party of 12 asked for her steak well done the waitress ' response was that it would take 17-20 minutes and delay the other dinners , so she should order something else ! ( apparently it didn 't occur to her to just put that order in first ! ) fried fish sliders came on a plate with ... two fried fish sliders , not even a slice of pickle as a garnish ! definitely not destination dining .
american	hey wendy 's , when you put a tomato on a burger that 's no bigger than a silver dollar and doesn 't even cover half the burger put another tomato on it ! if you care anything about serving a quality product then use a little common sense ! this always seems to happen when i get my order to go because they know people won 't bother driving back to complain !
american	i went to sonic to get their two for one app special dark chocolate concrete . the girl said they had no custard today . are you kidding me . everytime i go there i continue to have a bad experience . i wish they would go out of business so something better can take their place . this place has been consistently bad since it opened several years ago . you would think it would have improved by now but apparently management could care less or just doesn 't know how to run a service business .
american	i believe her name is ryan . very bad customer service . worse thing ever to have bad attitude as your 1st impression . high tide please re-train or re-think your hiring especially your people facing employees . bad posture , slouching , no smile , rudeness . it was so bad we left ....
american	waiter never asked my husband what he wanted . i asked for a desert menu . thirty minutes later he brought it . terrible customer service on a regular basis . never ordered anything , we didn 't want to wait an hour for our dinner .
american	you think for a nice resort they have good food . service was good .. pass on this one ...
american	one star for our server as she was nice and friendly but our food was not the best . the location is quite big and their are plenty of seats . but wow the food did not have taste as we struggle to finish breakfast the easy meal on the planet to eat . the eggs we not done the best and the potatoes were a disgrace . the best thing about the meal was toast with butter ! i will have to try another sunset grill location so see if this was a franchise issue or a hit and miss .
american	would you like creamed spinach , steamed broccoli , or mashed potatoes served family style with your hunk of beef ? ugh ! ! the only thing that redeemed the meal is that someone else picked up the check !
american	poor service and bad food . while there was more staff than customers , the waiter was a ghost . raw oysters were good - the rest ( steak frozen , risotto balls frozen , pulled pork bland ) was way below average . this place has been on the line of below average and a no go for a while . it is now officially a no go - so bummed ...
american	the beers and beer selection are great . the menu is actually good , but the food verrrrry salty . usually so crowded , you may have to go down the street to one of the other many chains .
american	this chain seems prettier on the inside , but my chicken and cheddar sandwich was rather uninteresting and mundane . the prices are pretty good as this small went for $ 5.85 . just some pre packaged chicken pieces and cheese toasted . everything else is extra like bacon and avocado . wasn 't in the upcharge mode . chain , chain go away .
american	the food hasn 't seemed to change since i 've gone here except for less options . waiting for a table is common unless you go at really off peak times . recently got a burger there . asked for well done , and burger arrived bloody and red . waiter took it back and about 5 minutes brought the same burger back and was still pink on the inside . was offered something else , but the others i was with were already done . did get a coupon for a return visit . good deal with the 2 for $ 20 and an app if your food is cooked right .
american	great chicken salad but with stems still in the strawberries . service is hit and miss here . the music turns 80 's too early and the clientele is a bit trashy - hello church street . get it together people . more effort required .
american	however , the latter is good and hb is bad . the sandwiches are small , overpriced , and dry . the salad bar , while boasting an impressive 55 items is : 1. not self-service , 2. not particularly inspired , and 3. tastes like the stuff you 'd get at a regular , crappy eat n ' park salad bar . the only real pro is the boylan 's soda fountain but it hardly justifies regular patronage .
american	deep fried mac & beer cheese - $ 12 crispy on the outside , cold on the inside. seriously ? the chefs at the henry need to take some lessons from the folks at tasty bunz ! they either don 't know what good truffle tots and deep fried mac n cheese are or they simply don 't care. yes , i do believe there is an art to good fried food. i 'm more than willing to pay an arm and a leg for comfort food ... so long as it 's good. unfortunately , the henry is overpriced and underwhelming .
american	paid $ 6 for a slice of red velvet cake and received a tiny piece , was barely an inch wide at the widest spot . paid $ 5.49 for an order of breaded zucchini and got maybe 8 thin strips , much less than most places i 've gotten it from . a big ripoff and does nothing to differentiate itself from the 80 % of pittsburgh pizza shops that are on a similar level .
american	food was average , think applebee 's . except 3x the price . i expect something a cut above at a premium priced las vegas strip restaurant . don 't eat here .
american	we got other people 's food ( a fish sandwich ) , my burger was cold and the wings melted the styrofoam in the container that they were put in . i complained about a horrible female server before and have given them another chance .... never again .
american	i would never eat inside here because of the uncomfortable seating and the blaring lebanese ( i assume ) music . it 's bad enough sitting there for a half hour with no other customers while the staff prepares your food with absolutely no sense of urgency . when i got home the meals were neither warm nor fresh . my wife wouldn 't touch her gyro platter , my small la kabob platter was completely bland and uninteresting . while the prices are moderate the portions are small .
american	my husband and i come to have breakfast and was waiting for our food for more than 40 min and everyone that come after us got their food . finally my husband spoke with the manager that let him know that our waitress forgot to place our order . the manager was nice gave us the food for free for the wait .
american	saw this advertised the 7.77 meal deal . i 'm with a group of 7 - let 's try it ! well unless you have a " membership " it 's really 9.99 - ok never the less ordered the steak , green beans and mashed potatoes special ... steak was tough as a board and we asked for it medium / rare - nope it was horrible ! sorry , don 't do it ! gonna keep looking for a good special !
american	their chocolate fondue was a massive let down . while the service was ok , there 's nothing that would bring me back to this place . and * what * is up with the stacks of glass plates ? they look like giant upside down plastic cups . pass ! ! !
american	other reviewers have used " mediocre " but that 's being kind . the food is sub-par for a traditional restaurant . i 've had better at local bars that a " cook " working with only a microwave and deep fryer . it all tastes pre-packaged and processed . i guess the pitt students like it for the price and convenient location .
american	what a shame . better off at mc donalds opposite i hate to say ..
american	burnt the crap out of my hoagie and whoever was in charge still let that food go out for delivery . pizza undercooked , hoagie burnt .
american	i stopped by for lunch with a friend , and we found seats at the bar . the bartender barely even tried to fake friendliness , and proceeded to mess up an order that consisted of 2 salads . luckily , the server who actually brought food to us was accommodating and fixed the order . the salad was on par with what you would get at a chili 's , but cost twice as much . nothing special to see here , folks .
american	the snobby hostess with the " come as you are " shirt is not an asset to this establishment . maybe if you put a smile on your face and lost the entitled teeny bopper attitude you would be happy ! ! as far as the food . nothing like the original . burger was bland . won 't be returning to this location . message to management : hire people that want to be there and give quality service and serve quality food .
american	5 star pricing with 2 star food and 2 star staff ! i left starving and disappointed ! out of almost every wine i asked for on their menu , app 's were sub power and the chicken lettuce wrap tasted like rubber soaked soy sauce . huge disappointment ! staff looked disheveled and unkept . i felt like i was at vinnie 's all over again but with 131 main pricing . : (
american	first of all the design of the restaurant is convoluted . it is a mix of formal and industrial elements that just give you an uneasy feeling . the turkey french dip was not worth the price . the french fries were limp and mushy . the prime steak sandwich was a bunch of beef strips on a bun . the meat was tender but lots of sinew and grisle . not a good value . try wallys across the street . way better and not a corporate restaurant .
american	the burgers are decent , nothing too excellent or unique about them . i think they 're pretty greasy because i was nauseous after half a burger . i tried the zinburger and diablo . the truffle fries are ok but limp . the aoli that comes with it isn 't very well matched to it . the sweet potato fries were ok but also a bit undercooked . not a fan , no need to go back .
american	bland , tasteless , burgers and soggy fries . places like this need to stop opening .
american	it has since been changed and butchered ! just another reason to avoid the junk !
american	another installment in chef laurent tourondel 's line of restaurants ( the " lt " in blt ) , blt steak in los angeles being the other spot of his i 've tried . it 's location in the mirage is solid and the decor was very cool . i had the toasted marshmallow milkshake and i loved it . i could care less about the burger and those who stepped it up and ordered the american kobe burger , were not impressed either . save the calories and money and pass on the burger and fries . blt burger is more like blt milkshake in my opinion .
american	another greasy spoon , been in business for god knows how many years. their breakfast is okay , bur most of their other food are horrible , except corn beef or roast beef sandwich its was really good tips order hot ( warm ) roast beef sandwich
american	not a patch on otto lenghi 's mediterranean cuisine . sexy but lacks the real mediterranean substance . good for a visit . forget the mediterranean taste , just feast your eyes with the scenery and you are done . suresh chawla toronto
american	will not be returning . why do you think it 's ok to short your customers on the soup that 's really not that good . each container was an inch and a half below the top of the container and enough salt to choke on . the soup i had was the yucatan chicken tortilla . i must say it was terrible tasting . my wife liked her salad . i think it 's because she got a chocolate covered strawberry ? ? ? ?
american	overall i was dissapointed and won 't be going back . their real coffee is weakish and slightly acidic . their decaf coffee was better but also weak . eggs are pale and bland . hash browns have nice appearance but are also bland . on the bright side , biscuits and gravy are good , with buiscuits being fluffy ( a rarity ) . service is excellent and the atomosphere of the place is nice and bright .
american	we had a couple of appetizers and did not even get to the entrée because we were so disgusted with how awful the appetizers were . it was a friday night at 8 pm , the place was empty which should 've been my first clue . we sat in the bar where there was live music . with all the great talent in phoenix , they had to choose a duo that used a synthesizer and played very outdated music . not a good experience . we will definitely not be back .
american	shrimp parmesan north carolina style apparently means a small shrimp buried inside a hush puppy . it 's no wonder this is a chain restaurant haven , the local offerings provide no alternative .
american	the beer tasted like ... generic beer . nothing to write home about . i had the amber ale . meh . for dinner , i ordered the burger . the only thing that was enjoyable about it would be the ciabatta bread that it came on . it 's always worrisome when the server doesn 't ask you how you would like the burger prepared , and , as a result , the burger was overdone . not helping was the fact that it tasted like a pre-formed thawed beef patty out of a box . womp womp . the portions are also small for the price you are paying .
american	4 $ for a large oj . food took forever and came out after everyone who came after us . benedict poached egg was broken , sausage overcooked . funny taste from whatever they use for frying . not again biscuits .
american	they have pizza and pizza related items as well as breakfast . the breakfast was not good ( eggs , sausage , potatoes ) . i still have no clue how one can mess breakfast up . pizza was whatever , not worth they money they charge . this place is one of the only late night food options in the hotel , so many people like me don 't have a choice when trying to grab a bite at 4am after a night out .
american	carbon copy of wimpey 's decour yet sub par cuisine . asked about the eggs benny sauce which is always crucial to its success . was told it wasn 't made on premises but was good none the less . to my suspicion it was horrible . the taste was awful and had this cheap glaze look to the hollandais sauce . ended up getting a bacon cheese tomato omelette instead which was decent . my gf ate her eggs benny but later complained to me that her stomach was woozy . needless to say not going back . for those seeking a solid breakfast joint in 905 try boom it 's delish
american	very over priced food that 's not good at all . that advertise corn hole tournaments on sunday but don 't plan on playing anyone . the vibe is also terrible . won 't be coming here again .
american	on the first enjoyable patio day , we were pleased to get outside seating after a previous bad experience only moments before , while waiting for someone to at least give us some water , my hubby shored up the rickety table , and we waited some more . then some more . no water , no apps , no drink order taken . and somehow , others seated after us got served with all these things . not patronizing a restaurant on the decline , especially with a new place popping up in this area all the time .
american	my biscuits and gravy was so bland it was pathetic . the gravy tasted like paste and flour with no seasoning whatsoever . big portions of shitty food is still shitty food . trust me folks , this ain 't the food that you see on the food network shows anymore ! it 's gone way downhill in the past 3 years ! this was my last trip to hhagg .
american	nice clean space but not going back for the food . ordered a chicago dog with french fries . husband had italian beef sand . hotdog was boiled and not hot with a dill pickle sliced on it with relish , mustard and relish . boring ! fries were good though . the cost for 2 dogs and fries was $ 7 and sand was alright but wouldnt go back . goto luke 's instead
american	the only consolation here was that their waffles were above average . food was pretty pricy for 1 measly waffle , and portions were barely filling . additionally , the staff were grumpy , food was slow and their piss poor ventilation will leave you smelling like the place . ( a grease oven ) they seriously need to work on their ventilation , because i doubt anyone likes smelling greasy after a meal .
american	an after dinner cordial at the bar will cost you $ 10 . this place needs to reduce the size of their dinnerware - not their portions .
american	only reason we went there cause it was getting late ordered super burger combo and grilled chicken with baked potato . 45 minutes till it arrived at table . waitress couldn 't care less . so i didn 't feel bad about no tip . why can this eat n park have service in the morning but not in the evening .
american	it 's been around since the advent of fast food . they have a special sauce which they apply on super thin patties and hotdogs . i 've been to three of their locations in the past 25 years and despite the excellent , curtious , and clean service which is consistent through out all of their locations , their product is expensive and unappetizing . the fries are terrible thin and boring and overall it 's simply not worth it . every time i 've been there i 've had 5 cheese burgers with a fry finding myself eating again two hours later . go once so you can say you 've been there otherwise don 't bother .
american	another over rated and over priced burger place , dry wagyu burger ... what a shame , ordered it medium rare and was over cooked to medium well ..
american	the place looks awesome , but what they offered for $ 53 per person is the epitome of tourist trap . cooked oysters and clams had lots of sand in it , i had to spit it out . crab legs were partially frozen . beef ribs were dry . prime rib was overcooked ( and i got the center cut ) , raw oysters looked gross . now , this one takes the cake . they have " tomahawk ribeye " but it 's not a real tomahawk cut . i don 't have problems with how it 's cut , but using fancy names to fool your customers is kind of embarrassing for a place like wynn .
american	sub par grilled cheese big effing deal . i don 't get the fools who are constantly raving about this place like its the greatest thing since sliced bread . i could make a better grilled cheese at home any day and not have to wait 3 freakin hours to get it . the only good thing about this place is the decor and the fact that i met the love of my life there .
american	type of place you love or it is just ok . had a group in for the holiday 's and though this would be good place to go . i know obama likes the pancakes which are thinner and like crepes , so i tried them . not my cup of tea . but my cup of tea was good . also , tried a vegetable omelet , and veggies were still cool . the lyonnaise potatoes are good . place was crowded and had a line waiting for tables , then service was slow and had trouble getting the check . decor is art deco 1960 combination .
american	the short ribs ravioli were ok nothing special , the wife had the baked prawns and we split the margherita flat bread ... more like tortilla than flat bread , she was not impressed , i give it two stars because service was decent and people were friendly or else it would of been 1 star .
american	this place is not very good ! it 's a very below average diner with really crappy cookies .
american	there is a very small selection , the soups were terrible and for the price , i would rather just go to the feast buffet at sunset station for less ! ! !
american	service was ok , nothing special . the food was meh , really lacked in flavor . the most annoying part of our meal here was the flies . they had the patio door open and we were seated by the front door . the entire meal was spent swatting flies . we think there are much better greek places with much better service and food then pita jungle .
american	hotel food . i know they don 't need to offer quality as they have a built in clientele but it would be nice if they tried to anway .
american	i have been going there since they opened and have had their b & e chicken maybe 40 times . tonight 's was bad . it was a hummingbird size portion and cooked within an inch of its poor life , dry as a bone . it used to be the go to entree , alas no more . kfc next time i want chicken for dinner .
american	it was crowded and the service wasn 't that great . my grape leaves tasted like rubber and had tomatoes in them even though i asked for none . the hummus tasted like it was made from powder and the pitas were hard .
american	sat at the bar , ordered eggs , pancakes and sausage . took 40 minutes to come out and was cold . waitress did not understand telling her customers about the specials , or offering refills on coffee . sausage patties had clumps of congealed fat on top . eggs were very good . why are the young people working in restaurants so god damn lazy ? it 's a hard job , and you deserve a good tip if and i do mean if you actually do your job .
american	the food is downright bad . my husband loves steak and gets sick if this restaurant is mentioned . the sweet potatoe must have been cooked and then frozen and then thawed ... it was so runny and icky . how do you mess up a sweet potatoe ?
american	this one is a slight step above dennys . and i 'm not sure if this is the one on recker and mckellips or power and main . the latter is even worse ...
american	you have to work at it , really hard , to make eggs benedict unpalatable . you have to expend concerted effort to make scrambled eggs so dry and unappealing that even my kid , the scourge of all eggs , won 't eat them . i don 't even remember what my wife ordered , but she gave up after two bites , because it was revolting .
american	they dont understand direction very well ( at all for that matter ) ! greasy fries , mayo ( when you ask for no mayo , ask for 3 diet sodas & what do you get ? ? root beer ! even after they verify that " you wanted diet , right ? " they don 't even have diet root beer ! constant customers no more ! !
american	as much as they charge for a bacon , egg & cheese biscuit and 1 lityle 2-inch piece of bacon . really ? this place sucks and i should have stsyed away . make sure to count your change too !
american	most of the servers and staff act as if they are doing you a favor . ugh . also , their smokehouse is too small and they are almost always out of at least 2 items by 6pm every night . i have only tried the original location and my review is of the original . i have been coming here since the beginning and it has gotten worse not better with time . it would also be great if they took reservations . perhaps they could better plan ahead to accommodate the crowd . i enjoy the food but not the dining experience . i will likely continue to enjoy via takeout .
american	one thing that this buffet does really good is their salad bar . i started there and i was extremely impressed by how fresh the ingredients were and how great the dressing tasted . plus , the little cheese display right next to the salads provided some delicious eats as well . everything else about the buffet was super disappointing though , aside from the service , which was actually pretty good . the food was not tasty and totally not worth as much as they were charging .
american	so if you don 't enjoy listening to sports then its a good spot .
american	closest bar to my house . hadn 't been there on 3 months after previous bad experience . lived up to its reputation , 3 / 6 / 15 .
american	after 3 months i decided to gave this place another chance , big mistake ! ! ! i order steak and eggs , everything in my order and service was ok but the hash browns was horrible ! ! ! ! ! ! ! omg the potato was raw and green ! ! i ask my server and she replied , is the light , well dear im not blind , green is green to me ! ! ! potato was very old no escuse ! ! never again .
american	ordered med-rare . came out well-done . 3rd time in a row this has happened to me . not sure why i keep going back ... oh yeah ! that $ 9 steak and fries is a great lunch deal ! next time will try ordering rare and hope i get medium !
american	yes- the food and concept is good . however the service as in the hostess department is abysmal . it 's like they send all these early 20 year olds to a school where they learn that they 're time is more important than yours . every single fox concept i 've gone to is like this- it 's pathetic
american	over priced , subpar food that costs twice what it should , because it is in a sold in a hip , trendy restaurant . the pizza sauce has the flavor of generic ketchup and the chicken was dry and lacked any flavor whatsoever . if this sounds good to you , then you will love it .
american	have given them numerous tries and have never been more than meh at best . service leaves a lot to be desired as well . if i want a good cheap burger , our best option is foster 's at concord mills unfortunately . i really wish hwy 55 were better .
american	feta fries were pretty bad , there was a glob of some white melted cheese over them all , and their feta seemed a little rubbery . the lamb / beef gyro was average , overall i 'd say 3 stars if prices were decent , but we just dropped a little over $ 40 on what we thought was going to be a cheap delivery dinner night , shit , all i wanted was papa johns 2 large for $ 16 !
american	the price point is too high for what you get . we won 't be back . the flatbread pizza and omelette were just simply not good . the server never even stopped to ask how the food was . the men 's bathroom had a bad sewer gas odor . trust the reviews you see for this chain restaurant !
american	if like salt and i mean over salted than come here . the manager was nice enough to give one of my guests desert which was huge but we will never go again .
american	i figured this was a high end resort nope . steak tasted like dirty grill order a glass of silver oak that tasted old . service just was not there ... pass on this one ...
american	oh and thanks for the mall employee discount ( that doesn 't exist ) !
american	sat down ordered drinks , then apps , the food shows up and no drinks , no waitress , the food is gone now and no drinks , no waitress . finally she shows up and i say " don 't you think it 's ridiculous that we 've finished our food and still don 't have our our drinks ? " she then started to make an excuse , i stopped her and said " i just want the drink i ordered 25 minutes ago " other places will get my money
american	a free rooty tooty ( pancakes ) . my wife took the pancakes . she said they were fine , though she thinks they were smaller now than last year . i had the tuscan scramble . never again . i tasted no seasoning and no parmesan , even though the menu description says i should have . it was just eggs with a bit of spinach and pepper . probably too much compared to the quantity of egg . give this one a pass . in fact , without a coupon don 't even bother pulling into the parking lot . you can do a lot better .
american	2 orders of soggy all you can eat fries , 2 single cheese burgers , 1 -1.82 water , and 1 coke . $ 24.00 . cash only ! lobbys has a much better burger . i wish we would have went out for anything else !
american	our table of 6 was sat at a disfigured high-top table that should have comfortably fit 4 . the bar stools in a restaurant were unacceptable . my 5-beer flight was probably only about 4 full . each glass had about 1 / 4 of the beer spilled out of it onto the wooden disgusting flight-sever . my food came out 5 minutes before anyone else . one entree came out 15 minutes after everything else . the chicken and waffle sushi was cold . we sent it back . it came out cold again . then they tried to charge us for it ! would never go back .
american	my wife 's salad had a big hair in it . 2 . the pork in my pita was processed meat and tasted disgusting . 3 . my food took over 20 mins to prepare , even though they had about 6-7 staff in the kitchen ( although they were mostly socializing ) . 4 . the food tasted bad , not surprising , since they likely use low quality ingredients . my advice , stay away from this dump , unless you like crappy food .
american	crab legs were frozen and saulty . terrible prime ribs . stale salads . waiters will not refill your drinks unless you ask . chefs had bad attitudes when preparing / assisting . desserts were average . go to a nice steak house instead .
american	sandwiches for $ 12 . quality keeps going down hill and portions smaller and less side dish options . just okay food at top dollar because it 's in scottsdale . won 't be ordering from this establishment ever again . ordered for pick up and realized when i got back to the office that the chips we ordered with our sandwiches weren 't in with the order . i called to complain and explained that driving back wasn 't an option . didn 't seem like the employees cared at all that items were forgotten in the order and the best they could do was offer a $ 3 gift card . what a joke !
american	who runs out of chicken ? seriously ? ? ? ? ? ordered the noodle bowl since they ran out of chicken and that thing was a complete fail . it had no flavor unless you count old pork / pork belly smell and taste as flavor . i do not ! it was supposed to come with a soft-poached egg in it- no egg to be found . it really wouldn 't have made the dish palatable regardless ! should have just eaten at tipsy cow for lunch instead of only stopping for a drink while waiting for graze to seat us . and get some moscow mule mugs for pete 's sake !
american	feels like we are at a church pot luck next to a giant barn ! ! !
american	$ 9.74 for a bud light ? no thank you . # trash
american	my wife ordered the pasta di mare as she was craving scallops . the 2 scallops with the meal were tiny and looked chewed on . when we made mention of the poorly plated food ( after spending 3 minutes trying to get any employee 's attention ) , the poorly trained female manager came over on the defensive and attempted to win an argument i suppose . they offered to bring a few extra scallops , and the offended chef was kind enough to bring us unflavored , cold , and mushy replacements . between this experience and the complimentary , persistently annoying disney singing performances , i doubt we will be back .
american	no really ! i asked at the front desk what their best asset is and they told me the hooters restaurant . we stopped in for some wings and onion rings . the service was really poor even though there were six seated ( i had to add the word seated because an employee said i was lying by saying 6 tables ) tables in the entire restaurant . i swear the sauces were canned from sysco and the onion rings are frozen . i am truly amazed that an establishment like this can stay in business ! follow up ... i was contacted by the hotel informing me it was recently sold and scheduled for renovation .
american	the burgers are fantastic . antonio 's behavior is appalling ! he is foul mouthed , rude and instigates customers . johnson and whales really failed with this guy . help put this guy out of business . if you see a health violation like antonio smoking then handling food without gloves , go online to the health deparent and file a complaint . after the way he treated me in his restaurant i will make it a point to help prevent others from being exposed to this place and health hazards . let 's put antonio at chubz out of business !
american	i came here with high expectations based on recommendations from friends and reviews i 'd read . my wife ordered the priest burger , i ordered the high priest and a side of chili cheese fries . each burger cost about $ 10 . although my wife enjoyed hers i didn 't think mine lived up to the hype . the patties were okay but nothing to write home about . it also didn 't help that my burger was lukewarm . chili cheese fries were also mediocre . too much cheese and super soggy fries . my advice is that you find another burger temple to worship at .
american	the other chick filas seem to have happier and just nicer employees . they weren 't mean abut they were typical . but we asked about the military discount or law enforcement discount again and the manager replied that unfortunately we do not do this . when i asked about how they are the only chick fila that doesn 't , his reply was " unfortunately , the owner just doesn 't want to consider it . we know that others have talked about it and mentioned it , but its up to him and he just doesn 't want to offer it . "
american	after all this happened , the event organizers complained to the corporate office . apparently , the follow up to this was that the manager who was leading the charge on doing this was fired . good riddance .
american	the food is okay . there is nothing special about their shakes and is , in my opinion , overpriced . as i mentioned , this is like in-n-out but with a nicer ambiance .
american	valet only parking no valet parkers no choice of seating in a near empty restaurant darkened room midday had to request wine list one order of a walleye plate morphed into the delivery of a fish sandwich which wasn 't even on the menu the salt shaker top was loose so it all poured on my meal french fries cold and soggy never offered desert took 4 people to validate parking the place is a mess
american	the selection is not very good , the food is sub par , service not las vegas quality for the prices charged . the atmosphere is like a high school cafeteria . even the desserts were disappointing . if your going to splurge on a buffet on a buffet go to wynn or bellagio .
american	i was there today for breakfast and it was a disappointment . i have had better food at denny 's . despite not being busy and having at least a half dozen employees standing around doing nothing but talking to each other , it took quite a while to even get my order taken . my server was very nice , but the food was mediocre at best . the hash browns had a little crisp on top , but the vast majority were soggy , pale white crap . the omlet had about an inch of swiss cheese on top , even though i ordered cheddar . i will never go back .
american	i hope they didn 't give me that persons contaminated burger .
american	anyone notice , the prices vary depending on the person at cash , the same sandwich combo can vary from $ 11 to $ 14 ..... that 's something management should look into ...
american	this is the most over rated restaurant in pickering . borderline tolerable food , terrible service , outdated decor . 1 visit in 25 years is plenty .
american	i feel like i paid $ 10 for a big mac . small , overcooked and dried out patty , cooked to a greasy and oily mess on a flat top . asked to have my burger cut in half so could share with someone in my party and was refused , as ' it 's against their policy , and it changes the signature look of their burger ' . really ? it 's an underseasoned , overcooked , flavourless burger . there are far better places to eat in port credit .
american	i don 't know what kind of meat that was , but it wasn 't gyro meat . and when someone asks for fries to be boxed separately , don 't just put them in the styro containers smaller compartment , box them separately ! the place was virtually empty when i walked in long after anything resembling a lunch rush could have possibly happened , and tables were still dirty .. the cashier or manager or whatever was friendly but that does not make me ever want to go back in there ..
american	the wait in line is long , long , long . by the time we were seated many of the offerings were either empty or dried up . the dessert selection was extremely limited as i guess they ran out of options . the biggest disappointment was the lack of quality of food . we were looking forward to a nice dinner but left hungry--almost impossible to do at a buffet .
american	the burger i got tasted exactly like the one i had at smash burger . the service here was absolutely awful . waiting long periods for water and clean utensils . i asked the bartender what the round fried thing on my plate was and he explained to me it was the quad cut fry . it tasted more like a french fry cooked months ago that was sitting under the fryer that they decided to serve . don 't believe the hype !
american	worst food ever ! ! ! ! we took one bite ( cheese steak and hamburger- they gave use the wrong burger on top of that ! ! ) horrible , and through it out ! ! ! nasty taste , cheap hamburgers , no meat on cheese steak and had a horrible taste-
american	the carving station . beef is poor quality and the other food items are about the same home town buffet .
american	this place is just awful all around and the old lady at the counter needs to change her cranky pants . too bad this place is taking up space in a great neighborhood when a better restaurant could be occupying that space . oh well it 's a matter of time so we 'll just be patient until a real burger joint shows up .
american	the gyro reminded me of something one might get at a gas station , you know , next to the 3 day old hot dogs and pump cheese . this is not gyro meat , it is some kind of " gyro " looking meat but is most certainly not the real deal . charging what you do for the " cheap " food you provide is reason enough for me not to come back or recommend to anyone . very disappointing .
american	they 're one of the few places in charlotte that ship their bread in from amoroso 's - the same place geno 's and pat 's get it from in philly . and somehow their cheesesteaks still suck . it 's the meat . it 's not good . i 've had several other menu items here because i like the beer selection - nothing is better than average .
american	bad service and bad food 4 times in a row . i 'm close to this one so i keep giving them a chance but after today i 'm done . they are so bad at something so easy , beer and wings . half moon bay or zipps are much better .
american	as someone who makes pierogies from scratch paying homage to my heritage , to say i was disappointed is an understatement . i understand taking some short cuts here and there but i have a hard time believing in a city known for pierogies that some better local options aren 't available . other than that , the service was fine , we had a larger group and our waiter kept up pretty well and was very friendly . drinks and the rest of our food was okay but nothing to write home about . if you want standard bar food and aren 't fussy about sourcing or who makes it then here 's your spot .
american	tasted great but got food poisoning ! ! we didn 't drink at all tonight , and i have literally been up all night because my upset stomach . our ( bf 's and mine ) first night of vegas ( we 're only here for two ! ! ) was ruined because of the tuna melt sandwich we shared . proceed with caution . i know this place has rave reviews , but is it really worth the risk ? we missed out on an entire friday night of partying thanks to this place and will most likely not be at 100 % for tonight 's festivities . my verdict : not worth the risk .
american	i asked our server about what i perceived as a type-o . she grinned her best 3 tooth grin and kindly answered " it 's cause we don 't like those french for not supporting us in iraq . " uh . ok . if you want a good meal , and not feel like your iq dropped 15 points for reading the menu , i suggest not going to scott 's generations .
american	however it did not live up to the hype . we decided to get a lobster roll - big mistake . the ' lobster ' had the consistency of minced tuna with tiny chunks of lobster through it . it didn 't have that signature sweetness of lobster and wasn 't smooth and tender . the bun was very bleh , and doughy . it also came with a slaw , chips and a pickle . the sides were not noteworthy but the chips were decent . we can 't comment on any of the other dishes but definitely avoid the lobster roll .
american	the food had obviously been sitting out for the duration of the day , to the point the server had to stir it before serving me . what i thought was spaghetti sauce ended up being grease and tomato paste . i fought thru half of the generous bowl of noodles , and washed it back with the the best part of the meal , a cold gatorade . i 'd fly past this airport location , and try my luck at the nearest sandwich cooler next time .
american	it is always busy and loud and the servers tend to disappear . the servers don 't come and check on you , so if you want to order food , you better put your whole order in at the beginning , because the next time you see your server will be to pay your bill . food selection here is good , beer selection is okay . but if i 'm going to choose a place for a large group to go and have better service , i 'm going to go next door to pacific junction hotel . sorry , betty 's , you just don 't cut it .
american	they rope you in with specials and they are always done and the food doesn 't taste fresh . it tastes like it was made the same day justb12 hours ago . rather eat at shitty ass sunrise ( who also suck )
american	hey matt , maybe your restaurant would be doing better if you treated your customers with respect . by the way your pasta drowning in cheesy alfredo sauce shouldn 't be on the " lighter side " menu . it probably has 3000 calories . not recommended
american	the meal came out before the drinks . the burger was not as ordered and over cooked . the bacon with the burger was raw . water had to be requested 3 times . oh and there was an issue with the beer , don 't ask me what it was but the manager made excuses for it . on top of all that they only gave 20 % off after we requested restitution . on the up side the beer once delivered was good and the fries were excellent . on the down side the staff in both the front of the house and the back need to be trained properly .
american	i ordered up some chicken tenders and a side of mashed potatoes . some of the tenders looked like tenders and some of them where compressed in such a way that they resembled chicken flavored straws . the consistency of the mashed potatoes was satisfactory but the gravy was bland . oh ya .... the flour flake puck that comes with the meal is a joke .
american	big chunks of lobster but i just wish it was 1 ) a little big bigger 2 ) the bread was okay but not the best lobster mac and cheese was nothing special but it the lobster was good just mac and cheese probably could have used better cheese .
american	i 'm done with claim jumper . the penny pinching new owners don 't deserve my business and i don 't want their food .
american	must be a california thing . chili on everything , the consistency of baby food . had to search to find the burger patty . the chili cheese fries turned neon from the greese . burped all the way down the 95 to the airport .
american	( i like their sanwhiches / pasta , but pizza is average . ) not worth the wait .
american	if it 's the middle of the night and you 've been out drinking , it 's a pretty solid destination . if you are sober and looking for a nice burger , apache burger probably isn 't your best bet . they only take cash , but have an atm on location ( there is also a bmo around the corner ) . the last time i went to ab , one of my friends had food poisoning the next morning . i 've never had a burger that made me sick , but it 's generally not my kind of joint .
american	this review is specifically for the " resort . " fortunately , when you 're at the lake you don 't have to spend much time in the rooms so i will keep this short and sweet ... bring your own bedding and try not to touch anything . you have been warned .
american	probably the worst buffet i 've ever had . most of the food was over salted , over cooked , and chokingly dry . the service was hit or miss .. the cashiers were morose at best ; our server was very polite and efficient . i won 't ever eat here again , it was a waste of money and time .
american	i 've eaten café zupas six or seven times and every time the panini came out cold and awful .
american	drinks are overpriced , the food is really overpriced and it 's not even very good . your much better off at pickle barrel or even milestones for that matter .
american	however , a waitress came outside twice to assist the table next to us , but never even greeted us . can 't say we 'll ever come back .
american	when we asked the server what kinds of beer they served , she pointed to the menu and told us it was on there . lack of server training and messy halls with garbage bins and chairs make this place suitable for little more than a shot and a beer . gaggles of servers hung together chatting and chewing gum . beverages were overpriced at night .
american	the only good thing was the proximity to the water . food was over cooked and underwhelming yet expensive . service was meh . won 't return unless for drinks only .
american	basically we over paid for a bun with lettuce and unripened tomatoes , the soda was flat and tasted dirty . the french fries were way to greasy .... kinda like the cook . absolutely the worst food i have had in awhile . rather eat mcdonalds next time .
american	didn 't have much concern for me- so likely didn 't take much action behind the scene either . meat that raw is truly a danger . oh but took off that meal and 1 / 2 off the pizza and 1 root beer -i was so nauseated we needed to get up and leave-but had to wait for card to be returned . if i get sick there is proof in pics
american	" chicken was dry like it had been in the hot desert sun for a week . waffles were under cooked and doughy . it was called stuffing , but we couldn 't eat it , or tell what it really was . the wait staff were very friendly , but slow to come around . the " good " reviewers must not get out much . oh wait . . . over priced ! a lot of great restaurants close by , so pass this one on by .
american	a place of gluttony and waste especially if you get involved with the locals .
american	nearly the worst , slowest service i have ever received . seriously , a real bartender can make more than two mixed drinks at a time . a prime candidate for bar rescue .
american	food is overpriced for the quality . dryed out biscuits , boring house salad , served family style , overcooked , frozen corn on the cob . my prime rib was good , should have been 1 / 2 the price of what i paid ! beer list ? ha-ha . no . nice view of the city at night . that 's it . once was enough for me .
american	great burgers , happy hour specials and atmosphere but the service lacks ! the service is so bad , that alone will prevent me from coming back .
american	a spoon would have been nice , too . also ordered the chicken dinner but did not get t he gravy or any other sauces . total disappointment . not going back here .
american	30 min to get breakfast and not busy . eggs over cooked , potatoes undercooked , toast not toasted . pulled pork was dry and they topped off my " scrambler " with unmelted shredded cheese . not one good thing on the plate . at best a $ 5 breakfast . no garnish . boooooorrrring . its breakfast , not rocket science . service was friendly though . overall dissapointing .
american	the execution is institutional at best , the menu uninspired , and there are very few , if any , healthy options for dining . i had a chicken caesar salad today - the dressing was insipid , the chicken tough , dry and overcooked . the addition of a roasted pepper was decidedly odd and added nothing but did help the blandness of the plate . the menu advertised shaved parmesan - there was a little shaved parmesan in the otherwise tasteless dressing , but it was of very poor quality . my kids do enjoy it before the theater for the ( overpriced ) pizzas , but it is common food at best and not a dining experience .
american	i 'm so sad that this experience ruined my niece 's graduation dinner . will never return ! disgusted by our entire experience !
american	i had the steak bomb , the meat was very bland but the cheese flavor owned the entire sandwich ... no balance . my husband had the meatball sub , you 're better off buying the frozen meatballs from costco if you want a mediocre meatball sub . the fries are very cafeteria like .. not worth it and will not be back .
american	the fare is somewhat overpriced for minuscule drinks , meager portions and lackluster service . oddly , everyone seems to rave about their tater tots ...... yeah , the same processed frozen spud you enjoyed in elementary / parochial school .
american	ambiance within restaurant is nice , but surrounded by full-view , busy , garishly-lit shopping center parking lot . staff and management a little insensitive to the dining experience . they just don 't seem to be trying very hard for excellence . although we 've been in years past , this was our third attempt in recent months , being turned away at 9 : 30p on two separate weekend nights because of limited hours . too many better choices nearby to bother with dolce again . luisa is frankly better at the pizza business .
american	granted , we ate here purely to be able to dine " al fresco " ( or as much as it can be while in a casino ) , but the beer selection is abysmal and my meal wasn 't really even up to bar food standards . the tomato soup tastes like it came from a can and my spinach salad had unidentifiable ingredients . plus , it was all over priced . also , fyi to the waitresses , when a customer order san appetizer , it should come out before the rest of the meal .
american	the fries were underdone to the point where you can taste their unsanitary freezer . the cheese and gravy were fine .
american	not sure how you serve brown broccoli , old lettuce ... sad that corporate doesn 't care that a chain restaurant in an upscale neighborhood leaves such a bad taste for their brand .
american	we ordered the cookie from the dessert menu ( also $ 6 for a cookie is outrageous ) and it was so burned that you could smell from several feet away . we sent the cookie back but were still charged ! we asked to speak to the manager . rather than apologize and remove the fee , the manager proceeded to argue with us and refused to admit the cookie was burnt .
american	hostess and other employees were rude and completely ignored people waiting to be seated . once seated , prices weren 't provided and they weren 't willing to confirm , so we went to chili 's instead .
american	our party of 6 had a reservation weeks in advance and 30 minutes post reservation time we were still not seated . the three hostesses were completely incompetent and were just plain ignoring us . we were first told that our table was being set up and ten minutes later the same response . each of the three hostesses would go back to " check on the table " only to return a minute later and whisper to their co-hostess . after another 10 minutes a party that arrived after us with no reservation was seated ; at this point we had had enough and left . i would not return to this establishment , the service was absolutely disgusting .
american	because when we got here , they didn 't have my information . i got no apology from the front of house staff , and was asked what i wanted to do . then told its another 20 minutes . gimme a break .
american	came to nickel 's cuz i couldn 't waste anymore time for lunch . the thing about nickels they are always blow average or average food wise . if you not in the mood for mcdonald 's or a & w type of food then there fine. the soup of the day was surprisingly good chicken cream of something . took the fish and chips not that good . didn 't taste fresh at all but what did i honestly expect ¿ i tried a few nickels now i 'm always disappointed in the food service was good i like old school look . unfortunately for me i don 't think i 'll ever eat at a nickels any more way better places out there .
american	had the pastrami sandwich which had a lot of fries , but hardly any pastrami . the fries weren 't very good either -- took them off and was left with a sub-par sandwich .
american	it 's simple - they turn you away at the door . we arrived at 7 : 45pm , well-dressed , and sober without a reservation . we were told there was no available seating for the entire evening . it was interesting to be staring at three empty tables and an open bar , to be told they had no room . could we sit at the bar ? nope . no room . i was not aware that the " french laundry " had made its way to chandler . jeez .
american	we have been here an hour and still haven 't got our food . food was old , dry and cold . better food at a dive bar .
american	as my mama used to say , it takes one to know one . on to the food . sub-par , at best , and that 's being kind . ordered a burger , greasy with a bun to soak it up and fall apart . the bun is apparently not meant to be eaten , it 's meant to sponge up the grease . if you 've got money to burn and want to rubberneck on a disaster , go here . if you want to eat good food , dine elsewhere . the only thing keeping this place afloat is the fact that it 's a punchline to a very bad joke .
american	waitress and bar staff extremely rude . they literally ignored repeat patrons because apparently a $ 2 tip on an $ 8 bill isn 't enuf for lousy service .
american	tonight my family and i were treated to dinner in the very loud bar area , as there was a large post-work party of about 15 people there that was being incredibly loud and rude to the other patrons dining there . however , nobody from the restaurant intervened or asked them to quiet down . this provided for a very unsatisfactory dining experience for my family . in addition , service was scant ... basically get the order , drop the food , pick up the dirty plates , no drink refills or other pleasantries .
american	other than that , jimmy johns is a great-quick sandwich shop . however , this location fails at customer service and quality .
american	the menu choices are fairly extensive , but to me it 's a close relative of a jason 's deli-type joint , but with higher prices . the service has never been fantastic - though to be fair , it 's never been terrible ... so i guess right in line with my 2 star rating . my girlfriend was on a kick of liking this place for a while , and i suffered through it a few times for her sake , but luckily i 've been able to avoid it recently . perhaps we 'll go for breakfast , after which i will gladly eat my words ( and change my review ) if it 's significantly better .
american	" quality control " was their reason . i think it 's their " cooks " can 't understand how to leave an egg on the grill 30 second longer . horrible customer service . this is on top of waiting 30 minutes to order and another 30 minutes for food . do not eat here .
american	their salad is fantastic and so is the bread that comes with it . however , the first floor and bathrooms always smell like sewage . the last time i was there the ceiling was leaking and kept dripping on us and bc the restaurant was packed we had to demand to be moved to another table . in fact , this restaurant always feels straight up dirty . the food is just ' alright , ' but there are a few standout items like the omelette and the wedding soup .
american	a bit pretentious all around . my medium meat was well done , in both cooking time and salt content . tomato bisque soup was consistency of paste . service was genuinely disingenuous . stay home , have a hot pocket . at least it 'll be hot and tasty .
american	waitress was extremely rude . told us we were eating too many unlimited wings and the restaurant wasn 't making money .
american	it tasted like a thin , greasy , fried crepe . i prefer my pancakes light , fluffy , and melting in my mouth . seeing as how the pancakes are the main attraction , i 'm not in a hurry to go back . the service was average to slow , due to the large crowds , and the decor & atmosphere is just ok .
american	as a vegan who use to love going there , i got up and left last night after waiting over 20 min to even be seated , and about another 5 min before the waitress even saw us . they replaced the boca burger with some quinoa and oats patty , to most likely save a dollar , but it was definitely the wrong decision . i would rather pay a little more and eat a boca burger than some random thing they tossed together and called a burger . my family will not be customers anymore unless they bring the boca burgers back .
american	what a disappointment and a waste of a great concept ...
american	apparently taking an order is really hard waitress is an idiot i waited an hour for my food , i should of just went to metro pizza .
american	also seems like no one under the age of 50 goes here -- just an fyi .
american	came here from out of town looking for a fun , laid back , delicious craft brew spot and got stuck in a dark corner of the brewery with the longest wait times in the kitchen . cesar salad was ok , the rib appetizer smelled better cooking outside than what it tasted ( they are essentially riblets , not a rack or anything like that ) . we ordered another food item but it was so lackluster i can 't even remember what it was . : (
american	it pains me to provide this once fine establishment with 1 out of 5 stars .
american	i mean , there are banners posted against the building outside , there are signs above the slot machines ... the hooters hotel is supposed to have 24-hour $ 3 blackjack tables . my friend and i walked into the hooters hotel . we looked for these $ 3 blackjack tables . we circled the casino three times . there were no $ 3 blackjack tables . one star for false promotions . ( i was looking forward to cheap gambling too ! )
american	the patio bartender was more interested in socializing than service . after watching 3 waitress ' hang out at the bar and ignore customers my husband decided to go to the bar and order for us . our waitress did not show up until my husband brought our drinks back to our table.food was good / average for bar food but the service will keep us away . maybe this is why phoenix was rated as 7th in poor ( rude ) customer service as reported by channel 15 . i think they can and should do better , especially on a non-crowded monday night .
american	too much to ask for a sub , though we weren 't given a reason or even a weak apology . they might just want to disclose that somewhere . customer service is always pretty poor , but since it 's up the street we 've put up with it , but after a year we 're done .
american	i 'm so sad and disappointed . the new employees don 't seem as friendly and quality has gone downhill . the bacon in my bagel sandwich seemed like it was vegan cardboard meat . i was actually afraid to eat it and risk food poisoning . they also did away with the punch card all of the locals were used to . the bagels aren 't as good . i won 't be returning . i tried to call four times prior to posting the review to see if i could tell them about my experience but no answer . i used to eat here once or twice a week to pickup food for the whole family- just sad .
american	apparently the turkey burger is good , i wouldn 't know though as they brought me a chicken breast on a bun when i ordered it ....
american	this chuck e cheese is the closest to our home and i 'd have to say it 's one of the smallest locations we 've ever been to .
american	my wife and i walked in today and sat at the bar for 5 minutes while the bartender talked to a local news celebrity . apparently he was so enamored with her that he could not bother to tear himself away to wait on us . after waiting for close to five minutes , we just got up and walked away and he didn 't even try to stop us . must be good times over the cork & cleaver where money is not needed from customers other than local celebrities .
american	the salad i had was so bland . i couldn 't even taste the bacon bits , and the dressing was watery for a blue cheese . the ingredients weren 't the freshest , and the coffee was terrible . music and ambience is where the two stars come from . i kinda like the hipster vibe . it 's dank ... i dig on that . go there for the drinks , but unless you 're getting fries , skip it .
american	i guess we 'll be going to capriotti 's from now on .
american	hostess claimed 30 minute wait despite many empty tables and no people that looked like they were being seated . found room at the bar and were totally ignored by the bar staff for at least 15 minutes before we decided to bail and go to a better beer bar ( c 'est what ) ! pretty sure i will never bother wasting my time at bier markt again ! unless i 'm in cleveland , mcnultys bier markt cleveland is the bomb !
american	this is the worst steak i 've ever had .
american	bring the cost of a reg fat burger meal to over $ 13 . yea sorry fat burger your dreaming of you think you can charge that for your burgers with 5 guys right across the street . fat burger you fired ! i doubt this location and its owners will be here very long . bye felicia ! 5guys here i come
american	also , there were 8 games that were not working . we were surprised when we arrived and there were a dozen top patrons during the summer , after playing for a bit we knew why . my 10 year old stated that chuck e cheese was no longer the place where a kid could be a kid . how sad , ! ! ! we will find somewhere else to enjoy games , etc .
american	apparently , this 24 / 7 steak n ' shake doesn 't answer the drive thru or the phone at night .
american	service was friendly but the food was pathetic to say the least . this truly isn 't a restaurant but a bar without even good bar food is the sad part . not sure the person who dreamed up the lobster roll has ever actually seen a lobster roll but montauk 's is anything but a lobster roll . twenty bucks for some horrible lobster salad smeared on a roll and some oily house chips !
american	i did not think it was that great . the food was ok , shakes are better elsewhere and spent as much as i would have at a full serve restaurant .
american	eh . it was alright . the idea of fries and cole slaw on a sandwich ended up not being as exciting as i had hoped . i don 't know if i 'm just used to good ol ' southern hospitality but the waitress was not friendly . she seemed put out when my friend and i asked for menus ( how dare people in a super touristy spot not know exactly what they want ? ! ) and she never bothered to ask if we needed refills on drinks and we had to hunt her down to get our bill . this seems like something to experience once but i see no need to return next time i 'm in town .
american	who knew . doesn 't say anywhere on the website and sure is no indication that the menu has changed also but alas , it has . no more reindeer sausage , the only reason i made the 20 minute drive . sat down at the bar and waited over 10 minutes for a menu and only got it after i asked for it to then be told that it is still under construction and 1 / 2 the stuff isn 't available yet . and yes , no more reindeer sausage . so we got up and left after asking for the check and not getting a pen to sign the receipt . what a disappointment . one star was generous .
american	i just can 't get into the jar of mayonnaise , shredded lettuce and tasteless meat they put into their burgers . gourmet burgers my ass . fries were great , spinach and artichoke dip was great . i guess i 'll eat vegetarian here .
american	i don 't mean to sound like an elitist prick i 'm far from it . but when you 've been living in scottsdale for close to a decade and play a course the first time with that price tag on it you expect close to perfection . greens were slow and course was overall in mediocre shape . i understand everyone is going thru or just ending their overseed process but to charge what they do in the condition it 's in is a joke . for the price i would much rather play we-ko-pa or troon north if i 'm spending the money .
american	so thennnnn my gf got to finish the order and we waited for 15 mins ... so if your not black prepare to get waited last . ps true story
american	definitely too much of the condiments . by the time in my car and opened my gigantic sub that i was so excited about , it had soaked the entire way thru and the meat just fall off the floppy , soggy , sipping wet bun . i had to literally wipe off my arms after each bite . i gave up . later i toasted the bread in the oven to try to rejuvenate half of the sub but had to toss all the toppings . i just felt i had to eat some of it ... since i had spent $ 13 on a hoagie chips and drink . waste of money . and the steak was pretty gross and grissely too .
american	my husband grew up with mr. hero or my reference is ' that romanburger place ' . i 'm a big fan of burger and fry joints , this place just doesn 't do it for me . the romanburger is basically a cheeseburger ( not a great one ) with a piece of ham on it and for some reason , i think that 's this places biggest draw . now , if my husband or in-laws were to read this review , i 'm sure ... rather , i know , they would beg to differ with my rating .
american	tried this place a 2nd time . it was around 3 pm and it was only half as busy as the first time we went , there were at least 4-6 empty booths in the restaurant and we were still quoted a 2 hour wait . i can understand that for the huge table in the middle that was reserved for a party , but not having all those tables sitting empty while people are standing there waiting . seems very much like a ploy to get you to play games while you wait , but we just left . might give them one more typical down the road but if it 's just like the first two times we 'll be done with them .
american	service : everyone was friendly and helpful . food : ordered chicken and waffles . waffle was cold and tasteless . chicken batter was good , but chicken taste like there was no seasoning on the chicken prior to being battered . just bland !
american	six inch sub with dry meat , $ 11 . all sides cost $ 3 to go along with your entree . decent food with small portions , weird atmosphere , and one of the most overpriced experiences i have had in a long time . definitely will not be going back .
american	however , an hour wait for food with not more than 10 people in restaurant is not satisfactory . there was a very nice waitress , who had to greet and seat , wait and bus tables . management had no presence . i suggest they change that if they want to stay in business .
american	only 1 person liked their food ( the burger ) . not sure why the reviews were so high but we will not be giving it a second chance . however , our waitress and hostess were very nice .
american	entrees were awful , service didn 't seem interested in helping us . actually sent an entree back , it was that awful . place is cute and good ambiance , but all that stops there . not much good to say about the place other than its cute and in a good location .
american	they cannot get them right . out of 6 meals , 2 were ok not fantastic . the linguine in clam sauce was highly recommended by the waiter , when it arrived - only 8 over cooked clams on each plate . supporting restaurants in our neighborhood is important , if the were good we would be in once a week . after 3 + bad dining experiences done with dinner or lunch - drinks and apps. only .
american	appetizers are great , amazing caesar salad & shrimp cocktail , drinks are great , but we had a 20 person dinner with a variety of main dishes orders and it was all mediocre at best
american	hamburgers bland and buns dry and cold . server forgot our endless frys . and gave us the wrong check . first time , last time . i don 't see what 's the attraction .
american	the pita is yummy . 2 stars beer cheese : bread is soaked in butter . cheese tastes not very fondue-y . 2.5 stars short rib : crazy salty , 1 star chicken & dumplings : tasty and fresh but chicken is suuuuper dry , like i ate around it . 2.5 stars . service : good this was 110 $ dinner than felt like a 40 $ dinner at best . although we were vocal about our food problems , and my husband didnt eat his 30 $ shortrib , no effort was made to assuage our disappointment , no offer of desert , nada . won 't be back
american	regardless , quality was subpar . patties on sliders were overcooked and the nacho platter lacked meat even with additional meat ordered with meal . i have not given the entrées a try , but the appetizers were a let down . bartender was polite , but not engaging at all . the facility itself is nice , but that 's not enough to have me come back for low quality food .
american	the pizzas were mediocre . we had several and they pretty much tasted the same . the service was blasé and the gratuity was included so absolutely no motivation to be the least bit attentive . dinette was not a good dining experience ... kind of sad .
american	the waitresses were nice , but there were only two and it seemed like that wasn 't enough for the large amount of guests on a weekend-night . i 'd recommend it for the treats , but i don 't think i 'll be coming back for a sit down meal .
american	the steaks were dry , not much flavor , and over priced . the waitress misled my girlfriend about ordering her steak . she originally asked for a $ 26 steak , but we ended up with a $ 51 steak on our bill . the waitress took no responsibility for this mixup and was rude when i asked about it . i would not go again , and i would not recommend getting any of the steaks . if you do , make sure you are 100 % clear on which one you order , some of them have similar names . and they will undoubtedly charge you for the more expensive one .
american	french fries soggy and cold , less than mediocre at best . moscow mule is good . they have nice ping pong tables . i got the prime rib sandwich , pretty good . asking for a napkin that was not provided at the start was a real effort for our server to fetch . overall very unimpressed with the restaurant and the attention we received and would not recommend for sit down food service . if you are set on coming here , don 't expect to get what you order , be prepared to wait a long time to be seated , and don 't plan on wanting to come back .
american	grilled lobster tails came out raw , they did bring another serving , these too were barely cooked .. the halibut was similar to chewing on a shoe . for the prices they charge we will not be going back . it seems like everyone who goes there has been brainwashed to think they are getting a good meal .
american	it was overlooked and dried out . the cobb salad was ordinary and tasteless . tasted as if it had been made a couple days ago . the waitress was nice and attentive . as many restaurants as there are here , there must be a couple better !
american	if i can give a half star i would . we had a fair size party of 6 adults 4 children .. we were celebrating graduation and mother 's day .. to begin with we waited an hour to be seated , and the restaurant was empty ! ! then wated 30 min to get served drinks .. i even called the manager over who helped with our drinks .. half of us got our food and the other half got cold food and our orders were not correct . we left with half the party not eating .. the general manager did end up comping our check ... but i will never eat at an applebees again ! ! !
american	applebee 'sesque , below average to average with poorly trained asu wait staff .
american	we had dinner there last night ... what a huge disappointment ! the service was awful ... my hamburger was ordered pink it was gray ! they forgot my daughters salad ... they made a reference to my mother in laws bake potato they were going to serve her was rotten so it would be a few minutes to bring a fresh one . please avoid this applebee 's at all cost i will never return there again and warn everyone i know to do the same .
american	i was really craving one so i got curbside to go and they gave me the butt of the bread . wtf ? i just paid $ 10 for a sandwich and its half the size because it 's the butt as well as being the butt - which was stiff and thick . gross , i 'll be checking my food from now on before i pay . i understand saving money but nobody would want the butt of the bread , consider your guests . they always have extremely slow service inside too . : (
american	i was trying to enjoy a celebratory dinner with my son , grand kids & my ex-wife bit couldn 't even do that ! my order was wrong ! i specifically asked for no onions on my bourbon steak & the waitress kept arguing back n ' forth with me that i didnt ! & thats when i went to dig in to my cobb salad & found a whole rat in my salad ! feces & everything ! no wonder the damn ninja turtles couldn 't find master splinter .. stay far away from this or any applebee 's as they certainly aren 't up to food standards
american	applebees is a good place to go the service is great and the drinks are good and great places especially happy hour they have these amazing wong tan tacos but there wings and cheese sticks are horrible the marinara and cheese sticks are always cold and the wings suck they deffinately need to know how to make wings i make better ones at home that people would pay money for
american	applebees is one of my favorite restaurants ever , i always get the chicken and shrimp bourbon street we 'll never been to this location and unfortunately i don 't think ill ever go back to applebees again ... spent $ 50 + to get food poisoning .... absolutely horrible .
american	i really don 't understand why anyone would choose to eat at this chain . i had no choice , i was basically forced at gunpoint by co-workers . the tables were sticky , the service was slow and my food was served cold . i didn 't even bother complaining because i expected it . bleh . don 't order the tomato soup !
american	this one is very basic and easy to describe . like all other applebee 's serivce is decent , nothing over the top food is somewhat infrequently in quality but maintains portions .
american	this time was not so good . soup had to reheated in microwave . pretzel appetizers looked like they were from last week - hard at the ends and all wrinkled . table beside us had same issue . kids ordered milkshakes - they tasted like milk in shaved ice . they were so terrible the kids didn 't even take a second sip . music was so loud you couldn 't hold a conversation - had to ask twice to have it lowered even then it was to loud for 5pm . hoping our next visit will be better .
american	food was cold it all wasn 't that great . i personally would definitely not go here again .
american	i make homemade wheat pancakes at home all the time and they are never gritty . they need a new recipe , i think . it is ok for breakfast , but nothing special . for the price , there are better , but there are worse .
american	first impression ; not overly friendly ( that lame 20 something ; too cool to be working here attitude ) . nice piece of chicken , don 't enjoy the sauce ( odb ; maybe get it on the side ) , waffle is standard , didn 't care for the slaw . at $ 16.95 for a piece of chicken and waffle ; equals a ' one time ' experience ; it 's way too expensive . consider some specials , daily deals , etc .. across the border ( buffalo , detroit ) ; you can get this done similar / better for way less ; i guess in toronto you are paying for the experience , i guess ....
american	appreciate the decor of this place but the coffee is not worth the trip .... 3.75 for a latte that didn 't taste all that great and nowhere as good as commonplace coffee .
american	our entrees on our most recent visit were disappointing but i 've been here and enjoyed the food before ... restaurant is usually pretty understaffed i assume to maximize profits but having tables sit dirty for an hour is very unbecoming .... i want to like it here there 's just too much inconsistency ....
american	there are 2 " hostesses " but open seating ? but found an open table ... that was cleared but not wiped off . was told they were so busy ( with open tables all over ) that the kitchen was backed up a half hour . the waitress came over about every 20 minutes . my wife was served a salad with no dressing , and it took about 15 minutes to get some . i would come back ... on wednesday afternoons . try the fish .
american	bbq was decent but served room temperature . i guess they cook during the day and place in hold for evening service . what was really odd was the bbq sauce . inedible , basically vinegar with rosemary . rosemary ? ? ? sometimes a good homemade bbq sauce can make up for any deficiencies in the actual bbq , but this was bad enough that i don 't see myself returning .
american	not unusual for airport pricing . turkey club sandwich was just okay , hard bread topped with a ton of avocado , which made for a messy mid-flight meal . i vaguely remember having a burger here once during a flight delay at their dine-in counter , and it was unremarkable . might be better for liquid libations instead .
american	nothing terrible , nothing i 'd go back for . eggs florentine comes with raw spinach , though the eggs were perfectly cooked . breakfast quesadilla is huge and bland . coffee refills are slow . next time , i 'll walk across the street to easy .
american	the people are pretty nice . i only ever go for breakfast and i 'm rarely disappointed . they have a pretty good variety of things to pick from . overall , this place is run of the mill but good every once in a while .
american	the kids liked it and it 's definitely family friendly .
american	the biggest highlight is that you can pay a little extra and visit for all your meal needs and that links with excalibur 's buffet as well . they do have a large selection but they don 't replace the trays nearly enough so the food sits out and gets cold . i will say , it wasn 't horrible , i 've just had better . would i go again ? yes . would it be my first choice ? no .
american	i admit to being a food snob , but i do occasionally dine at chain restaurants still . $ 24 got me a 12oz sirloin with 2 sides . it was cooked to order , but nothing to write about . my buddies got the ribs and seemed satisfied with them . the highlight of the meal was my $ 7.99 32 oz coors light draft .
american	firstly , making me sit and wait for 14 minutes for a table to open up ( there were at least half the tables empty ) . the greeters and servers were third rate , unfriendly , old and bitter . here is a suggestion if you do not enjoy customers find and an alternate career to service . the food matched the service . overpriced and below average . a miserable experience .
american	right on . might as well mention lepeep and other bland , vanilla , overcrowded " restaurants " too . all i will say is this : until you 've had a waitress dripping with sweat ( dripping ! ) deliver your food , you can 't complain . so , i guess we can complain . grow up ... go someplace real .
american	a problem happend with my order two times and i got a call it was the manger this was funky wierd and then she was harassing me the women manger was a fucking weirdo i don 't know why she called my phone like i did something bad they really like to pay attention to the people there the people that work there are funky weird and two times i had a problem with my tailgate order i better go 10 miles more than come to these funky people rednecks
american	always good when you 're craving some beef ! no gripes but no props really . just writing a review for posterity 's sake . came here for a bite when we were moving into the new nicer place . one thing that is awesome sauce is , well , their horseradish sauce . always keep it , never discontinue it pls tks dmo out
american	the meat tastes unreal like it came from a polyester cow or something . i have yet to get anything at arby 's that i like . it is one of those places one goes with the crowd not because you want too .
american	2 for $ 6 french dip is supposed to be 1lb of food . another reason i never eat fast food , such a ripoff btw these are supposed to be a 1 / 2 lbs each . according to the scale these are 7 ozs or 0.4375 lbs i should have known it was too good to be true . the sandwich is horrible on top of it .
american	think high in calories , fat and sodium . more than other fast food outlets . fries are tasty , potato cakes are unique and good . service is timely and friendly . this location is clean and pleasant . too bad the food can 't match up .
american	i used to come here several times a week . they used to have this mouth-watering roast chicken club sandwich on their menu for years , and they got rid of it . recently , they had these fantastic gyros they advertised a lot on tv . they got rid of those too , seemingly in record time ! apparently , they have switched over to a special ' short attention span menu ' ! by the time one ends up discovering and liking something on an arby 's menu , they discontinue it ! and the service is not what it used to be . most dissapointing . they 've lost me as a customer .
american	went for brunch on mothers day with a friend after trying to go to another crowded place up the street . i had bacon and eggs with a pancake side , she had the veggie burger . we were both quite full after the meal but there was nothing terrible remarkable for either of us , my food tasted as if it sat in the window for a while , the eggs were lukewarm , and the potatoes were almost cold to the touch , as was the toast . the staff seemed friendly , and were reasonably attentive .
american	they have deals on the car washes occasionally but if it 's not a car wash or just something quick to drink i really don 't spend money here . like everyone else 's complaint about this $ 0.35 debit card fee i don 't believe in paying that just to get gas . they come off as cheaper and then you factor is that snazzy little fee . also i don 't even know about how the true quality of the gas is that comes from the pump . if it 's not chevron or shell i do not put it in my car .. period ..
american	below average service and food . the strip steak was fatty and seemed to be boiled in butter . yuck . the wine was red and delish .
american	really sloppy - their dress , their presentation , their view on food / service , etc , etc , etc just ok service - rushed and unrefined the food is good , but it is not great by any stretch . you experience is overshadowed by the management / service . find your good customers and don 't rush them . overpriced even for vegas . no regulars here , but just tourists who are drawn in unknowingly . 2 years and the location will likely turnover to-another entureprienoer . not worth a return trip based on the management , presentation , price , rushed service and poor leadership . too many other great options .
american	thought with the name biscuits in the name , the biscuits would be good . i was wrong , they were obviously not fresh or made on site . i recommend not ordering the biscuits .
american	took a client to cp with high recommendations from the concierge from the the cosmopolitan hotel . should have not trusted it as she was a millennial ( clueless ) . could have gotten a better steak from outback and for a fraction of the cost . sides were were small and wine list inflated . i wouldn 't recommend . i have eaten at great steak houses all over the country and charlie palmer is not one . update : if charlie palmer wants to know what a fine steak house experience is like , they should visit mastro 's steakhouse in scottsdale . they are as good as it gets .
american	this place is too touristy and really does not reflect montréal 's great brunch offerings . it 's a diner style but made to look fancy , it 's just really confusing . the portions are huge especially for its price even though the price ranges from $ 15 and up . it 's hard to finish your food . the food quality is all right not too bad but i 've had so much better in montreal . i really like their fruit skewers though. there 's a very spooky bathroom
american	i went with my fiancé before a movie and they completely messed up her order . ordered her yellowtail blackened but it came out grilled . ordered the zucchini but instead got mac n cheese . the waitress offered to send it back , but we already short on time and i couldn 't continue to wait for a new meal . the food was ok , but it didn 't stand out so much to make up for the mixups for the order . maybe you will have better luck , but we won 't be back .
american	a really overly snobby and pretensious attempt at a posh la style eatery. very boring and overpriced .
american	an almost empty place at 1 pm on a monday should have been a clue . wait staff was slow , could not get orders correct , food took 25 minutes and then one of the dishes was inedible , which took another 15 minutes . do yourself a favor , skip this location of wild wings .
american	four dinners , three ok one cooked poorly . a grilled salmon that could have been used for shoe leather . would have sent it back but the waiter was so absent that never had the chance . when they cleared the table , i told them the salmon was bad and the manager took an appetizer off the bill but not the poorly cooked meal . a disappointing dinner experience . too many other good places to eat nearby to go back here .
american	the chatter by the staff should have been had after their shift . the server was constantly changing , some were very nice , some were iffy . food was ok , nothing spectacular . portions were large , so much so that both my friend and i took part of our meal home . varied menu in a nice , diner environment but they are very much focused on the regular customers at the price of the occasional visitor . overall , i 've seen nicer wimpy 's diners .
american	my gf and i were not impressed . the meat ( steak and chicken ) were overcooked . the fries are amazing though . i would come here if you wanted some really good fries but definitely not for the gyros .
american	food was fair at best and cocktails were sugary . felt like disney .
american	are here for lunch and breakfast , and both times the food was good but too high priced .
american	ordered a medium burger that came well done . burger was not only overcooked but boring with stale bread and fries were nothing special . my coworker had veggie burger and said it was not great either . would not eat here for lunch again but i heard breakfast is good .
american	had the eggs benedict the first time . the english muffin was dry , the eggs were overcooked , and there wasn 't enough sauce on top . the second visit i thought i would try there famous biscuits and gravy which they claim is the best . don 't waste your time . they put bacon and maple syrup in them and it throws off the taste . there 's just something missing from them , maybe salt ? staff was friendly except for the tattooed host that would occasionally bully them .
american	perhaps it is the fact that this one is right across the street from case western reserve university , yet on the few times i have gone in , i have never seen any college students . very strange , and maybe i am just not going at the right time . the fries were overdone today , which is a big mcd 's no-no .
american	and the cheeses burgers we ordered were bland and nothing special . i dont think i would have a reason to go back .
american	this was horrific . the food came out burnt twice . the server knew it was burnt . service was extremely slow . food was terrible .
american	as everyone else wrote , this is like a woodsy , hunting cabin style of hooters . , t & a with half assed beer . my wife i and ordered the blt with the tomato soup and french fries . the blt was completely tasteless and salty , as well as everything else ( except the beer ) ... to sum up ; bj is right next door and blows them away .. we will not be back ! ! !
american	" great place for a group to drink and play games but i was totally underwhelmed by the food . pretzels did not have the right texture and were more like bread rolls than anything else , butternut squash pasta was undercooked and had practically no flavors other than the sweetness of the squash . i 'd come back to give other menu items a shot but my first go around was really unimpressive .
american	a loner in the city which has no equal . quality service but the food did not match either the prices or the service level . i ordered mussels as an appetizer . they came with 2 tablespoons of broth . they were characterless with no taste . my main branzini was overcooked and over buttered . i can see vibo probably has a loyal clientele who enjoy the 90 's era and that sure is culinary democracy . suresh chawla toronto
american	shrimp kisses were great . however the kitchen struggled to have entrees match what the menu described . the coffee machine didn 't work . and what was served was cold . staff brought out inappropriate eating utensils with the beverages and dessert .
american	the food isn 't too bad . we had some pizza , it was cheap and good at happy hour prices . the beer , well , it 's drinkable . they have about 8-10 types . i stuck to the " blonde " flavor . it 's good and drinkable - the rest suck . come for the food and hard liquor - i think they have it . but as for beer , and the current fad and craze of " good " craft beers being offered up at every other bar in the world , go to another bar for the beer .
american	i ate there twice because i wanted to give them a second chance ... mistake . the fish was overcooked and dry ( both times ) and the lobster was rubbery . it was such a let down . the lobster bisque that costco sells is far better than the bland version at kings . they did have a decent california roll though . i was disappointed and will avoid this place in the future .
american	a resto-bar-lounge in the financial district boasting tons of beers i came in for beer some time around ten o 'clock uh , p.m. of course quite the loud ambiance clubby-loungey vibe. it 's just ... not for me i guess waitstaff punch orders into their apple ipads looks kinda awkward standard beer pricing ' round seven to eight a pint great local choices some late night specials such as demi-priced pizza might be worth trying you 'd prob ' find me at beerbistro just down the street but hey , that 's just me
american	i think this movie on tv right now called " big miracle " is better .
american	are there food that is not-true ? ok ... i got it , food has to be true to the original taste ... which mean it doesn 't always taste good , i supposed .... had the shrimp spring rolls .... turkey bolognese ... could be true to the ingredient but not true to the dish of how it should taste .... fit very much in the north scottsdale vibe .... ' look at me , i only eat healthy , organic , true and whole food ' ... which actually could be a good thing ; )
american	lady 's room the same . really needs a cleaning and face lift .. too bad because it is hard to find restaurants open after 8pm . food was just ok , we probably won 't come back .
american	when we asked for more napkins ( twice ) a small stack of bar drink napkins were tossed on the table . we had to ask twice for one guest 's broccoli casserole , and what was finally delivered was inedible ! meals came out at widely variable times . men 's bathroom was filthy and one sink was shattered . floor was ridiculous . this in a saturday early evening . we won 't be back , despite this being a family favorite for years . yuch .
american	no judgment , but do it on your own time ... had to talk to three idiots to place a delivery order . cold pizza delivered ... hardly any toppings ... thanks for the $ 1.50 charge for " fresh tomatoes " which there were hardly any of . the worst was the crust ! sooo yeasty tasting ... like you just drank a cheap beer ! oh and they can 't split payments ... why ? what pos system in 2015 doesn 't allow you to split payment between two cards ? even square will allow . just a gross experience all around . and way over priced for the taste and quality . yuck !
american	pita bread was stale gyros heated up in a toaster oven ? ! please insert throwing up emoji here .
american	it felt like i was somewhere in eastern europe . is this really a greek restaurant or has it changed hands ? just asking , i remember it being good and want to try it again . help ! the servers kept insisting that i order the $ 20 buffett , the guy was annoyed that i wanted to order from the menu . the food was not that good , i di pay the $ 20 it was not worth it . again , mostly albanians running the place . i guess the only greek is the name . hope that the food and service improves .
american	this place is horrible ! i am down to eat a delicious 5 thousand calorie burger any day , but not if it tastes like crap ! i paid 16 dollars for a giant old tasting burger that had flavorless meat and came with disgusting soggy fries that look like burnt fingers ! it 's dirty and a tourist trap ! too bad too ! everyone love a good burger ! never again heart attack grill !
american	gone are all the sandwiches that had stuffed banana peppers on them , gone are the soft pita 's that used to come with the spinach artichoke dip , gone is the side salad that was mixed greens with croutons on it . we sent it all back and cancelled our orders of the chicken little and triple bypass . i 'm not about to waste a night with all disappointing food . go there at your own risk , do not expect the same food as last time you wre there .... ! you 've been warned ... ! ! !
american	" if that 's your thing , fine . what i contest is the tasteless burger . i had probably three bites of bread before my taste buds , teeth , or tongue even found the burger . then , it was lukewarm , wet from water not grease , square molded as in frozen and thawed perhaps ? it wasn 't worth finishing .
american	no water . no cream served with coffee , few , customers , and lots is wait staff . after a long half hour wait , another server ( not mine ) brings out my side of bacon . the not-so-happy-ending is about to arrive ten minutes later : cold entree . hate to say i told you so !
american	really pissed off came here with 2 friends for a small grad dinner . mind there about 5 servers on the floor one checked our id and ordered drinks i forgot her name just like she forgot about our table for 20 mins . we 're sitting there trying to get the other servers attention that 's just walking around looking for things to do rather than doing something . terrible service .
american	food is considered " edgy " thanks to salt . lots of it . bartenders think they 're in williamsburg serving ben affleck , when in fact they 're just massive jerks on a power trip over your $ 3 in change .
american	i get home and my cheeseburger was disgusting ! fries disgusting ! i just want to know what 's going on with mcdonald 's !
american	in fact , if i could give it zero stars , that 's what i 'd do . terrible service . and someone was having a big screaming match in the back , so they turned the music up to try to drown them out . tough , disgusting , dry , overcooked excuse of lamb kabob with sides that weren 't any better . decor = -1 . service = -1 . screaming match = -5 . food = -1 if you want good kabobs there are way better places to go . yuck . place seems to be under new ownership and the location looked different . i wonder if my past review was confused about locale or if this one is .
american	are you fricking kidding me ? ? ? first you drop the mac n cheese ? then you drop the tilapia ? now you drop the panko breaded shrimp ? what 's next ? water ? or worse yet , the chocolate cappuccino cake ? who 's making these decisions anyway ? ?
american	red rock casino is always packed on friday nights . if your the owner of pink 's and you are reading this review , do us all a favor and permanently close down this location as you clearly do not understand how to operate a restaurant in las vegas .
american	do not eat here . disgusting . ordered 3 sandwiches . it cost 40 $ . my sandwich the " triple decker cornflake chicken " was burnt , freezing cold and on soggy cheap grocery store bread , not a bun as you would expect from a restaurant . my husband 's sandwiches were undercooked pemeal also on cheap dollar bread . made completely wrong . thank god uber was able to refund us .
american	took them 10 minutes to seat the two people in line ahead of me and for the next 5 minutes i was passed by at least 4 other servers before the lady behind the bar ( who was swamped with phone orders ) came up for air and said she would try to help me in a few . i 'm assuming that meant hours because i continued to wait ( stubbornly at this point ) and be ignored by the same servers still passing back and forth in front of me . don 't waste your time here .
american	" the previous visit , i ordered a spinach pasta salad with fresh mozzarella . the mozzarella was completely spoiled to the point it was yellow and hardened . i could not believe that someone would actually slice it and serve it . i also noticed the inability to maintain fresh mushrooms , hence the now " roasted mushrooms " in the otherwise cold ingredient salad . btw - update the image on the menu !
american	i 've had my car washed better at a drive thru self wash . there was no full service here just a full service rip off .
american	so everything was pre made . tasted less than any fast food chain except at twice the price . popeyes has them beat hands down . now i know why there were many of these around years ago and only one survived . i guess people like going because it 's been there so long . don 't waste your time or money
american	i moved to gilbert and had to try a taste of home . the hot dog was so over cooked it was inedible . the beef looked and tasted steamed . no flavor . rubbery . the gyros tasted microwaved . not a good thing . the smart thing to do would be to turn this place into a laundromat .
american	booked a table for st. pat 's weeks ago . got a call last night , the night before st. pat 's , that they could not guarantee we would get a table and may just have to stand . they were expecting a large crowd-wow an irish bar is busy on st. pat 's-who would have thunk it ? ! that was why we made reservations ! ! ! ! ! * * update * * just got a message from cole-the owner inviting me to enjoy a comped meal to make up for the open table debacle . great customer service and follow-up .
american	horridly slow service . terrible coffee . reconstituted powered eggs . extremely over-priced ... will never come back here . do yourself a favor and just get a muffin from the starbucks on property for breakfast . i 'd give this place zero stars if i could ! it was probably the lowest point of the whole weekend .
american	not one thing . the texture of the sandwich was foul and it was so greasy i was nauseous for the next 4 hours .
american	? ? ? every time i am here the service is so slow . about 5-8 people in line and instead of both employees serving customers , one is restocking the sandwiches , water etc. which doesn 't really need restocking . so frustrating ! ! ummmm people have flights to catch and waiting 20 mins ! ! ! ! twenty ! ! ! ! for a tea is ridiculous . if i could give it zero stars i would . update : never got to order because the airline called my name to board . seriously horrible .
american	it is fast food bbq . if you want a mcrib and mcdonalds is not serving them go here . do not go here if you want real bbq . this place sucks !
american	a petting zoo it is not . gross . i hope the money really goes to feeding these poor animals .
american	the bartender asked us if we were sure we wanted to leave as the manager would probably comp the meal due to the unacceptable service ( her words ) so we stayed , put the order in as the server apparently never placed the order . 15 mins later we got a meal . i figured they would comp the meal as they messed up sooo bad but they didn 't and gave us a bill . management is a mess up and the server is a mess up . wonder what the turn over is like as the management was lecturing our server prior to this about taking other customers orders .
american	no water , no " hi , i 'll be right with you , " or nothing . left the restaurant and no one even noticed-except the hostess who walked us to our table , who told us to have a nice night . * eyeroll * i really am disappointed bc i wanted to try this place and had been waiting but due to the low quality service it will not be happening . cpk never disappoints and is literally a 3 minute walk
american	if you don 't mind waiting over an hour and having your order be incorrect then this is the place for you . servers with attitude should be sent home , not left on the floor to ruin people 's evenings .
american	? ! went to the car wash , $ 5 and the car is still incredibly dirty . there are no brushes , so the water just managed to blow the top layer of dust off . i 'm livid !
american	could not believe how salty it was .... enjoyed the oysters the most . but even with this , found bits of shell in my last oyster . too much hype . was an early fan but , for what you pay for , not going back ..
american	they have absolutely no personality whatsoever , no clue about customer service . i would never come to this one as long as the current management is available . now , to be fair , wingstops in tucson are actually exceptional . the people down there know what customer service is all about . thank you ...
american	are you looking for a sausage fest full of pretentious people ? you found it .
american	also to have packets of powdered parmesan that were shown to me but never added to the order . when i got it home the whole thing was a sopping mess with the sauce at the bottom of the bag all over my napkins and no parmesan . unlikely you will ever see me again .
american	and why would you sell mac n cheetos then bring them back they taste like . go out of business
american	stop putting sugar in the gravy ! ! ! ! cali can 't do pizza ! ! ! ! nasty ! !
american	just go to paris buffet . yes the have fewer choices but it doesnt suck like the spice market .
american	why did i come back ! ! i just love the ambiance of this place , i want the food and service to match ! ! after having to flag down the bartender to give is menus it all just went down hill ! the final insult was when we told him how incredibly salty and inedible the hamburger was he told us to tell them no extra salt on the tomatoes next time ! sorry won 't be a next time ! !
american	the staff was nice enough but the atmosphere is the most lifeless , soulless attempt at a 50 's diner . i got a bbq burger and to say it was average would set the bar low . it came with the most generic , tasteless fries i 've seen . to finish off my meal i got a vanilla custard with hot fudge , this was the only highlight , not great but not too bad either . with so many other better burger spots around the area at similar prices , you 'd have to be nuts to go here .
american	potato was too dry , hard and no taste . we pay overprice for hotel cafe because of their luxury service and ambience , and i don 't mind if i get great hospitality . but this was not i expect ... used to be so good ... what 's happen ? ? ? was it just our waiter ? or they conserve their budget ..
american	fire the chef . $ 24 for bad steak and eggs ? !
american	the other waiters were very helpful especially chris in getting us more coffee napkins and silverware . also we asked for bacon not sausage so they told us to give back the sausage off the plate that my husband had already eaten off of back to her . i hope they didn 't serve that to anyone else . i have never seen this before . i will never eat ate this denny 's again .
american	however , they have been gradually going downhill for the past two years to the point that i wouldn 't ever pay to eat here . i would only eat here when i could use myvegas rewards . if i had to pay for a buffet , i 'd much rather go to bellagio 's buffet which has now become my # 1 choice .
american	you are paying to eat at the bellagio . the food isn 't worth the price and after paying $ 50 plus gratuity i would have thought that i wouldn 't come away thinking that the best things i had were the pretzel roll and coffee . and i wouldn 't have thought that ordering espresso would incur add 'l cost . the buffets at m and paris are far better or if you leave the strip , the stations are a far better value .
american	the buffet and coffee shop and steakhouse all suck . the place is filthy and smells . it 's all garbage people that go there and there is no class there . that place is for white trash people and should be imploded .
american	it is a clean , bright space that is not crowded . this works well for those who are using aroma as their office . the food is unremarkable . the warm chicken salad had way too many diced tomato pieces and is simply not as good as a comparably priced salad at wendy 's . the salad came with a rather average-tasting piece of bread . i saw an in store ad for peach iced tea and added it . for 3 $ , there was no taste of peach , just an unsweetened iced tea . you can have a decent meal here , just not a particularly great one for the money .
american	wife and i proceed to buffet bar and it was 75 % empty i asked cook what was going he said in a a deamenrer : can 't you see we are switching from breakfast to lunch ! well excuse me ahole ! ! ! so i proceed to the front end where a 2 gentlemans where the i believe restaurant mgr and d other kitchen mgr . they stated we are transition from breakfast to lunch in a rude way . instead of the kitchen mgr standing around just talking you should get ur ass to the prep area and proceed with the transition as a team ... 1 and last time . sincerely , rich
american	sat here for 15 minutes , during which time a waitress walked by me and made eye contact with me before going back inside . no one acknowledged me and i left after sitting there for 20 minutes . on top of that i had called earlier in the day to make sure they would be open their usual hours since they often do special events . i was told they had normal hours all week . super good service , guys .
american	we were seated immediately though . no one even acknowledged our presence for 15 minutes . we got up and left , once again , without being acknowledged . disappointed .
american	not a lot of a staff manning the buffet . empty , picked over & veggies well past their prime ( brown broccoli ? ) . kids were licking their fingers and then grabbing serving utensils without parent or staff intervention . tub of sour cream with something in it that looked like cinnamon ? that was a definite pass . desert station looked like someone cleaned it out . you had to find staff to ask for baked goods . no cotton candy ? ? ? they claimed they were out . all it is is sugar , how can you be out ? the topper was the kids sticking their hands in the chocolate fountain . ugh .
american	the coffee was not that great either . the tab was $ 25.00 for two people for two omelets . i do not plan on returning !
american	we waited to be seated and was ignored by several staff . we waited 10 mins and then left . i used to love this place when i lived in montreal but today 's experience was terrible .
american	not busy at all . stood at hostess stand and was ignored for 5 minutes even though 4 different employees noticed me . that probably won 't affect anyone 's decision to come here or not but i 'm still gonna take this opportunity to say " f @ & k you " to this place .
american	got the pulled pork sandwich instead and it was the longest wait ever for something that is pretty much already made . really slow and it did not seem to be because they were busy . there were very few patrons . as i waited i could overhear others asking for the brisket and being told the sad news . the bad part was the employee watched them stare at the menu for many minutes without giving them the heads-up that they were out of brisket so back to the menu they went . pork was okay but not worth going back for . seems like a place that is a bit past it 's heyday .
american	seated right away and served quickly . my chicken barley soup was cold . corned beef was lean the way we like it . overall just an ok experience . the restaurant floor was dirty , table was sticky . $ 14.95 seems high for a sandwich with unremarkable rye bread and a pickle . corky and lenny 's a better value , has better menu selections and excellent hot soups .
american	my $ 12 " chopped salad " which was supposed to have cucumber , cherry tomato and red onion , was served with three tiny pieces of fish . not only was this nowhere near the menu description , this meal that should have been meatless and take zero time to prep , somehow took a whopping 45 minutes . this is one of the sorriest excuses for a restaurant that i 've seen in some time . definitely will be avoiding any sort of repeat here .
american	obviously from my omelet its more than a one person job . my omelet obviously stayed in the pan to long because the outside was overcooked and crusty . ate some of the middle and threw the rest away . not going back .
american	after 25 minutes we 're we 're 5th in line and told 7-8 minutes . after another 20 minutes were 4th in line and told 11 more minutes . i have an idea ... how about be honest with your customers and not try to hold them and waste their time . get your act together concord bonefish . : (
american	11 : 15 told food would be right out , 11 : 30 still no food . asked for manager and no manager ever came . got up and walked out at 11 : 37 . this place is ridiculous . save your time go to denny 's .
american	our three meals came out cold . two soups we were told had been pulled from the steam table a while before we came in . hash browns were just barely warm . the replacement food was not much better . we did not ask for the food to be comped but were offered that . my wife and i and daughter in law love bob evans and were starving when we came in . we left the restaurant hungry . we were not tough on the staff but we had the distinct impression that we were a bit of an inconvenience coming in an hour before closing .
american	i ordered a three-piece , the meat was dry and was not hot . the best thing about the meal was the cornbread which was hot . the restrooms are disgusting . i will not be back
american	waited 5 minutes just to reach the hostess stand to put our name in . they informed us of a 75-90 + min wait for a 2 top . half the tables were empty and there were more people standing around inside waiting than seated eating . sadly , we left . not worth that kind of wait for hit and miss reviews from our friends .
american	45 minutes later no food , no apology . terrible service .
american	so , we decided to order lunch . we waited for our food for 40 minutes ! waitress stated the delay was due to the health inspector being there . ( ? ? ) my chicken tenders and fries were good , but were cold . so , i ended up taking half of my food home . the lettuce in my garden salad seemed to have been frozen and then defrosted . my brother ordered a hamburger and mashed potatoes . food was cold , nothing special . i sure hope they take these reviews into consideration so that they can stay in business . place is beautiful , reminds me of camping . waitress was very friendly and attentive .
american	the sign on door says open at " 11am , " but there 's not a soul in sight . get it together monte . someone get out of bed and open up the pizzeria . based on the other reviews , it 's probably better that this place is closed right now .
american	my waiter didn 't come to my table until 11 : 25 . i ordered coffee , an omelette and hash browns . finally got my coffee at 11 : 35 after asking the waiter again . my omelette arrived at 11 : 55 , but without the hash browns . it 's now 12 : 20 ... still waiting on those hash browns . there are several open booths , so no reason for them to be overwhelmed . update : it 's 12 : 23 and the hash browns have arrived ! waiter was nice and apologetic , but i 'll still never come back .
american	it took 30 minutes for a salad and a french dip ( and they weren 't very busy ) . the fries were cold . the sandwich was cool . the au jus was hot enough to burn my lip , thereby rendering the whole thing inedible until it cooled . the ranch was so runny it was like water . and , to top it off , got a touch of food poisoning . won 't ever go back !
american	there is only one server working and the chef came out to help . still no refill on our water and no server to confirm food arrival . we just received food at 12 : 52am the food is cold and the pancakes were way smaller than usual . they usually are the size of the plate but that wasn 't the case this time . very disappointed
american	the place was pretty busy . it was so busy that we had a 15 minute wait . but it was weird that there were several tables that were open . after 10 minutes we were seated at a table that was available the entire time . person after person was told there was a 15-20 minute but tables were empty . i don 't quite understand . you push people away because you can 't hire a bus boy ? or your kitchen is backed up ? hire more people ! you 're obviously busy and making money .
american	she returned 5 minutes later with wine and water we never did see the bread . there were only 4 tables in restaurant and 2 servers so you would think service would be excellent ...... well 40 minutes later she brings the salads to our table and then 4 minutes after that the main entrée , so we didn 't have time to eat our salad , food was good and when we finally got the bread it was not fresh at all . this is the second time we have had this experience at this restaurant and it will be the last . this place needs some new management .
american	my husband and i showed up and all i wanted was a brewed coffee . by the time someone decided to come to the counter it was 3 : 54 and they told us that they would have to brew fresh coffee , which takes 7 minutes and unfortunately they close at 4 . really disappointed in the lack of customer service- not to mention it was an extremely easy order .
american	debit card wasn 't accepted so went off looking for an atm . arrived back at 4 : 05 am only to hear that they suddenly changed available menus to ' breakfast only ' . personnel couldn 't do anything without manager . instead , he recommended us a place nearby that was able to sell us hamburgers . a mcdonalds that can 't sell hamburgers to customers ? unheard of . not visiting ever again .
american	stood by the " wait to be seated sign " for about 5 minutes and no one ever addressed us . we ended up walking out ! horrible customer service !
american	why would a pizzeria do this ? ! it wouldn 't have been so bad if the host hadn 't spoken to me so condescendingly . bummer , will update my rating if i ever give this place another try .
american	ordered ice tea not fit for consumption . appetizer came after 30 min and thin crust pizza about 15 min later . while we were there 3 couple left without being served.the waitress had an argument with the greeter about seating more people in her area pretty sure her area was the whole place . didn 't like the pizza either . save yourself the grief just go to monicals
american	could count 6 patrons total in the entire restaurant . waited 30 minutes to be greeted at our table . never received the drinks we ordered . 1 server in the entire restaurant . when our food arrived , it was burnt to a crisp . what a mess .
american	after 50 minutes a group of 5 " neighborhood " people came in and were seated in a corner table ahead of us ! horrible service and no regard for customers that are not wearing skinny jeans . i don 't care how good the food is , i will never return !
american	no host , no one to greet , .... waited more than 10 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge our presence at the restaurant . walked to bar etc and nothing . no one tending bar . bare staff . manager person named mark eventually walks up to us and says he was busy . restaurant may have had 3-5 parties . not busy . if my family hadn 't insisted we go here , we would have walked out . for years i have seen that this sight charges a lot for poor service . i did not eat there and never will again . i believe in people putting in hard work for their station . this restaurant should close .
american	got seated at 7 : 30 , put order in shortly thereafter . we got bread and our soups fairly quickly then sat for an hour without any signs of food . we looked around the restraint and it was obvious other tables had been waiting and we 're getting frustrated . the waitress apologized the kitchen was slow , so we gave it another 15 minutes before we finally walked out at 9 : 15 still hungry . the food i saw looked good , but i would never recommend this place . it doesn 't take over an hour and a half to make a friggin salad and pasta .
american	well fat chance of getting a mimosa or any alcoholic beverage . they serve alcohol after 12 noon . our waiter was rude about it after i said that 's all i really wanted for breakfast . we went ahead and ordered breakfast . i got the classic breakfast with 2 eggs your way . i asked to have them poached , the waitress laughed ..... and said either fried or scrambled . why advertise your way if it 's only prepared two ways . my husband got the large breakfast which was just like mine except they put 4 tbs of grits under his eggs , oh did i mention they only serve cold white un _ toasted toast
american	service was friendly and quick . my omelet was lack luster and lacked flavor . potatoes were really undercooked and omelet was over cooked . i thought there were green chilies in the potatoes but it was just undercooked potatoe soaked in oil . the wife enjoyed her food but there are defiantly better places around town .
american	the restsurant had steady traffic but everything we ordered was returned . chicken nuggests were cold and chewy and were ether over-cooked ir re-cooked . i ordered two burgers . the first , a double cheeseburger was cold , burnt and the buns were stale . i tried my luck on a second sandwitch--a quarter pounder with cheese and had the same experience . we brought everything to the counter told the manager it was unedible and left .
american	walked in with party of 4 to an fairly empty dining room . tables clean and ready for seating . were told that it would be 20 to 30 minute wait . because they were anticipating some large groups due to graduation . another family said they had been there for close to an hour waiting to be seated . we all left to give some other business our money . this is not how to treat customers . will not be back .
american	i had always avoided joes but it was the only place open so we gave it a chance . slow service mediocre to lousy food . need i say more ? will not be back .
american	requested to sit at the window seats but was refused because they were all reserved ( they were almost all empty until we left ) . ordered a median rare steak , but it was served very rare . fortunately the waiter was nice to bring it back to recook . the sauce on the steak tasted too sour , personally i didn 't like it .
american	service was prompt , but we were given a table illuminated by the headlights of every car pulling in . drinks and appetizer ( beef carpaccio ) were fantastic , but the entrees were extremely salty . my wife 's seafood was inedible , they remade it supposedly without any salt , and it was still inedibly salty . my pork was equally salty , but at least was served with cabbage and apples . for the amount spent on this meal , the food quality was utterly unacceptable . i give it two stars only because the appetizer was truly wonderful and work the cost .
american	noticed this arby 's across the street . it was 10 : 30p so i checked the website to see if they were still open and the site said they were open until midnight . i walked over and found only the drive thru was open . i called to ask if i could order a to go through the drive thru , they said no . i asked if i could pay cash for a to go order at the door and they said no . i asked if there was anything i could do and they said try back tomorrow .
american	the cafe was open and completely empty . i asked if i could sit for the 9 minutes until the store opened . was told that the cafe is not associated with the store and i would have to buy something . wrong answer . the correct answer from one human to another in this context is : " yes . absolutely . make yourself comfortable . " a smarter person continues with : " would you like something to eat while you wait ? bagel ? glass of juice ? " she was obviously not that smart . she chose the other route and went back to checking her phone .
american	overall the service and food were terrible , extremely long wait for our order to be taken , coffee refills and when the food arrived it was cold . after i brought this to the waitresses attention she made excuse after excuse and ultimately brought over one plate of breakfast potatoes for the table to share . completely unacceptable ... not worth the money you 'll spend . you 'll be better off someplace else also no turkey sausage , only pork friendly breakfast meat options
american	once seated we waited around for 15 minutes before we had to ask to see a waiter to place our order . not even a quick visit to take drink orders . after ordering it took about 45 minutes to get 2 classic breakfasts and 1 shakshuka . overall the food was good however the service spoiled the whole event . to add insult to injury we were charged for refills of coffee ( standard filter coffee ) . do not recommend on a weekend for brunch .
american	left at 12 : 50 without ever receiving our food or an apology . enough said ...
american	that put a dent in the mood for the entire visit . 30 minutes after ordering , we were informed that there were no english muffins available for the eggs benedict . at opening . for brunch . my toast came out cold and the coffee was terrible . the home fries were excellent , and the mimosas were tasty . the place was completely empty the whole time , except for one other customer . overall , not a very inviting or enjoyable atmosphere , in spite of the lovely , dark decor of the restaurant .
american	why in the world do you have customers wait ... most silliest thing i have every experienced . food - had burger with mac and cheese , french dip , 68 cajun sandwich and caesar salad . food was good and no complaints . reason for the one star is the horrible hostess staff ... they should all be replaced immediately ! they were not engaging or excited to be working and it seemed like it was a chore to seat people . just one example is that they seated a gentlemen who was in a wheelchair at a high top that has no support for him . thank god some patrons at the bar saw that and switched out chairs so he had a back support .
american	finally our salads arrived with medium cool lettuce and the chicken on top was like ice ( it was grilled chicken ) so .... we walked out after one bite ... not exactly a dine-n-dash ... wouldn 't recommend this one ! ! !
american	served half of our group . we finally received out food at 10 : 44 , with incorrect orders . the food is average and waitstaff is attentive to your drinks but not much else .
american	my visit was ok , then again , i don 't expect much from these greasy spoons anyways . i ordered the bacon cheeseburger with a large set of regular fries for myself & 2 others . the burger was good , but lacked a bit of flavour in the beef patties . the bacon helped a bit flavour wise . the fries were a little over cooked when i got them . the only issues i 've came across there was , the music was too loud & the table i sat at was too wobbly . & just a tip to anyone reading this , the food is over priced , expect to shell out more if you decide to buy anything .
american	was told to go " sit " at a booth ; that menus were on the table . searched for a clean table even though the restaurant was nearly empty and had multiple waiters sitting around including the person at the register . other than my waitperson , the rest of staff looked at me as if i were from mars , not evening smiling in my direction . if your looking for food , go . if your looking for good service , go somewhere else .
american	* arrived before the dinner rush * nine occupied tables in restaurant with four servers * took forever to get our food * server too busy talking to refill drinks * as soon as food comes out , server asks if we want dessert * i said i 'd like to eat my meal prior to ordering dessert * server asks me to pay on kiosk while i 'm still eating * can i finish my meal though ?
american	after being seated had another long wait for orders to be taken . food took more than 40mins and arrived lukewarm and slightly burnt . had to flag down waitress repeatedly for coffee , cream & sugar , butter , & napkins . the place is cavernous and the noise level is overwhelming . save your time and money , snooze is highly over-rated . the service is minimal and the food is mediocre at best .
american	seated with no problem . drink order was taken . 10 minutes later the waitress returned and said she forgot what we wanted . gave it again and then ordered food . dishes were served not as ordered , items forgotten . the potatoes were cold and tasted like they were made last week .. when bill arrived it was all wrong . the place was overcrowded and so noisy that you had to shout to be heard across the table . it was a real zoo . last time at this place . poor service and mediocre food .
american	also food was bad . games cost way too much . ( 2.00 for one game of air hocky ! ! ! ) so crowded you can barely move . also wtf with the reserved seating in the dining room ? apparently they will reserve empty tables all day so no one else can sit to eat . so if you go for the crappy food , good luck trying to find a place to sit and eat it ! ! !
american	waiting for staff to show up to their job ! one waitress asked us to to serve our own ice water and iced tea from the waitress station ! location now closed !
american	at 10 : 30 could only get breakfasts . good just average . atmosphere was fast foodie . coffee was good , but could only get 1 cup . would of liked another .
american	the restaurant was not excessively busy . we ordered a salad and bbq chicken pizza . it took over 45 minutes to get our food and that was after 30 minutes when we asked our server shawn the status of our order . while filling glasses of water for some ladies at an adjacent table , he completely ignored us and the fact that our water was empty while we were waiting . the food was okay but not worth over $ 35.00 plus the wait . watching the server , it appeared he did not want to be there . i don 't recommend this restaurant .
american	arrived for my lunch break at 2 : 00 was sat immediately , no waitress for 10mins we ask bus boy to find one , was advised one is on the way , waited additional 10mins then left , on the way out advised manager or whomever sat us that we 're leaving because no waitress came , by he didn 't seem too concerned
american	music was at a very loud and uncomfortable level . the place was full so we sat at the bar . i had to fight for space with a waiter who was using the spot beside me to fill little cups with maple syrup . the pancakes were pretty blah . they were dense and very dry . both the regular buttermilk and their " black and blue " pancakes were not good . we also got a side of breakfast sausages and they weren 't very good . more of a dinner sausage than a breakfast sausage . ... and it was pretty pricey for such lackluster food . we were quite disappointed .
american	waiting over an hour for apetizers . tables getting up and leaving . i asked politely to speak with the manager who came out and said hes sorry but doesnt know what the fuck hes doing . complete door knob . im done with kelseys for ever . ordered bread and wings . how hard is it to deep fry some wings and warm up bread ? its 7 : 10 and still waiting . wtf ! this is now a complete joke . ive never seen anything like this before . cara should look into this place and close it down . they completely ruin the brand . do not go to kelseys . terrible service !
american	so i asked for belvedere and they were out of that too . geez , vegas on a friday night and they can 't keep the bar stocked ! disappointed . menu selection much more limited than shown on yelp .
american	everyone was wearing thier coats . we were seated promtly and offered menu . i asked waitress if heat was not working she said they would turn up heat . menu was limited and no mardi gras specials . drink order was taken and our food order as well . food arrived promptly but my etufee was cold to the taste . waitress took it back and had it warmed up . my wife 's food was somewhat hot wich leads me to believe that they don 't have it hot and ready to serve . was not satisfied with it in the least and will not be returning .
american	arrived ... had to wait 30 min for a drink .... then another 30 for our food ... servers were nice enough and the food was pretty good .... over the last 6 months that i have been going there this is the pattern ..... order then wait ... wait .... wait
american	my father in law and hubby ate here on lunch times when their offices were near by . fresh asphalt met us and they were not apparently open ! ! ! so sad ! phone # message did not indicate taylor 's would be closed ! am here for only a few days soooo sad .
american	while the people and service were friendly that is where everything positive to say ends . foods was just awful . now i have to say this was the scaled down menu in the lounge area but that really isn 't an excuse . lobster bites and ricotta dishes were awful ! i wish i had something more positive to say ... guess the only positive is i know i won 't be back ?
american	arrived in vegas late & check-in at this hotel took for ever ... we were starving an popped in here for a bite to eat before hitting the town ... the wait to be seated was quick and the service was ok , the food was ok , nothing to rave about and nothing that made us want to pop back in while staying here ... so all in all ... try some where else unless you just need nourishment quickly
american	we ordered a bottle of wine that took 12 minutes . then we asked for appetizers that was another 20 minutes . we were out of wine and not a server in site . appetizers arrived , everything was cold . not a server around . we were taking clients out that are worth more then three million . dinner was ordered .. my ribeye ordered med rare was well done , ny strip med rare was so tough . my next steak came back well done , chewy and so tough , couldn 't eat it . poor service , poor food quality , poor everything . would never recommend this restaurant . gm @ restaurant in chicago . this restaurant failed miserably .
american	quickly realized that the wait staff was not happy to see us . we grabbed a bar table and waited about ten minutes until someone finally walked by and threw menus on the table . the rest of the experience pretty much followed suit . they need some better help .
american	girl finally took our order and returned 26 min later with our food . 3 hotdogs 2 drinks . brings new heights to fast food . avoidthis place at all costs .
american	service asked that i remove my hat . which i respectfully did so , we felt as if we were treated as 3rd class citizens . if you have a dress code advise so when a group walks in to the hostess area . ordered spaghetti and meatballs . pasta was cooked well , but was disappointed with the meatballs . sauce was very bland . overall we were in and out in less than 30 min . my vp highly recommend this place since we were new to the area . very disappointed and a little irritated with service . needless to say even thought the location is minutes from our house we will not be returning .
american	did not have chocolate milk available for kids . husband got the croque madame - huge portion , he said it was ok . i got the pecan pie pancakes - large portion , but basically pancakes with some pecans on them - way oversold the description . kids got pancakes and waffle - basic . seating for 10-15 tables , in addition to some bar seating - line was out the door by the time we left - not real sure why . was a disappointing visit .
american	was seated quickly and placed our order by 12 : 20 . ordered a caesar salad and shrimp appetizer . it wasn 't crowded at all , maybe 10 cars in the parking lot . waitress brought us bread 2 times , still no food at 1 : 00pm , so we just left . 40 minutes of waiting , waitress never came over and said they she was sorry it was taking so long , nothing . next time we 'll try longhorn !
american	stood around for 10 minutes , since the sign says wait to be seated by staff , we were never even acknowledged by the staff or told what the wait looked like not a good start at all . good enough for 1 star . left without eating .
american	as i went to the counter and told them i 'll just take my $ back ; ( i had to go ) i asked for the manager in which they replied , " he wasn 't there . " i later called to complain about the service but was hung-up on twice . when i called bk the 3rd time , a representative yelled a profanity at me and hung up on me again . all this over breakfast ? ! it 's not that serious but don 't appreciate being disrespected , cussed at because no one wanted to take responsibility and talk to a dissatisfied customer . i 'll never return there and will advise others not to do so as well .
american	waited 5min for someone to show up and asked the hostess if i could order to go . she said " yes sure , just order at the bar . " i then sat at the bar and waited 20min . there was only one bartender for 13 people and he never came to see me . i then left and told the hostess who didn 't give a s ... the worst tgif i 've ever seen in my life , i hope this location goes out of business , they don 't deserve to get customers .
american	but seconds after being seated noticed 2 dead bugs on our table . waitress laughed and made a joke of it . not amused . food was good . not fantastic but not bad either . was slow to come out and with a few errors but they did correct them . i would return for the sliders .
american	when i stated i made it with mckenzie i was told they have multiple people named mckenzie . finally hostess found my reservation . food was ordered after a lengthy weight at the table . order arrived 30 minutes after placing it . food was mediocre . green beans were ice cold .. bbq didn 't taste authentic . won 't go back .
american	seated and found service to be extraordinarily weak . no water , but another waitress alerted us twice that our server will be with " shortly . " it wasn 't busy , but their computer input looked like a great place to hang out . food was average and pricey with their signature smoke and pepper burger priced at $ 13.99 . no thanks . unlimited fries were served in a strange metal collar and were greasy and lukewarm . awful experience . save your $ 30 and go to in-n-out as fast as possible .
american	the place was empty but seemed trendy . we were immediately seated outside where we waited for 10 minutes before placed our drink orders . the water . brought out 6 waters but never returned . we waited another 15 minutes for our drinks , which never showed up . so we left . we did go in to inform the hostess that we were leaving , and she said " okay ! " i will not return .
american	two waitresses independently ' cared ' for our table making it impossible to know whether a request was being followed up or not - because requests took a long time to prompt any action . the restaurant was hardly crowded , yet we still waited nearly 40 minutes for our food to arrive - which ended up being cold , undercooked or plain just not what was ordered . the food was low quality ( e.g. raspberries drowning in sauce / syrup straight from a jar ) and often near tasteless . unfortunately gratuity is included for a group our size , because the experience definitely didn 't warrant it .
american	was told that the wait was less than an hour if we prepaid . so we did . over a thousand bucks . it took over two frkn hours to get a table . idiots run this place . fire the host staff . very unprofessional behavior . while eating , we old retired wealthy farts decided to not gamble one penny at caesars . we spent the last four days of our trip in other casinos . fire the idiots in charge of this buffet , they are losing you big bucks in the casino .
american	however , it took over 40 mins to get our food . when it came , it was cold . subpar bbq joint with slow service . would not eat again .
american	arrive restaurant about 1030 for breakfast the host have sit us in five min service was so bad we have wait about half hours n none server was greeted us or knowledge us to let us know be right with us then we just left
american	" in an area where literally right next store is another restaurant , turning away business seems odd ( especially only being open a short time ) . additionally , we utilized the no wait app prior to arriving which gave us an estimated time of 7-14 minutes for seating , to then find out it would be 30 + minutes . as a restaurant , i would feel like your customers shouldn 't be effected by whatever is happening in the kitchen . we subsequently took our business to the restaurant next store , which had no problem seating us immediately . disappointing first experience .
american	not one compelling menu item . intelligencia sort of atmosphere , that was not appealing to me . very comfortable patio chairs ... great view for watching people ... but if you are craving dinner , walk 100 steps to another kierland establishment . i will never darken their door again . very french in their attitude .... if you know what i mean .
american	arrogant cleveland heights cuisine hits a new low with a ridiculously high price for very little food or creativity .
american	went for burger , was told $ 3 extra for any cheese other than american . $ 20 burger came out after 40 min with cheddar and no bacon as ordered . waited another 30 min and burger came out overcooked with bacon but no fries . manager tried to argue fries did not come with meal . if you come for view and to people watch , good choice . for any food related activity , there are many other better choices .
american	otherwise i dont think ill be going back . $ 7 for a lil ceasar which is just some iceberg lettuces a tiny bit of cheese and 3 croutons . that along with the wait- not worth it for me . thanks for the group on cause for 2 apps and two small salads it would have been $ 60 otherwise .
american	other options seemed unappealing . disappointing with ice rain and not wanting to go out
american	greens had soaked in dressing too long , almost at wilt stage . beets should have been sliced smaller . ginger carrot juice was good though , light and refreshing .
american	legendary burger was not very memorable . average american junk food spot . the patio area is nice and shaded and you can people watch from certain seats . staff was super friendly and attentive .
american	they don 't really do anything especially well . also , i 've had inconsistent quality of food and helpfulness of staff on different occasions . i can 't slam this place for one unpleasant waitress , but i can for those inconsistencies and that fact that there are just so many other places that do what they do better . in fact , this place was the very last denny 's i ever ate . the food took forever , it wasn 't well done , came out all screwed up , and the waitress was unpleasant . after that experience i decided to never set foot in another denny 's .
american	friendly staff from before are all gone , service is horrible , staff seem to disappear with a promise to return , if you can afford to wait . biggest surprise ... no hash browns for breakfast ! how can a breakfast and brunch place not have hash browns ? yes , they have some potatoes but it isn 't the same .
american	at first it looked inviting , service was friendly and quick . however , the ventilation is not great and there is a haze of smoke that permeates everything . we ordered the spicy omelette and the spicy frittata , with the latter having only egg whites . both arrived with very large chunks of tomatoes and jalepeno peppers which made the egg dishes wet and unappetizing . on the positive side , the portions were generous and the coffee was decent .
american	this is a brand new location and we spent most of our dinner trying to kill fruit flies . jumbo shrimp as a meal were small , ( not jumbo ) and alcoholic drinks were not good . the last one , i actually sent back . lastly , the service wasn 't bad , just non-existent . very disappointed in this location as i know bonefish have been good in the past . avoid this location for something better , really anything else .
american	living in chicago for over 15 years i can tell you it 's a huge sports town . matt 's chicago dogs does not have a single trace of any bears , bulls , blackhawks , cubs , white sox , or fire anywhere . no street signs or any atmosphere . not even sure there was a photograph of the windy city to be found . the food was mediocre at best compared to portillo 's . food goes down better when stoned
american	the sodexo at my office have the same breakfast everyday , same dry biscuits , brittle bacon l and yellow eggs , an entire energy drink wall and candy stand . the prices are unfavorable . i 'd rather be hungry .
american	i remember them being so large and crammed with tons of fixins . not anymore ! in fact , i took one bite and might as well have bit into a salt rock . i gave the rest to the dog . it was so unbelievably aweful . all i wanted was a taste of my childhood and what i got was a mouth full of artificial sodium . does that mean my childhood was salty ( grrr ! ) or bloated ( bloated - ugh ! ) ... i guess one might say not to place childhood emphasis on a burger .
american	well not this location ! they just opened a few months ago , but need better staff . i understand you 're busy , but waitstaff should help each other out . went here for a weekend breakfast- waiter never came back to check on us until we were done eating . all of our drinks were empty and even though other staff walked by with water pitchers , they don 't stop to check on other customers- only their own tables . food was greasy and tasteless with presentation lacking . this is just a bad village inn . decor is nice , but management needs to train employees !
american	was intending to dine here , but after no follow-up visit from our waitress , we left . i 'm guessing regulars get better treatment
american	substandard cocktails mixed with inexperienced ( unprofessional ) service makes for a experience best not had . downtown madison is not that much further away . don 't bother stopping here .
american	friends who 've come with me order a variety of things and while the consensus was that the food was good , it wasn 't out of this world and not really any better than other breakfast joints around . go to the curve if you want a killer omelet . go just about anywhere else for more bang for your buck .
american	the red beans and rice tasted like like it was old . the blackened catfish looked like it was beat up and it tasted like it too . the food was just bad . service is pretty terrible too . this restaurant is not a serious place .
american	unfortunately the food is not as good . most of us ordered burgers . that seemed like a great idea since they had so many options . unfortunately the burgers are not good . thankfully i ordered the whole wheat bun . it was just fine . everyone else went with the standard bun which was hard as a rock . the toppings were great but the burger its self was bland and simple . there are a lot of televisions. so it is probably a good place to catch the game with friends . i would just eat before you get there .
american	while i 've never been a fan of the joe 's crab shack chain , my company insisted that we stop and give it another try . we came on a wednesday it happened to be " all you can eat shrimp " now , while being leery i ordered a round ... of course there was a long black shiny hair on one of my crispy shrimp . i informed my server , she then informed the manager . the manager reluctantly apologized and offered us another round of shrimp as opposed to asking us how we would like to be compensated . thanks but no thanks never again .
american	i ordered the gourmet veggie sandwich . the bread was great . the insides were anything but gourmet . the gal making the sandwich was very frugal when putting veggies on my sandwich . plus they were not as fresh as i would have liked . and the avocado spread , i thought she had forgot to put it on , but i did find a faint trace of spread in between the cheese slices . will not visit this jimmy john 's again .
american	while he didn 't provide much in the way of explanation as to why this occurred ( other than saying that sunday brunch is their busiest service ) , he was very polite and offered to see that any future reservation would be overseen by him . i am still a bit miffed from the initial interaction , but will more than likely give them another try . i have been there many times for " i got 5 on it , " their 90 's hip hop night and it is quite the blast . i look forward to speaking with robert personally next time i attend . hopefully the results will be better this time .
american	instead i had a horrible experience starting with my server who didn 't know anything about the menu and then gave me an attitude when i ask if i can alter my order as i am allergic to certain foods . then i had the chicken sandwich and it was horrible . if you are looking for something good and fast to eat , cross the street to gretzky .
american	i can tell the fucking different between fresh and reheated tots get your shit together
american	granted , they do have long lines that are taken care of as best as possible . i don 't come here too often , but 2 times ago i had a hair wrapped in my dd , last time i had a ton of fry chips that made up about half of my fry boat & this time i only ordered a cheeseburger animal t p whgr instead & received a cheeseburger wo after waiting about 20 min in line . also , the tables are always dirty when we eat inside . maybe i 've had bad luck , but seven years as an employee & visiting just about every store in town makes me think otherwise sometimes .
american	people who state they have the best burgers in town have never had a good burger . good burgers are not dry and hard like a hockey puck , and great burgers can be cooked to order . cooking below medium-well is against the law here , but the cooks at the penguin do not need to press every bit of juice out that they can . the fried pickles are too salty -- meaning pickles are salty enough on their own , so the batter and dressing should have no salt or at least low salt . almost all food is luke-warm . i have eaten there numerous times with people who insisted i just hit the place at the wrong time . they were wrong .
american	we felt the $ 43 a pop price was pretty high , but we were treating family . we got there and it was pretty full , and looked pretty trendy , and overrated . now for the food . the presentation was okay , but the taste was horrible to okay on a lot of the entree items . the ice crab was salty , and the hot crab did not taste that fresh . there lobster was not lobster at all , and to add insult to injury my husband and i both got sick shortly after our trip here . if i wanted montezumas revenge i would have drank the tap water in mexico . thanks for the biggest ripoff in las vegas .
american	this past saturday , i attended post badger game for the dane 's $ 2 drafts . i started to get hungry and ordered the cheese / artichoke dip . it was absolutely terrible , the bread bowl it came out in was cold hard bread and the dip might as well been cream of chicken soup with large chunks of artichoke . not much of a dip . for $ 10 , i expected much better than the top of the bread bowl ( which was also hard and cold ) and a few sticks of celery / carrots . no one at my table would even try it , it looked so unappetizing and i couldn 't blame them .
american	last night i brought my family from out of town expecting a wonderful meal . unfortunately extremely dissappointed . i had the tenderloin with blue cheese risotto , the meat was tough and dry the risotto had no flavor . my daughter pointed out a bug flying by , the waiter only came to our table once after we were served , daughter had mexiloaf , not good again meat dry . i was really embarassed by the whole experience . will sadly have to scratch this place off list to take out of town guest ..
american	the only thing i appreciated was the urgency the night manager took in trying to rectify the incorrect meals ( to include food ordered not arriving ) . unfortunately at the point when you have to speak with a manager the evening is ruined and appetites are gone . to 30 mins before first drinks , house salads coming after the meals after repeated request , incorrect appetizer and plate comes out with no ribs and a burnt steak . for a birthday dinner at a well established restaurant we regret this decision .
american	the service was alright and there was nothing spectacular about the food . the coffee was good and the pies were of a normal magnitude . the food was that of a cafeteria at a hospital . if you can eat elsewhere , please do .
american	but for some reason the new one mint hill cannot get an order right to save their life . i 've been this particular zaxby 's three times and all three times they have gotten my order incorrect . each time i 've called back and the manager has replace my order but i should not have to do that , it seems that the front counter people and drive-through people could care less about customer service . the last time i placed an order the manager got mine replacement incorrect ! ! ! whenever i feel like i want zaxbys please i 'll have to use another location , as the one in mint hill seems completely uninterested in getting my order right .
american	bloody mary 's were the worst i 've had in charlotte . meh !
american	the lamb chops were overcooked and overpriced . there calamari leaves much to be desired . there are much better greek restaurants in montreal , elounda and mythos come to mind . but if you must stay in the west island and want to eat greek , la porte grecque offers a decent greek fare .
american	i should hold have left immediately as the place smelled like a grease pit . and so did the sandwiches . one bite from each was all we could handle . walked out and deposited them in the trash can at the end of acorn alley . never again . i would have given it no stars if i could .
american	the 3 in my part had very diverse orders , being tilapia , a buget and a quesadiilla , all having one thing in common . ... they we all absolutely terrible . overcooked and undersized burger , drenched in butter and bland tilapia and boring quesadiilla . the service was terrible and unintelligent . do not eat here . the only redeeming quality for this establishment was location .
american	upon leaving the restaurant my umbrella was nowhere to be found . the manager on duty offered to replace my umbrella . i sent him all the information upon returning to the usa and have also written them concerning this matter . apparently they word is not worth anything . beware , if you allow your belongings to be checked by the greeter .
american	everything is wrong . the fries , the gravy and the cheese are simply wrong . you would think that it would be easy to get those 3 simple ingredients right but it 's not . if you 're truly a fan of authentic poutine , this doesn 't even begin to be anything close to the real thing .
american	" not very good for what you end up paying . skimpy on the meat and the tzatziki sauce was bland . menu board is not what you pay because they charge extra for things that should come standard on a gyro .
american	so far i 've tried it four times , and won 't be returning . the food is over priced , and prepared blandly . the veggie burger was originally made in house , but now has been replaced by a frozen mass produced patty . added an extra star for the nice decor and nice ( but slow ) staff .
american	service was slow and inattentive . kitchen staff appeared to spend more time sitting around talking that cooking . the waffles were soggy and unappetizing . they looked like they were pre-made and had been sitting under a warmer . the syrup they gave me was fake . really fake . the chicken was the worst part . it was greasy , overcooked , and the furthest thing from friend chicken i 've ever encountered . according to the other reviewers , this location gives the brand a bad name . if i 'm ever in arizona or near another one , maybe i 'll give it another shot .
american	unfortunately , it let me down . to start , we had reservations for 6 : 45 and the host couldn 't find my name . he eventually found it and said that someone else took it ? ? ? for that reason , it took them over 20 minutes to seats us .... with a reservation ..... once we got to our table , our waiter was super rushed and frazzled and listed at least 5 items that they were out of . weird ! i ended up getting the new york strip and it wasn 't special at all , especially for the price . not planning on returning . this place is too busy and can 't keep up with itself .
american	the service , seeing as how there wasn 't many people there ( wonder why ) , was slow . the credit card machine in my parking spot was broken . when i told the car hop she did not really seem to care . once i got back home , which was across the street , my food was cold and very sloppily put together . i had a chili dog . nothing crazy . the staple of sonic drive ins . by reading the other reviews , poor decision hindsight , this place is in desperate need of some new management .
american	it consisted of two leaves of romaine lettuce , with a few beans , a few chunks of ham fat , and other assorted small things scattered about . in a pool of about a teaspoon of pesto . very pretty dish . not much to eat though . and pretty tasteless . the main was so unimpressive i can 't even remember what it was a week later . but i do remember it was expensive . i could have had a good steak for that price .
american	" dolly " from the philippines is one of the rudest people i have met in my life , even after showing her my member card . if it wasn 't for the others in my party being so hungry we would have been out of here . i will update my review after dinner but i am shocked that people of that lack any people skills whatsoever work in a service industry . the server and other hostess were fantastic . i am really disappointed with the claim jumper chain . it 's the black sheep of the landry company .
american	we ordered three of the specialty " the wicked " sandwiches . expecting a quality sandwich , we didn 't get what we expected . the service was pretty slow for a chain . only 4 people staffed and 3 people in the sandwich line ( during a busy after waiting nearly 10 minutes for our sandwiches . when we spoke up and asked where the bacon was , they gave us 3 measly strips of bacon among three 10 " sandwiches . and offered no apologies . i don 't think the staff knows how to make sandwiches . i truly understand the meaning of " which wich " ? ! ?
american	so greatly overrated . it took 2 hours to eat some really average , overpriced food ... some of which we didn 't even eat . i have no problem paying $ 150-200 for a good meal for two , but when leaving this place , we just felt like suckers . go off the strip or to an up-and-coming chef 's restaurant , they might pay more attention to their food quality .
american	personally , i don 't find the burgers or fries here as extraordinary or even special ; shake shack , fatburger , and a zillion other places in vegas , deliver a better product . everytime i drive by here , and see the parking lot jammed , i find myself at a total loss of understanding , or an appreciation of someone 's successful merchandising . this place does not " deserve " the patronage it gets ...
american	but for all the other things the restaurant is trying to be i would not recommend it . casino prices and underwhelming food , with average service . expensive wine list and everything a la carte , even though they call it casual dining , make for a disappointing experience . kind of like losing at the craps table . we tried 5 different dishes from veal , chicken , fish and pizza and the pizza was the only memorable , authentic dish .
american	pop 's gets points for using philly amoroso 's rolls and offering cheez whiz , but misses the mark with the meat . the texture of the meat is totally off . paid about 8 dollars more than the same order in philly . close , but doesn 't quite make the mark .
american	from the moment i walked in the door , the kid that greated us looked like he didn 't want to be there . he was also on his phone . the food is terrible . bacon looks fake , eggs looks like the kind from mcdonalds . dont understand why people go to this place . and our wait for a simple breakfast was unacceptable . i rarely write reviews but people shouldn 't waist there money here . go to wagon wheel down the street . thats a real breakfast and costs less !
american	fast , commercial food quality at best ! unfortunately , i had a patty melt that caused me to be sick all night long with nausea . one member of the party ordered a well done burger . it was not well done it was completely burnt . not even a hungry dog would eat this burger . unprofessional staff , untrained staff and sleeping management . i 'm amazed how many reviews are positive for this establishment . does not deserve one star but could not post a review without it . never again !
american	a talented chef designs the menu and recipes . 2 . the restaurant serves amazing food for a short time . 3 . accountants find ways to cut cost . 4 . the food goes downhill . sadly , such is the way with holstein 's . the first time i ate here the burgers knocked my socks off . the second time , i wished i had just gone to applebee 's . it 's easier to park at applebee 's , the food comes out faster , it 's cheaper , and the food is better ! the saddest part : the resort restaurants keep getting away with this . that is all i have to say .
asian	always perfect for that mot too big meal and the prices are on point .. watching the cooks do their thing is always a highlight for me ..
asian	good portions of fish in rolls . unlike ra !
asian	and i never have to wait long ! i had my first taro smoothie here and am hooked ! i 'm so glad the staff recommended it . thank you ! will most definitely be back
asian	they made a mistake and had to wait 5 minutes more but no big deal . they aplogize couple of times . great customer service and food is always made fresh because they make you wait . my kids love their food .
asian	their meat doesn 't have a lot of fat in it . the guy at cash gave me a good deal for my money , which i appreciated . the student special is a good deal . my personal favourite is the lazeez on the sticks . one thing i like though is that with the number of franchises opening up . they are able to maintain the food quality and service . serving size is pretty decent for the price they charge .
asian	i 've probably ordered most of the menu by now and never been disappointed . you know it 's good when you ask someone from hawaii where to get good hawaiian food and they suggest island flavor !
asian	i can 't complain about this place and they are friendly when you go inside . i have ordered many time from here now and have never had a bad experience .
asian	yellow curry and red curry are the best here !
asian	the honey walnut prawns are huge and perfectly battered . the general 's chicken was very popular at our table . the hk chow mein is delicious . five spice calamari to die for . everything on the menu is great . the service is wonderful and friendly . the food is always cooked perfectly . this is a great place for high quality authentic chinese food and it has a great ambiance . wonderful for lunch or dinner .
asian	service is efficient and pleasant volcano beef and orange chicken are super yummy . we love yans ! !
asian	lots of options on the food and drink menu with varying levels of spice . i like to get the panang curry here , but also enjoy the drunken noodles and the pad thai . the sticky rice with mango is a slammin dessert option ... atmosphere is energetic regardless of what time you go in .
asian	great quality meat selection . excellent lunch specials of two or three items . sakura fest deals offer even more specials on top of their happy hour deals . the rewards program is great and offers free items when enough points are earned . wait staff is nice and attentive . great spot for groups and special occasions .
asian	sushi is always fresh and hibachi is made with love . whether dining in or take out i 'm always pleased . love the location . parking on a friday or saturday night is a little tricky so come early ! !
asian	same delivery people who are usually very friendly ! great food
asian	always quick to serve good , tasting affordable lunches !
asian	food is always fresh and hot . they just started charging for tea $ 2.00pp .... that was surprising . they also charge if you want another bowl of white rice and there is an upcharge for brown rice . their food is good - always fresh and hot whenever it comes to the table . they have new menus - maybe that 's why they started adding these extra charges . one dish is enough for two people to share and be full . everything we 've ordered was delicious .
asian	pork bone soup is definitely the fan favourite and it is very tasty , the broth is flavourful . they also have quite a few other food items that i have yet to try . it 's 24 / 7 so i come here whenever i have the munchies or am just looking for a late night meal with friends . they serve alcohol such as beer and soju , so that 's a plus . also told there is free parking at the back . the service is really quick and the only downside is they accept debit / credit with orders over $ 20 . you will definitely come out smelling like korean food after !
asian	and while it 's not overwhelmingly impressive the order is always right and i know what to expect . friendly service goes a long way as well . i always do carry out .
asian	done takeout and ate in person a few times . taken friends here and they loved the food , including a vegetarian friend . kalbi is great , so are the stews . korean stews can be super delicious , and i 've had their soondoobu chigae , and kimchi chigae . not the best korean ive ever had , but the best ive had so far in toronto . ambience not so nice , looks ugly . went in once on a warm day and decided not to eat there because of the no-air conditioning .
asian	we eat in fairly often and place to-go orders even more frequently . always correct , always good food .
asian	family owned and operated . have never had a bad experience ordering take out .
asian	besides the salad , i think they have the best kbbq appetizers . our server julian was great and very cute lol
asian	it 's excellent food . consistently excellent which is rare for chinese food in toronto . the ginger beef is incredible . it 's clean inside with great service .
asian	yum ! my mom and my favorite neighborhood asian noodles . great sushi as well . they could do a bit better on their music selection though : p
asian	2 ) bun bo hue - some spicy thick noodle dish , i love the spice , also incredibly salty , 3 ) bbq pork or pork with chicken on rice . 4 ) beef curry with rice 5 ) oh ofcourse , spring rolls are awesome. yum , a little bit over dose on msg , but i will come again .
asian	even when they are super busy she always makes us feel like we are her most loyal customers and that we are getting special treatment . love this place for the orange chicken lunch special . tons of food and very well priced . how do they make it so good and sell it so cheap ? it 's not rubbery mystery meat it is real chicken
asian	not much to say other then the reason i come back is a semi distinct quality to their dishes , at reasonable prices . a strong 4
asian	best prices pho in town , service on point and food is always delicious ! i order the huge combination pho bowl usually but today i have an upset tummy so the 3b will do which is just meatball pho . veggies are always fresh and soup hot , spring rolls are amazing as well . inside a asian market so you can shop after
asian	i love the pho and number 27 vietnamese salad with noodles . i drive over 30 miles to eat ! ! ! !
asian	the all you can eat sushi is great . staff is polite and quick . one of my favorites in cornelius
asian	the wait times are a bit long but still so yummy . could have more sauces and combinations with ginger etc the way dumplings are traditionally eaten .
asian	service is quick and yes ladies are aggressive with the carts but its fun trying to say yes and no to them since we cant understand each other .
asian	very old skool , small spot . nothing super stands out on the menu , it 's all 4 star . papaya salad and the fried fish are personal faves . very tasty , friendly and quick and not expensive .
asian	great staff great food ! on top of that they have boba tea inside ! come in and get your self a boba and some awesome food ! i work in the restaurant industry and couldn 't be happier with the hospitality here !
asian	i come here at least twice every week . i might be addicted .
asian	great food , fast delivery , and friendly service .
asian	soup was awesome as well as the orange chicken ! !
asian	love that they offer brown rice as an option . screaming orgasm is one if my absolute favorites . will definitely be back .
asian	talk about the freshest sushi in las vegas , for a great price too ! one of my all time favorite restaurants ! service is always impeccable , everyone is so friendly even the sushi chefs and owner !
asian	all the baos are great , enoki and braised beef are my faves .
asian	the wait staff is always pleasant and the food is always good ! i don 't like spicy food and they tone the spiciness down just to how i want it . i also like the ambience - the orchids inside and the garden outside.favorite is the duck basil with that tasty boneless duck , the pad see ew , and the sweet rice mango dessert .
asian	love the hot and sour soup . you cant get better value and quality than this !
asian	i 'm always happy with the food ! i haven 't had a bad experience yet ! ! ! there fried rice seems less greasy then other restaurants around i 've been to , and i love that !
asian	very good quality , quick like a rabbit w your order and sure to be smiling .
asian	clean , friendly and the best chinese fusion in the area . been coming to flos for over a decade .. saturday 6.00 lunch .. amazing ! salad + seems like over 20 + items to choose from for sat special . i would come and pay full price : ) arrive before 12 noon the place will be packed by 12 : 10 . -flos bbq pork + chicken fried rice always a must . chili oil and their yummy salad with their signature dressing . delish ! support local ! your belly will thank you .
asian	portions are substantial curries are excellent . i always go for their tom kha gai - a meal unto itself . pad thai solid . service is friendly . arrive early for lunch or tables are a problem . reservations for dinner on weekends adviseable .
asian	we 've never been disappointed . get the orange chicken ...
asian	cannot get enough of this food and great service ! ! try the meat combination and the tabouli .. you will not be disappointed !
asian	ive done dine in , delivery and pick up and they 've always been superb . even when it 's a crazy busy night at dinner when im calling for delivery oand their phone is ringing off the hook , they give me courtesy and professionalism as they take my order . the teriyaki chicken , kung pao , bbq pork fried rice , whatever you get is delicious especially if you have special requests like no onions ! they do great work , consistently ! love it ! the staff rules too ! ! ! !
asian	the potstickers are some of the best in town ! great for take out or dining in if you time your visit right . the chicken fried chicken over fried rice , potstickers , beef salad and pineapple fried rice are really good . the only complaint i would have is you have to be carefull on your spicy level as it seems one cook goes too out and the other is just right . always safer to go lower ...
asian	never disappointed . fast , cheap and good . big wong is great in terms of price and the quality of the food . although , i gotta give it up to the owner who is literally a one man show .. he takes order , serves and cleans . very hard working and for that , i always tip generously . i 've seen restaurants of that size whit 2 workers and they cannot function like him . three words . big wong beast .
asian	they serve up some tasty ramen . i usually order the miso although the tonkatsu is tasty as well . the gyoza is good too . i ordered a small rice bowl one time but the ramen is enough and i struggled to finish both .
asian	soft and the flavors are great my favorite is the lemon pepper . when u check in u get a free jerky stick so check in . it 's owned by ppl from hawaii which is great too . they have a lot of snacks that hawaii sell it 's where my family that lives in vegas goes when they need some lol . great store it gets busy and it 's a small place but go check it out .
asian	the staff is super attentive and nice . love the serve yourself wall of fresh foods so you can control your own portions .
asian	the service is amazing they really do pay attention to their customers they offer discounts and $ 20 off certain holidays and birthdays ! such great quality food it 's a little pricy but so worth it with it being you eat as much as you can stomach ! be careful with the card they give you because once you turn it green it 's over lol be prepared for a lot of food coming your way ! ! we will be back very soon ! !
asian	this hidden gem is amongst all the car dealerships , make sure not to miss it ! hands down the best spicy crispy salmon i 've ever had ! i love how the rolls are large and the seaweed is on the outside ! this place isn 't overly expensive but it 's not something i can afford weekly . you can 't go wrong with anything off the menu- the fish is fresh and they 're generous with the thickness of their sashimi ! i 've been here on several occasions and it 's always been 10 / 10 !
asian	amazing food . looks like they just renovated it . not sure if management changed but the food is good as always .
asian	there 's also enough food to where i always have enough for a second meal . have tried other hawaiian places in the north las vegas area and they just don 't compare ~
asian	the all-you-can-eat comes in made-to-order small portions , so you can taste and share everything their menu has to offer ! i keep coming back , and am always pleased with both the food and the friendly service . they have an awesome little shop in front too , where you can buy their homemade vegetation delights and meat substitutes !
asian	i usually have simple orders . delicious food all around . i 've eaten inside before . interior is okay . its all about the food .
asian	for asian service this has to be the best in town ! i eat at this place 2-4 times a month ! love love love the food ! always fast and fresh . the deco is really traditional and beautiful . the bathroom is super clean and smells good and i love the coconut scrub they have to wash your hands . very cool ! u can even buy some and i did and its great ! ! ! !
asian	food is fresh and delicious . we had chicken satay , chicken fried rice and pad se ew . delicious . that was my first time having pad se ew and i loved it . had a similar dish out of town so i was trying to find their very . i successfully found it . the place is the perfect setting for a romantic dinner or lunch with friends .
asian	great food super fast ! ! ! great prices too ! ! ! amazing lunch deal for 4.95 ! !
asian	we 've been regulars since we moved to this side of town ! great vibe and awesome atmosphere . hubby recommends the big b , i recommend the arizona ! soooooo good ! thank you koma !
asian	tom yum gai soup is my favorite with chicken , great for when i 'm sick and all other times too ! they deliver and always are always on time ! i order from them all the time
asian	where i order there or call it in . good amount of food for a decent price .
asian	they do a discount if you use cash but they take paypal as well which is nice . glad they do take out but dining in is nice to . we will for sure be back and do take out again . the curry is great and the crab rangoon is amazing
asian	i order online all the time and the sandwich was to my door within 5 minutes , which is quicker than it 'd take me to drive over there and order . also , i put in the notes not to ring the doorbell because babies were sleeping and they did just that ! so , thank you !
asian	fast and friendly unlike most of your ex-girlfriends / boyfriends !
asian	only purchase sashimi . always fresh . never ever any fishy smell or taste . attractively presented . if you order lots they throw in a fresh salad , soup ... they are always polite & very grateful for your patronage . pricing is comparable .
asian	never had a problem with the quality of the meats and it remains consistent . service is always on point . refills are there before you can ask for them . so that 's a good thing . price is average . nothing bad to say , so obviously i 'll come back . but then again nothing that makes it stand out .
asian	always fresh . their noodles are so yummy and the portions are quite large . i would do the all you can eat rather than a la carte . i 'm always coming back . it 's great . and not exspensive ! ! !
asian	this is my go to thai restaurant in the west valley , and has been for the last year ( we eat thai a lot ) . staff is always super nice , and the chef will appreciate your thanks with a smile and wave ! thanks guys !
asian	hometown cheers type place for sushi . rocking techno fun music . rising sun will wake you up ! loaded . charlotte must eat .
asian	unless you have a big group , sit at the bar downstairs and enjoy the show . if you want a real experience , try the omakase . if you want 30 % off your entire bill , go during happy hour ( m-f 3-6pm ) . and if drew is working , ask for the vip handroll .. you won 't regret it .
asian	sushi chef , david , never fails to exceed my expectations and i 've been here at least 15 times . he really takes the time to pay attention to what you order and what you enjoy to provide guests with the best recommendations to suit each person 's preferences . also , the modern style sashimi is unlike anything i 've had at any other sushi restaurant , which is why i fell in love here in the first place ! ! this is the only location that the modern sashimi menu is available at ! 10 stars every time .
asian	a drive from anywhere is worth it , pho sure ! top favorites are the seafood pho and broken rice dishes . new menu items , including lobster pho . ordered it , and it did not disappoint .
asian	been going here for 20 + years . always order 2x the mac salad . ramen is flown in fresh . owner and family are very very nice . i used to go here 3 times a week , but i moved too far away . now once a month i 'm lucky to get there .
asian	there 's enough of variety for those who are not so in to pho and get dragged here . lol
asian	we have been going here for the last 5 years to get our sushi fix on ! ! try it - great for cooked or raw fish dishes . the fish is always super fresh here too . you should try it - if you love sushi this is a great place ! !
asian	justina is a riot and always makes me laugh . its great too because its byob ! highly recommend this place . small and quaint inside . homemade recipes
asian	always the best hk cafe , staffs are friendly , food is right to the point and can 't beat the best hk style milk tea in town .
asian	perfect for a small party with smaller and lower priced dishes , you can have many varieties but not hurt ur wallet nor over order . my fiance and i had congee and hot soy milk plus three dishes on the side for only 20 bucks after everything , and all dishes are very tasty , just love this place !
asian	prices and choices are fantastic . lots of options . they serve sushi but didn 't order it . ginger sauce and shrimp sauce available when ordering . all the great things a japanese steak house would have just not the hitachi grill . ( good for kids or 1st dates lol ) tapanyaki noodles with chicken very good and lots of food . hitachi filet cooked perfectly . egg roll was a spring roll and fresh and yummy . service was fast and polite ! will come back again and again
asian	food was hot and fresh and the service was fast . i 'm a big fan of the spicy shoyu .
asian	i had a late night craving for ramen so i went for a simple bowl of hakata ramen , delicious as always . i was extra hungry so i ordered the ole stand by ... gyoza , another excellent dish . everything was great except my server was more interested in some guys at another table so i waited for my water , waited for my order to be taken , waited for my check ... it took much longer than i wanted for a evening snack on a not so busy evening . ramen ... the best in phoenix so far .
asian	always the best service and great , the inside is nice and clean everytime i get a delivery they are very curteous
asian	plus the delivery guy i think his name was bruce is such a cutie .
asian	friendly staff , amazing pho , and would highly recommend to anyone
asian	i can always expect consistent service , decent food ( doesn 't get too salty / oily / full of oyster sauce like some other chinese restaurants ) for a very reasonable price . i will avoid the cheaper end of the menu ( not the desserts ) though , it gets very literal when it says something like " oyster sauce and vegetables "
asian	the pineapple rangoons are the best i 've ever had & the siamin is just what you want if you have an upset stomach . very reasonably priced & made with care .
asian	everything is always so fresh and good quality . i recommend the honey bbl wings ! i want to explore their menu more . i have heard nothing but good things !
asian	they are usually packed on weekends and nights , especially holidays too . service is usually fast and efficient . even when i went for christmas dinner , the lineups went by pretty quick . they have many variety of dishes but what i love most are their fried carrot cakes and deep fried calamari ( asian style ) . i think anything you choose will be of good quality . their morning congee and noodles are delicious too . the restaurant is toward the loud side , as is any chinese dining place right ? : ) but the food is always fresh and steamy - as cantonese people always say " yao wok hay . "
asian	the service is fast and they are always busy , which i take to mean i share my favorable opinion with many other people . i 've worked my way up the spicy levels over the years . finally enjoying 5 out of 5 . if you need me , i make a stop here most wednesdays . they have my most solid of curry recommendations . particularly the massaman and panang . go go go .
asian	nice to be able to count on repeats being the same .
asian	consistently good and friendly . you choose the level of spiciness ( from 1 mild to 5 hot ) . i usually go with # 3 and have sweat dripping from my forehead and i usually pick the pad thai . pretty decent portion sizes and a good selection of vegetarian options as well .
asian	excellent spot . great ambiance . fresh sushi . great thai . check it out .
asian	always thought of going here and finally made it .. incredibly busy but now i know why .. the food is really good .. we had the panang curry , garlic chicken and pad thai .. best i 've had till date .. strongly recommend this place ..
asian	good for business dinner , celebrity special event . raw fish is fantastic .
asian	have never had a bad meal here . some faves : shishito peppers , any of the rolls , the miso cod and cucumber martini are all amazing .
asian	love the fusion dishes - the flavorful sauces pack a bit of punch , so specify your spice level . dining area is small , but we have eaten there no problem . more often , we take out . prices are good .
asian	great selection of both mediterranean and asian food - how often do you find those together ? the owners are polite and attentive . the place is simple , but clean . always the best !
asian	i always get the pork skewers , sticky rice , thai papaya salad , pad thai , and soup . best to go early as the stalls can get crowded lines and sometimes they can run out of food . pad thai especially , usually you are on wait list until they can prepare order . last visit i had some soup and it was an awesome deal for $ 5 !
asian	great atmosphere , great service and great food . only bad thing is that waiting area is located right where the servers come out with food and drinks , constantly have to watch not to hit them in the crammed small area right when you walk in .
asian	i 'd u haven 't been to ycs , its a must ! ! staff is always willing to help u make you 're own sauce or show u how to make their fav sauces for your bowl . and free ice cream ! ! ! cmon : )
asian	a great variety of choices and all very good . i had the ginger lobster stir fried and it was good ! had a very nice waiter and enjoyed my lunch very much . moderately priced and a good bet when friends arrive from out of town . great for groups .
asian	definitely happy to have in southern highlands . usually order the chicken teriyaki , honey walnut shrimp , and the chicken vegetable . always fresh and good . i recommend this chinese restaurant .
asian	place is clean as well . i usually get chicken katsu , bbq chicken or laulau . i don 't recommend the mahi . they also have good banana lumpia that doesn 't have a sugar glaze on the outside . $ 1.75 for 2 .
asian	the staff are friendly . the place is clean . the portions are huge and flavorful . they have a tv and it 's never crowded .
asian	the best diniguan and halo halo i 've had . the people who work there make you feel like you 're family .
asian	we usually get the lunch special . they don 't really speak a lot of english , but it 's ok because it 's still enough to get by . not overly salty like some places . prices of the regular menu is a little better i think than other chinese places .
asian	soup bowls are huge , meal in itself . interior clean , staff nice and friendly .
asian	i do like the fact that you choose one item for lunch special . i am sure this keeps down waste and cost . the only complaint i have had is that one time they did not have brown rice cooked yet for the lunch special .
asian	it 's one of my favourite restaurants . it can be hard to get a table , so we always try to arrive early . love the piano accompaniment with dinner .
asian	for the hell of it , i went in and it was one of the best food decisions i 've ever made . the sashimi is fresh , and finely cut . the sushi rolls themselves are immaculately made and they are very generously in the size of the rolls . easily one of the best sushi spots i 've ever been to , even including my trips to nyc . great spot , great atmosphere , great food .
asian	finally came on a monday evening , it was still packed but was able to get a seat in 20 minutes . khao soi is always a go-to for me at thai restaurants and it was delicious , the beef ! also had the shrimp dish as an appetizer , it was really tasty but warning , the dipping sauce is spicy ! would definitely come back .
asian	well , we were not disappointed . the spring rolls and beef main dinner were excellent . fortunately , the line up started after we were seated .
asian	excellent choice . very fresh spring roll and tasty bahn mi with crusty fresh bread . good thai tea - sweet but like the spice . very good service and reasonable prices . could use a little organizing especially behind the counter as customers can see that and it 's concerning about cleanliness of kitchen .
asian	you basically can create your own bowl or pick a pre-made one . i went for white rice , tuna chunks , yuzu soy sauce , edamame , mango , avocado , carrots , cashews , red onions , pickled ginger , etc . you get a choice of 6 toppings from the veggie selection - it wasn 't easy to choose ! while it was yummy to eat and a fun experience sharing a bowl , it wasn 't very filling ( i split the bowl with someone else ) and it needed more flavour ( hence we were dousing it with sriracha ) . will go back to try different combinations . about $ 17-18 per bowl if you make your own .
asian	the lotus appetizer was good and had a lot of flavour . the mutton / skewers were decent , but there was a bit too much dry spices on it . the braised beef noodles and stir fry noodles were fantastic . both were hand-pulled , came with veggies and were both delicious . coming back for sure ! tip - not a japanese ramen restaurant
asian	every time i 'm in the area they are closed . but i finally got to try it . not a let down at all . great pho ! and wonderful staff
asian	came on a weekday 2 : 00pm no lineup . i got the original large chicken . you can choose between original or spicy ( a few different levels ) . it came out piping hot . i was surprised how large it was . it was a lot of chicken way more then i expected . also it was not deboned . the first bit was full of pepper and the aroma was simply amazing . would visit again .
asian	enjoyed a great lunch here and tried the shrimp fried rolls and silver noodle salad . they were both so delicious ! ! i would be a little more cautious next time though with the spice . i ordered a 6 and it was a bit more spicy than i had probably wanted . i love spice and can usually handle it very well but this spice level threw me a challenge . the service was friendly and attentive . they were quite busy too and they touched our table a satisfactory amount of times . can 't wait to go back ! !
asian	always wanted to try this restaurant and was glad the service and food was really good .
asian	the king of lunch bento is my go to during lunch . they only serve 10 of these a day so it 's a good idea to go early ! the bento is a great way to try a variety of their dishes in snack size . it is super filling and at a great price ( $ 19 ) . you can really tell the quality and effort the cook places on each bento . what you get in the bento changes from time to time as well !
asian	very delicious sushi for very good prices . i cried when i found out it closed because it also happened to be where i met my fiance . the hayashi in surprise , we miss you ! ! !
asian	it 's so bad it 's almost a necessary aspect to the experience , i might even be disappointed if a dumpling night wasn 't paired with a bully of a waitress who makes you feel as though you are doing her a tremendous disservice by ordering anything at all . the dumplings are good though , both fried and steamed , get pork shrimp leek or one of the lamb ones . all in all its kind of a gamble some times better and some times worse , sometimes soupy sometimes dry , but the service never fails to be terrible . i still love this place : )
asian	they have new york cjow mein ! fast , friendly , and they deliver ! our family go to chinese food place .
asian	we are repeaters ! best eggplant ! clean , great parking , full bar .
asian	pickup or delivery is awesome . the food is yummy . everyone is friendly . the restaurant is clean and pretty . what more could you ask for !
asian	staff is consistently friendly and kind . the food is always yummy ! chino is always packed so that should tell you how great they are !
asian	extensive selections of teas smoothies shaved ice and toppings . open late and great selections on late meal menus too !
asian	i plan on making it as my diet ; just enough portion . good food and excellent service ! clean and organized ; always enjoy coming here , after my workout ! way to go teriyaki boy , yummy
asian	close to the office and never disappoints ! i love the taro boba smoothie and always get a regular chicken teriyaki bowl-- yum ! ! it 's right next to the nutrition store so it 's convenient to get some quest bars for an afternoon snack : )
asian	the theatre of people watching late night in this jount is priceless . better than a show on the strip .
asian	juan was our server he was fast getting our food out & great service . we were offered a grill change as soon as our grill got dirty . juan checked on us & made sure our drinks stayed full . the sesame chicken is really good .
asian	stumbled upon this place with a cute clean design and decided to give it a try . its a small place and theres only stools . but its comfortable enough . i came pretty late so it was fine , if it gets busy it might be crowded . they have a food display so if youre ever indecisive like me or dont know what you want to order , theyre really helpful and theyll show you : p got two combos . the salmon doshi with salad and the tuna doshi with taro chips . they were both really good . love the presentation of it . creative idea !
asian	as far as the other workers they didn 't acknowledged me when i walked in . as i order and pay for my food they didn 't say thank you and ignore me for the most part . the food it was pretty decent , but the customer service needs a bit of work . update : customer service improved .
asian	they have some of the best thai food in the valley , fosho . ( and i 'm a thai food junkie ) unfortunately they don 't deliver , but it 's worth the extra time to pick up for take-out . : ) highly recommend !
asian	my boyfriend agreed that it was the best and quickest lunch we 've ever had , so that 's saying something . we will definitely be back ! thank you for having such an excellent restaurant !
asian	it was worth every single cent . some of the best food i 've eaten on this trip , with a huge selection from all sorts of different styles of cuisine . it was wonderful .
asian	so fresh and flavourful ! the service is great and the food is delicious ! i 'll definitely return .
asian	flavors are more subtle but perfect for the palette . each dish is carefully crafted to mix just the right flavor with texture and yes ... aroma . best thai food ever - hands down .
asian	everything is vegan and almost everything is gluten-free . the staff is amazingly friendly and super helpful . the food is very very very tasty . the price is right , and the menu is very creative . eaten there a few times with a good friend , and have never been disappointed . i would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to venture into vegan cuisine . vanessa the server is a sweetheart ! kudos for her !
asian	great food . really relaxing . my parents loved it ! had the lamb brain , very interesting and decent dish . not so pricey as well .
asian	freshest sushi i have ever had . i 've had sushi at so many different places and there 's is top notch . loved the mount everest roll . the real show stopper was the sushi tacos . so creative and flavorful . they were a huge hit with my brain and i ! the tuna poki bowl was also incredible and a huge portion . loved loved loved this place and will be back . staff was friendly and prompt !
asian	wow ! it did not disappoint ! i ordered a wrap , my first time trying one and it was a huge bite of deliciousness ! i had salmon , spicy tuna , red onions , cilantro , green onions , both spicy and regular crab salad , furikake and fried onions to finish . it tasted so fresh and the price to portion ratio was ideal ! can 't wait to come back with my daughter to share this excellent food experience ! left completely stuffed and in a glorious food coma .
asian	i 've never been let down here , carry-out or dine-in . i rave about these guys to anyone with ears .
asian	you step into this little house and its like you are transported away from toronto into a place with delicious food and drinks and amazing service i am still dreaming about the mushroom vermicelli and the tigers milk ceviche was some of the best cevice i have ever had . be warned that you may have to wait for a table . but it is worth it !
asian	this is my new lunch place , at least once a week . maybe another time for dinner . super cheap and everything i 've tried is delish . thai noodle house potstickers , any curry , and tom kha are a must !
asian	tried it for the first time tonight . delivery was slow but most certainly worth the wait . ribs very tender , crab fried rice was off the hook !
asian	the prices are pretty fair as well , which is great . the people who work there were fairly nice as well , which is always a plus . = ) i will definitely continue to shop here ! = d
asian	this is my wife 's favorite restaurant . it has great atmosphere and is not a " chain " japanese restaurant . highly recommended .
asian	it is prepared fresh and taste delicious . you should check it out .
asian	i do not agree with having a separate charge for rice .
asian	i had two rolls : caterpillar and salmon . i loved the elsa malbec with the rich , flavorful sushi . our server was sweet and smart simultaneously , a rare combination . the atmosphere rocks . you just have to try this place !
asian	limited menu means they know what they 're doing . this sounds crazy but their vegetable sides ( green beans or brussel sprouts ) are the best ever . i wish i knew how they prepared them . i 'd eat them every day . i 'm also a fan of turkey congee which is a perfect winter soup . thick and delicious with fresh green onion . the dumplings are pretty dope . i like the classic the best . the alternative ones just lack in texture . be aware they sometimes run out of things .
asian	rolls were really big ! ! a little pricey but that comes with the location 90 for 3 people and that was with two dishes of yummy mochi ! ! super cute inside too
asian	ordered the ribs . they were the way chinese spareribs are supposed to be . the moo goo gai pan was excellent as well as the happy family . this is as close to new york style chinese food that i have found in vegas . highly recommended ! ! ! ! !
asian	it is my favorite thai restaurant and could be the best in pittsburgh . i 've been to silk elephant and a couple thai restaurants near west penn hospital as well . i just think that the food is very flavorful , staff is very friendly and attentive , and as of recently they started serving alcohol . the food is inexpensive . unlike some of the indian restaurants this place is very spot on with the desired spice level . if you ask for 10 / 10 it will be spicy . it is one of the few places in my life for which i lack the frustration of not being able to order a dish very very spicy .
asian	i love that it 's a casual setting with simple yet amazing food . my wife and i shared the pulled pork bao , 5 spice porkbelly sandwich and the khimchi fries with pulled pork . the quantity was great was the price and i do recommend this place to anyone looking to have some tasty food .
asian	soooo good ! we had sushi and poke bowls ! food was amazing ! reasonably priced . service was super nice - they are brand new open so still working out the quirks - give grace ... it 's so worth it ! thanks derek !
asian	the chicken katsu curry is life changing and this place knows what a 10 spice level is . if you like spicy food this is it . the curry is perfectly balanced in flavor and spice . the rice is also cooked to perfection . i always order the chicken katsu or tofu katsu with beef at a 7 spice level so i can devour the whole thing . service is iffy but they keep a skeleton crew on the floor so it is understandable .
asian	18 pieces , ginger , plus ice cream dessert . three sushi chefs and two servers for a small intimidate party .
asian	$ 26 and some for all you can eat ( an hour to order sushi and grilled items ) super white tuna , pork belly , hamachi , red dragon roll , hurricane roll , teri chicken roll and everything else recommended ! ! ! the fish we were served was fresh and good quality ! none tasted dry and better yet , no fatty strands . we had a few mix-ups on orders but it wasn 't a big deal since our party was pretty big . great service and they had a lot of patience and kept their cool .
asian	we had a $ 200 resort comp so we decided to dine at our hotel 's blue ribbon award winning sushi restaurant . the food , presentation , quality was very good . we got the duck tacos which where absolutely full of rich flavor , we also got a toro toro roll which consists of toro " fatty tuna belly , " and a kampachi roll with jalapeno . their cherry green tea is the absolute best i have tried ! our total for 2 rolls 1 appetizer and 2 soups was $ 160 which the hotel comped for us . thank you aria las vegas !
asian	absolutely amazing . sit at the bar so you can watch them hand make the dumplings , pulled noodles and knife-shaved noodles while you wait for your order . we had the dan-dan noodle , chicken chow mein , and beef & onion pot sticker . i would order everything again . left here stuffed to the brim and 100 % satisfied .
asian	absolutely love this place ! came from chicago & have been here twice ! i could eat here everyday & wish this place were closer ( happy to travel here though just to eat here ) .
asian	aburi style sushi is all i ever want to eat . this place is great . such fresh sushi , great ambiance and great service .
asian	accidentally found it and soooo glad i did . food was perfectly yummy . i had the " sun of the beach " roll . unfortunately i don 't live here or i would eat here once a week for sure : )
asian	a delicious and freshly prepared feast . prices are higher than average but for the quality and taste , it is a steal ! ! worth so much more . what an great experience ; my tastebuds want more ! ! 5 stars are not enough !
asian	this hidden gem , despite its unassuming presence in a random strip mall with limited dining area , was lucky to dine in with no one else seated . the host is super nice and hospitable and made recommendations . 4 dishes with plenty of leftovers came out to under $ 40 . all dishes were on point . when i 'm in the area again , would definitely visit again . much better than those large ' congee time / wong / queen ' in terms of value and taste .
asian	amazing affordable food - soup and dessert is always delicious , great for takeout because the seating is a bit crowded .
asian	after being in the madness of the strip for a few days you just want to have a nice quiet dinner , exactly what we got . holy cow the food was delicious and filling . i only wish i lived closer , you know for those sushi cravings : d
asian	a group of us go every friday for co-worker / group lunch . the staff there will recognize us and seat us as quickly as possible ( on a friday at noon , it understandably takes time sometimes ) . service has always been impeccable , drinks are refilled and we 're checked on multiple times during the meal . food is fantastic ! high quality sashimi and the range of available rolls is great ! everything costs what you would expect and nothing is overpriced . always look forward to friday lunch here as it is a treat to end the week on !
asian	a hip slant on traditional vietnamese food . great service and amazing food . highly recomended .
asian	a home of genuine japanese cuisine ! the meals are generous , food is amazing ! everything was delicious ! my date was thoroughly impressed and she is not big on asian . between the two of us we had udon ( rich and flavorful ) , miso soup ( large pieces of tofu ) , chicken teriyaki on brown rice ( couldn 't even tell it was brown rice ) , tempura ( amazing ) , gyoza , and sesame salad . very pleased , will definitely be going back to try the rest of the menu ! !
asian	busy but worth the wait ! ! too many items to choose from . will back next time in vegas .
asian	all 5 star reviews are right on ! 2nd time was as good as first ! 4 course with wine / saki pairings each time . omg !
asian	we made reservations 2 months in advanced and now i know why it was so important . this place was packed so be prepared , but they seated us quickly , brought our drinks and food quickly and we all left with a smile . we ordered 13 entrees and all shares bc we 've just heard such great things . the coconut curry with crispy duck , garlic sea bass , pad thai , green curry , beef and coconut peanut sauce , garlic prawns , soft shell crab drunken noodle and pineapple fried rice were just a few i could remember and it was all phenomenal . looking forward to coming back here and sharing the experience with whoever i 'm with !
asian	all i have to say is amazing ! ! everything was incredible .. from the service and atmosphere to the food everything was perfect . i had the spicy roman which is to die for . perfect flavor and spice . super chill atmosphere that can be a perfect afternoon lunch spot or a fancy date night . this place comes highly recommended ! !
asian	amazing all u can eat sushi but wish the staff was little nicer otherwise it 's amazing
asian	loved all their special rolls . the desserts were also great especially the coffee pudding .
asian	we ordered dishes for the tabled and shared . portions were small so we tried out a lot of different dishes . every single one was delicious . will definitely return .
asian	live out of town and will be coming here every time i am in vegas from now till forever ! ! ! the garlic tuna is amazing ! service is great , atmosphere is great as well .
asian	byow super fresh , service is excellent and food very tasty . place is not small and not noisy as normally a restaurant that size would be great for a date , business meeting or just to hangout with friends and enjoy an amazing sushi can 't wait to go back as even their ice cream is delicious
asian	great service and they even have mouthwash in the bathroom ( great for date night ; )
asian	fresh fresh fresh ! ! every roll you can think of and regular sushi , delicious desserts make sure you save room ! ! better than these other seafood buffets and a better price ! prices have gone up about a follow from the photo i took but these are photos from pretty much the whole line up at lunch today , something for everyone if you love seafood hughly recomend i wish my tummy was bigger i would have had more than three rounds ! ! will post second review so i can include all photos ! chocolate fondue and amazing white chocolate raspberry treats everything was good the sushi and calamari i could go all day
asian	sushi rolls made to order and unlimited sushi ! the service was really good however there were 4 people coming around to serve us that we were asked the dance question several times which got annoying but otherwise the most best sushi selection and really flavorful ! not much room for big parties and dinner is packed . lunch is the best time to go . i 'd say hidden gem !
asian	always craving poke and this place does not disappoint . the small size is super filling because they have soo many vegetables and toppings with no restrictions on how much you can fill in your bowl . prices are very reasonable ! i love how they have kimchi too . everyone who works there is super friendly as well . my new lunch spot !
asian	all the food is fresh and very different from all other japanese places . a must try : fried chicken , otto binimbap , calamari ! ! the salads are super good as well .
asian	spicy pork bulgogi is amazing ! great potatoes , salad , kimchee is great too ! all around freat place good atmosphere and open late ! coworkers and i get together a few times a month to meet here ! good prices , good service and easy parking .
asian	amazing amazing amazing ! i came for my birthday with twelve people , we feasted like royalty on 15 different dishes , brought our own booze , had an amazing time all for under $ 200 bucks . the service was exceptional and the lok lak and fish amok was better than any i ever had in cambodia . go eat at this restaurant ! now !
asian	amazing . amazing . amazing ! so delicious . this is not a restaurant , it 's a market with poke by the pound . authentic hawaiian . they will make you a poke bowl with however much poke , rice , and even seaweed salad you want . the quality of the tuna far surpasses any other poke place i 've tried . specifically these new ones popping up around town . want fresh , incredible fish ? go here .
asian	best thai food i 've had since i went to thailand ... it 's pretty much comparable . price is reasonable , service is fantastic and the food is unforgettable .
asian	by far the best sushi i ever had in my life . i am happy to admit im a local here . i come as often as humanly possible . i first discovered this place about two months ago . everything is good . my favorite is the crispy rice appitizer . it 's just yum. matter of fact ... i am heading there now ! they 're open late , perfect for the casino workers and late night crowd like us !
asian	couldnt tell you how pretty the decor is ! i am ususally not a big fan of buffet , but this place is a must try ! there are 12 live cook stations. from italian , to japanese , to live seafood. their desert station is probably the best in the entire buffet ! best buffet in town ! ! !
asian	from chicken kebob to chicken schnitzel . food is absolutely amazing ! and i love how they have a patio ! their drinks are also portioned properly ! this may not mean much : but they allow to bring your own cake for celebration . which is a huge plus for us . my favourite place to be during summer evenings
asian	great value , service and unmatched quality . we eat sushi all over the u.s. and this was the best quality and value . had premium sashimi , several orders of wonderful sushi , uni sampler , eel and more . sake offerings are fantastic ! don 't walk ..... run to this pace . excited to come back again .
asian	i highly recommend this place . it was so good . they have great inside and outside searing . i had the massaman chicken . it 's the best curry i 've ever had . the service is a great and the food is outstanding . go try it !
asian	i love their cucumber salad , their tempura is delicious without being soggy , the bento combos are adorable and overflowing with food .. and oh yeah , the sushi is amazing .
asian	the crispy duck is a must have . so sad i 'm leaving vegas tmrw . strongly recommend to come early ( like before 6 pm ) the waiting time can be as long as 2 hours !
asian	this is one of the best hawaiian places ive evr eaten , after eating here you won 't even remember " l & l or aloha kitchen " not that those aren 't good but island flavors is the best ! ! ! the staff is very friendly and very helpful to explain the menu . specials everyday !
asian	my boyfriend and i went in during the most busiest time of the night . we got our food fast and with generous portions as well . there was a line out the door but there was plenty of room for everyone to sit , eat , and enjoy their food . the owner even went around to personally clear your finished plates and he thanked everyone for coming in . the pricing is very reasonable for how much food you get and how great the quality is . overall , i would highly recommend going here .
asian	friendly staff beautifully executed dishes . i work in a forbes four star rated restaurant .. this places dishes my rival my restaurant . best presentation of pad thai ever . bond is an amazing waiter and very accomodating . check this place out .
asian	amazing amazing priced and delicious meals for groups ! my mom kept saying get c get c , something must be good about it ... something about peking . i will report back once i figure it out .
asian	seriously authentic chinese food . salted bake calamari = delicious , tung chou with garlic- yum , beef brisket lo mein hong kong style was amazing , and loved the home style bean curd ( just a tad spicy for kids but very mild for adults ) sautéed pork over ho fun was a bit bland , but the kids loved it and the noodle texture was good . potstickers- so flavorful with great texture , so much more i wanted to try , but portions are huge !
asian	amazing ! ! amazing ! ! ..... simply put .. service-5 .. atmosphere-5 .. price-5 .. food-5 + .... must try ... our server charles was perfect .. ordered all of our dishes and was point on all the way ! john the head chef / owner came to our table upon leaving to see how everything was . very nice guy ! will be back over and over again ! !
asian	amazing ! amazing ! some of the highest quality fish and sushi you will ever find . the sushi melts in your mouth . totally worth the price . highly recommended ! !
asian	been here a few times now and the kitchen is unbelievable . everything is so fresh and flavorful but at the same time simple and authentic . try the oxtail its very tender and delicious . service is fast and friendly . can 't wait to go back . go with a few people so you can share all the different apps .
asian	amazing ! ! ! amazing ! ! that 's all i can say to this restaurant . chef roberto is the best sushi chef in las vegas ! he is very fast and efficient . the food here tastes fresh and delicious . the all you can eat price is reasonable and the inside decoration is nice and if you have kids , they have a giant aquarium tank for them to gaze at . this restaurant has everything you can ask for at a sushi restaurant ! 5 stars for sure ! ! !
asian	the best sushi everrrrrrrrrr ! extremely fast service and amazing servers ! ! my fav roll is the lemon salmon roll as well as the bam bam roll !
asian	amazing ! amazing ! the restaurant is tucked away but it is worth it ! all the food is very tasty and they are sooooo quick ! we ordered and it was literally at our table in less than ten min ( and on a saturday night ! ) ! we asked the waitress most recommended dumpling and she told us to get the pork and chive . i totally agree with her and recommend those dumplings . the food was also reasonably price . just make sure to bring cash , they don 't accept cards ! if i come back to toronto i 'm definitely stopping here !
asian	try the beef jerky egg rolls rib eye salad coconut soup with shrimp friend rice with shrimp desert coconut ice cream with sticky rice everything is incredible every single time ! ! !
asian	walked in and had to wait 20mins for a table . went to the bar across the street in the meantime . squash fritters are to die for ! ! ! had the khao soi with chicken- chicken melted in my mouth . hands down the best thai food i 've ever eaten
asian	we were complete newbies and had no clue how to do anything , but our waitress jamie was super nice and helped us figure it out . we split a small family combo between 4 people and felt like it was a good portion for each of us . the beef is . so . delicious ! highly recommend : )
asian	def would recommend this to anyone , best katsu spot in vegas .
asian	miso cod was a 10 / 10 . tempura shrimp was perfect ! octopus salad was a perfect blend of flavored . lobster roll was ok , not worth $ 35 . only reason for not getting a 5 star was the waitress . she was clearly showing her boobs the whole time ... problem is , i was with my wife and mother-in-law . then , when serving other patrons , her low skirt revealed everything ... funny thing , you could hear the other servers / waiters talking about her attire .
asian	it may be a little hole in the wall but the food is so worth it ! ! ! ! ! ! they have all you can eat menu , you pay $ 20 a person and . an order as much as you want as long as it is from that menu . if not you can still order what you want !
asian	i went twice while visiting phoenix and i know once i move there , this will be a favorite for sure . the spring rolls are super fresh and delicious and the pho tai is my favorite . huge and filling and so flavorful ! the location is small but has super cute outdoor seating and its very nice inside .
asian	amazing sushi , amazing service , amazing prices ! i 've heard about this place for a while and decided to try it out one day . i am so glad i did . it has become my new favorite sushi place . they have a fantastic happy hour ( that seem to last all day ) and they have great quality sushi . highly recommended .
asian	best in the area hands down . everything i 've ever ordered here has been really delicious . very clean and professional , excellent service . would defintiely return over and over . yes it is a little pricey , but it 's definitely reflected in the huge portion sizes and how delicious and fresh their food is ! things i 've tried and loved : mushroom butter yaki spicy sushi cake ( must must try ) albacore tuna salad f.w.d. fire white dragon roll blue mountain roll ( man this is huge and comes with a mountain of spicy salmon and tempora bits ) new face roll
asian	and the gap between sushi rolls was kind of ridiculous , but you know what it 's worth it for cheap but great sushi . i 've been twice and both times the sushi was filling and very appetizing , very great service as in they know how to speak to you with respect . i 'd recommend people coming here , and at 21.99 all you can eat it 's a bargain ! recommend forsure ! waitresses are also hit or miss , they are either very friendly or very rude .
asian	each dish we ordered was clearly prepared with much love and care . the chow mein noodles were fantastic and the tom yum soup was a delight . we loved the experience so much that we 're here again for lunch this time . highly recommended !
asian	amazing ambiance , excellent service , and scrumptious food choo cheee ... choo cheee every time and anytime ... this place rocks !
asian	amazing service ! a must come if you 're in the area ! love the cute decor ! extensive selection of alcohol ranging from sake , japanese beer and regular beer ! family friendly and overall a happy place to enjoy sushi ! cleanliness is a plus too ! very happy with this place !
asian	i had the thai islamic noodles and they were to die for . will definitely be back !
asian	would def recommend for seafood lovers and raw oyster lovers alike ! 2 thumbs up and if i could give it 6 stars i would !
asian	looks great on the inside . tried the satay chicken and chef nuit pad thai with shrimps in super spicy ( level 4 i think ) . we got there and there was no line-up . it was a sunday at around 5 . line-up started just a few minutes after we got there . service was great too . didn 't wait long for the food even though the place was packed .
asian	a must go ! chicken wings , beef and pork rolled in betel leaves and the ribs are a must !
asian	a must stop for anyone in vegas . staff was very helpful with food and drink selections . best sake selection i have seen in the us . i will definitely return again as for the price and what you get it is a no-brainer : )
asian	a must try experience . finally a korean bbq that you can go to and come back again and again . our epicurean guide , dosum , made sure our first visit was exceptional . the gm nick came to our table to see how we were doing often . the food is so good , once cooked the meat melts in your mouth .
asian	the food is delicious , the atmosphere is perfect , and the service is spectacular . we got our entrees in under 10 minutes , but it tasted like it too an hour to cook . just eat here now !
asian	service was not the best , but they stepped it up . i love number 8 all day . it 's marinated thinly sliced beef in a sweet , smokey broth . there are sliced carrots and other vegetables mixed too . they bring it out in a boiling stone pot and every main dish comes with korean sides and rice . small menu but every item is real good . small strange place in mall , but always clean table and cutlery .
asian	friendly staff and the rolls were delicious and fresh . made with extreme care and pride right in front of you . the wasabi was a little thin and weak for me but to my family it seemed just right . we will be back .
asian	not westernized and they don 't cut corners . the banh xeo and bun cha are both must eats . i didn 't get a chance to try their bun bo , but plan to next time i 'm here .
asian	really cheap and extremely unique for great quality food . definitely coming back
asian	the chef is extremely friendly and the staff is incredible ! the sushi is so fresh and amazing ! the omakase is so good and personalized . the rolls are incredible . i will definitely be back !
asian	amazing and crave-worthy ... wanna blow their minds ? be caucasian and order # 8 ... you 're welcome .
asian	service is impeccable ; sushi and sashimi is the freshest we have ever had . such a terrific experience ! everyone working here has worked at top sushi restaurants from the strip , and they all take pride in what they do . and it shows . the rolls are fantastic , but the highlight is the fresh fish . for example , even the most basic california roll is created with real crab . it 's nobu quality without the pretentiousness or the price . : )
asian	beautifully presented . just an overall win . brisk service . do yourself a favor and eat here !
asian	my first time trying somalian food but won 't be my last amazing meals including chicken sabaya and rice and also their famous beef samosas are to die for . super underrated !
asian	my favorite place now . small dining area . great staff . great service . the spicy beef noodle was perfecto ! ! ! their signature beef noodle dish was very very good too . steamed chicken dumplings were yummy ! it is worth the wait if the dining area is full . sitting at the bar was easy and quick . loved watching the chefs making the noodles . pretty sure the owner came by to check on us as well . i highly recommend to everyone !
asian	our service is always top notch . we used to dine at sushi-mon every time , that was until the first time we came here and haven 't looked back since ! ! this is the spot to try ! ! don 't let the last 3 terrible businesses located here change your mind ! ! this place is remodeled and completely cleaned up ! ! fresh fresh fresh , what else do you want at a sushi bar ! !
asian	it 's a great place for large groups and families too ! i appreciate the fact that we can make reservations here , unlike the other ramen and guu-like restaurants / bars . my favourite is the pork belly dish , salads and ramen ! a satisfying and filling meal ! i would skip the lineup at other japanese restaurant and head over here instead ! !
asian	first time here tonight and it will be added to one of our vegas favorites . short rib rice was probably the best i ever had . chicken pad thai was also delicious . definately will be back soon next time we come back to vegas !
asian	fantastic customer service as well . definitely recommend . the * crunchy calamari roll * is to die for !
asian	i love the exceptional guest service . it is friendly professional and extended through much kindness . try this place and i think you will make it one of your " must go favorites . " to truly experience this food you must celebrate the tradition , this is not american version japanese food . it is the real deal .
asian	the owners super nice as well . momo 's are out of this world .
asian	we order from summer house all the time because the food is delicious and you can 't beat the pricing ! my favorite is the deep fried spicy shrimp and bbq chicken . the dipping sauce is what makes theses dishes so great . the chef is so friendly and his staff are amazing people as well . their customer service is great . we ordered large party trays for take out last minute and the chef didn 't turn us down . he kindly took our order and even delivered it to our home . i was so pleased ! thank you so much summer house !
asian	i 've eaten at many teppanyaki places and they 're usually all about the show and the food is ok . this place had both , good show and delicious food . we had chef octavio . he made amazing sauces for our lobster , shrimp , ribeye , filet etc . garlic sauce , lemon butter , teriyaki ... we were stuffed . great price for what you get .
asian	thanks to the manager leo , who has always been so much helpful ! must-try place ! ! ! !
asian	they greet you with traditional japanese greeting and the layout of the place reminded me of japan . the menu was no surprise , traditional ramen and sides . simply amazing place and happy phoenix added this place . it will be a weekly stop for sure ! some places fail to make the perfect ramen , not here . it 's a must try if you never had ramen before .
asian	great service . a little pricier than the places i usually eat but i 'll be back for sure , just not every week . : - )
asian	don 't go there expecting to eat a cookie-cut california roll . sit at the sushi bar if you can and order what the chef recommends for you . very friendly group of individuals who love what they do . : ) loved it !
asian	their drinks are also delicious and are beautifully executed along with the food . favourites include : truffle fried rice , pumpkin truffle ravioli , and fried watermelon . i forget the name of the drink ( first on the cocktail menu ) it comes in a brass pineapple and is so good ! ! service is always friendly too ! it 's always pretty busy but i 'm always accommodated overall consistent and delicious food !
asian	everything tastes good - i like ordering from their daily specials , especially amaebi ( sp ? ) when they have it . love the atmosphere - go with friends and share lots of dishes . and it 's so cheap for the quality of food .
asian	ginger crispy chicken with white meat , green beans , hot & sour soup . hands down the best chinese food restaurant in canada ( and possibly even the us ) . brought a friend from ny 3 years ago and she still raves about this place .
asian	rolls start around $ 4 for 8 pieces , we bought four and it filled up the both of us . great dinner or lunch date for under $ 25 ! ! ! so yummy ! !
asian	definitely will come back to try their specialty soups and other dishes
asian	amazing appetizers , including all the egg / spring rolls and calamari !

asian	food , service , and people are so great . we live in south chandler and won 't eat chinese anywhere in the valley except here . lots of food goes home with us . try the sizzling beef and scallops .
asian	i been going here for years and i love it . i had a friend that worked there and told me the fish is flown in daily . not surprised as it always tastes fresh and mouth watering . i suggest ordering one of the sashimi bowls and this amazing roll wrapped in cucumber ( forgot name ) . the best thing about this place is the delicious food at a great price . i have been to a lot of places in the surrounding areas and i always go back to sakana . also they have a ton of daily specials and wait for it ............. half shell oysters ! ! yummy ! ok now i 'm hungry !
asian	i have never been disappointed . i have been to fogo in beverly hills only . but then tried this for the first time today for lunch . when we noticed lunch was only $ 30 we jumped on it ! we were wondering if there would be less of a meat selection due to it being lunch-but nope ! the same great meats and excellent service . i love this place . if you want some delicious tasting meats and love the all you can eat experience-you must come here ! you will not be disappointed ! i promise ! ! ! ! !

asian	royal with cheese is quickly becoming one of my favorites . definitely recommend that one . it 's amazing how many times we 've come to this place and they 've always remained consistently great .
asian	service and food so good . totally worth the money for the all you can eat .
asian	stir friend beef tongue is a must ! we ordered 2 of them again and omg it 's good . we also ordered grilled whole squid and of course the honey toast . eat here at $ and avoid the crazy expensive meals on the strip .
asian	we are ready to get check out red ginger .. we love the sushi here but the presentation just keeps getting better ...
asian	as a new yorker used to the best we were so happily impressed and service was great but the food was the best part . every dish was cooked to perfection it was like eating in china town . we are already planning coming back and what we can take home . don 't hesitate to take a chance on sat or sunday dim sum-this is the place .
asian	as a vegetarian , i was extremely pleased with all the options ! ! they are all delicious ! everything i 've ever gotten here has been amazing ! i strongly recommend this place for chinese food at a fair price !
asian	had crab puffs , spring rolls , orange chicken , sweet and pungent chicken , and my son had teriyaki chicken . he never finshes his food and he cleaned the plate . the portions are huge ! love it here
asian	i get it every time . crisp , fresh , flavorful- especially with the crispy tofu on top .
asian	get a variety and go all out . don 't miss the in tail that was my favorite . but honestly it 's all great . amazing cocktails and fun atmosphere is come back .
asian	i love the curry noodles with tofu most but the orange chicken is amazing ! the owner is really friendly and the food is consistently good !
asian	great environment , fast service and the pricing is solid . if you want great asian food this is a dang good option . i had the kpow chicken but i try their orange beef and it was great .
asian	z 's recipes are from her grandmother . everything is super fresh and is some of the best thai i 've had ! the tom kah soup is the best you 'll find- the leaves and roots are blended so there 's nothing to pick out . and all of the coconut milk dishes and curries are so rich and flavorful ! all the spice blends are ground by z 's . everything we ordered was fabulous and we 'll be back , many more times !
asian	service is incredible and the owner treats you like family . order the beef . i don 't even know the technical name for it but the beef dish is excellent ! ! ! awesome spot .
asian	ask about the specials . the mackerel fish fried dumplings are unreal !
asian	i go to this pho spot after every edc the ac is blasting and the food is great . recovery to the fullest
asian	the food is great and the service is exceptional . it 's not just good for sushi , the udon here is the best we 've had in vegas .
asian	what a beautiful and welcoming place . the menu is a delight , it doesn 't often happen that i come across this many options that i 'd like to try . highlight for me was the ponzu steak with frites , incredibly tender and tasteful steak . mushroom skewers were another highlight , with a delicate taste of their yakitori grill . i was delighted to see that their amazing buns from umami made it onto the menu . prices are very fair . can 't wait to come back .
asian	amazing atmosphere and cozy environment the staff is very attentive and friendly as well
asian	a newly opened japanese modern fusion restaurant overlooking the 215 and las vegas valley . the customer service was delightful and attentive . the menu has various choices to suit mostly every craving . must tries are hawaiian breeze roll , angry lobster roll , pork belly , and for a taste of the restaurants fresh fish get the sushi dinner composed of the chefs choosing . pricing is standard for casual dining ( $ 10- $ 15 a plate ) but the quality of food is beyond expectations .
asian	i came here with my girlfriend over labor day weekend and had a very pleasant experience . we had baked crab , rock shrimp , and the brussel sprouts to start . what an excellent balance of flavor on the sprouts ! i would highly recommend them . our main rolls were the tiger and corn crunch . by far my favorite roll would be the tiger . such an excellent mixture of flavor profiles . the chefs even brought us a free piece of cod ! it was a great touch to our meal . i would highly recommend katsuya and will be back again in the future !
asian	dale is the best - easy to talk to and makes great sushi ! sat at the bar top and got our food quick . second time here and it doesn 't disappoint ! check in on yelp for free sake ! ! yum yum
asian	the night club is the best and the food is off he chart !
asian	atmosphere is great ! when you walk in a " ramen ambassador " helps you with ordering amd what to choose. lucky for us it was chef josh. so exciting and fun to interact with him. their sake selection is well chosen and varied in price / grade. plus their house wine is az and $ 8 / glass . i love the az support and it 's delicious. the noodles were perfect. the flavors were balanced amd the broth was complicated without being too rich. bonus the food came out really fast ! ( i 'm always starving so this is really important to me ) in general , a great noodle shop !
asian	from the moment we walked in the staff was attentive and welcoming . we ordered the chef 's selection for the evening with wine pairing ..... everything was beyond expectations ! we highly recommend wing lei and will be back again and again !
asian	super modern decor , and very fresh food ! the staff is friendly and helpful . the pho was delicious ! the egg rolls were yummy . the bbq beef sandwich was great : ) i will definitely be coming back and making this my regular west side pho place !
asian	the only poor post to this experience was the beef broth meal . the beef was overcooked and the broth not very enjoyable . if stay away from this option to have a fantastic experience !
asian	the beef panang curry was perfectly flavored and tender . the eggplant was delicious and cooked soft but not mushy . try the fried bananas for dessert .
asian	we ordered a family combo # 2 with pork neck . everything tastes scrumptious and get the ice cream cookie at the end .
asian	attentive service , great sushi ! try the pork belly , it was a great addition to our dinner
asian	fish is fresh and rich . will definitely be coming back , i was blown away !
asian	( aaa rating ! ) we ordered a sea food hot rice stone , a bulgogi hot rice stone , and a seafood tofu hot soup . all three were so tasty and would 100 % order again . huge portions on the rice stones ! literally so full right now . great service and atmosphere at this place . definitely going back soon .
asian	my girlfriend is from wuhan china and she always brings me here when she misses home . great food but don 't expect the best service . but the prices are good and once they bring you the food you won 't care about the service . it 's just authentic and well prepared . try the cold dishes for an appetizer you won 't find anything like them anywhere else . they are fabulous !
asian	the steamed pork dumplings , eggplant with minced pork , beef in chili oil are my favorites . the service is friendly and fast .
asian	amazing & authentic curry dishes , you get enough food for two or three servings at a great price !
asian	would highly recommend the xiao long bao , dan dan noodles , braised beef noodle soup , and red bean pancakes to finish off . freshly made and great service - don 't be afraid to ask the waitresses or waiters if you aren 't too sure about the menu . come early to avoid lines though !
asian	incredible wine list and beers on tap . re-opened on 8 / 21 ... if you want great thai street food it is a must !
asian	friendly service . proud family owned and operated ! definitely a must try ! there lunch specials are very affordable but very filling .
asian	great service . this is my go to thai place in the city . love the drunk enough noodles and classic pad thai
asian	i highly recommend the buffet . friendly staff . definitely coming back .
asian	authentic , healthy and super tasty . i had the singapore vermicelli and pork belly and duck was shared at our table too . incredible flavor and they make their own sauces ! highly recommend this place but time your visits because its popular and busy around traditional lunch time so go early or later .
asian	impeccable service and you are in and out so quick at rush hour lunch time ! ! ! i will definitely be back . the pad thai is delicious and the pad ped in the delectable coconut milk is so creamy in my palate ! !
asian	i 'm part japanese so i know : ) i recently tried their lobster roll and it was delicious ! very reasonable for the price . i also like the roll with the scallop ( forgot the name ) and their mackerel ( saba ) appetizer . the sashimi is fresh and beautifully presented . the salads are yummy as well .
asian	could really experience the culture here ! pork cheek and galbi were delitful . cozy atmosphere , the long line up everyday did meet its exceptions . super worth . a must go again !
asian	the homemade tofu was to die for , best we 've had . sashimi is so fresh , had the kata age chicken & it was perfectly cooked . great finish with the yuzu sorbet . will definitely return , now must try their dinner ! !
asian	authentic japanese sushi chefs . we walk in to bob dylan overhead soon followed by the violent femmes food and service are all perfect !
asian	very reasonably priced with friendly service . it hit the spot after a day at the imperial spa across the street . really great flavors , and all the side dishes were delicious !
asian	been here several times this past year and the food is always good . you get a little bowl of soup and 3 or 5 ( lunch and dinner , respectively ) mini starters regardless of what you order . service is a tad brisk but fine . very small so it fills up quickly and there are often queues . delicious food , good prices , worth the possibility of a wait . they are closing temporarily from 23rd may to august or september so get it while you can !
asian	if you go before 6 you should be able to get a table for dinner in a timely fashion - after that , be prepared to wait outside when the line forms . great service , moderate prices and unreal flavor . one of the best khao soy 's i 've ever had ! ! ! fast service but all main dishes are made fresh so don 't expect to eat and leave in 20 minutes . the tom yum cesar was so delicious except the cold shrimp was a bit meh . 10 / 10 would go again
asian	if you don 't order ahead , there will be a wait because the place is always packed ! but don 't be discouraged , because it will be well worth the wait . the price is extremely well priced for the quantity and quality of the food ! must visit !
asian	don 't come here if you 're expecting your typical americanized chinese food , because they specialize in the typically spicy sichuan cooking . my personal favorites include the dry braised chicken with spicy sauce in hot pot ( under gan guo ) , the spicy shredded potato , ox tongue ( be adventurous ! it 's so good ) , and twice cooked pork . seriously the best real chinese food i 've had in madison . a real local treasure .
asian	the only issue i had was that the service was a little slow , but then again the restaurant is still very new and their great food makes up for it ! this has become my favourite place to go when i visit toronto .
asian	i had a red curry of some sort served in a pineapple . the contrasting spicy and sweet flavors from the curry and pineapple are unforgettable . also the king prawn served with basil and lemon grass were amazing . easily the best customer service i 've received during my trip to toronto . left a lasting impression ! 100 % recommend to anyone visiting toronto !
asian	authentic ! the best asain food in pittsburgh . the hot sauce dish is deliciously flavorful and actually spicy , unlike other places , if you order spicy it actually is and also not overpowering of the other flavors . the sushi is also amazing , fresh , and delicious . the homemade noodles are to die for ... i can 't eat lots me in or noodle soups anywhere else now . the staff are also friendly and patient with people new to authentic seszchuan food - you can trust their recommendations if you aren 't sure what to choose . overall , i would give this place a 10 out of 5 if i could ! !
asian	spoken from someone who lived in korea for a year , this places bulgoki is epic !
asian	i had the bun bo hue , spring rolls , pancakes and ice coffee . all exceptional but my favorites were the bbh and ice coffee ! would come again !
asian	a wonderful fresh meal ! i highly recommend coming here for a true quality meal .
asian	i love their rolls . the chao tom ( shrimp wrapped on sugar cane ) is especially delicious . what adds to the experience is the exceptional customer service . they were very attentive to all of my needs and accommodating to my child . i would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for vietnamese comfort food . !
asian	not to mention it 's very cheap ! love it ! i recommend the pho ... delicious ! it reminds me of the little restaurants that dot the streets in vietnam .
asian	just what we needed on our way out of vegas . the cure of cures . huge bowls of pho and delicious to the last drop . bahn mi sandwiches are super tasty and super cheap ! definitely worth a stop if youre in the area
asian	this is the only place so far that has great quality scallop sashimi and sweet shrimp sashimi . the fish was fresh , and they didn 't overload the sushi with rice . also check out the beef skewers- so delicious . only con is that it was crazy busy on saturday night--- make a reservation for sure ! we will definitely be back again !
asian	we 've been here three times in the last six months ! they always take care of us , and the fish is incredibly fresh ! the best part : they are open late !
asian	staff are wonderful , friendly and attentive . all our food came out so fast ! they always nail my favorite appetizer , dynamite . also , the monkey brain roll with deep fried banana was a lovely surprise , delicious combination of flavors .
asian	as the other reviews say they have a great ratio of fish to rice in the rolls . also alcohol is 2 for 1 so my mom and i each had a glass of wine and the total for that was $ 6 ( which in my opinion is a good price for one glass ) . we had nigiri , rolls , and a hand roll , the " batman burrito . "
asian	great flavor and great service . the sewer smell is very off putting , but after awhile you don 't notice it . the sushi makes up for the weird smell .
asian	it 's small and when busy you 'll either be waiting for a table or have to go to the sushi bar ( personally i prefer tavles ) . but the staff is very quick , rolls are made quick , over all very fast service which i appreciate . i 've done other ayce sushi in vegas and none have matched the speed of service this place offers . also the sushi is great . fresh ingredients , huge selection of rolls . now it 's my favorite sushi place in vegas .
asian	super fresh and tons of selection to keep your taste buds interested . definitely recommend for all of the hard core sushi buffs .
asian	for the price you pay , you get great sushi and bento box options . definitely going to be a top list for me !
asian	lovely decor , lovely service . will definitely be coming back .
asian	the bread really separates it from other sandwiches . the pho is delicious too and the service is great . the owner was very nice too .
asian	the bread was soft and fresh . for the noodles , the meat portions are quite generous as well ! i will definitely be back .
asian	love that your first visit you can get 50 % off your first alcoholic drink too ! i have been quiet often for lunch but have yet to try to weekends when it is open till 2am . i plan on trying it in the near future to how well their service and bartenders are . p.s pho here is delicious and their egg rolls .
asian	the selection includes everything you can imagine plus more .
asian	we had the gannam combo and it taste amazing ! ! for three people we had the two people combo and they gave us choices of white rice or hot stone bimbimbab . the oysters are fresh too ! marinated beef taste like heaven ! ! would definitely come back again ! ! ! !
asian	we kept coming back this is d best kbbq place for us ! update : we love this place . it 's our 8th time here and we never get disappointed . we love it here , the place , cleanliness , service , and of course dishes !
asian	prices are higher but definitely worth every penny . service could have been better but the food makes up for it . their congee is probably one of the tastiest in scarborough .
asian	i will definitely come here every time i visit vegas !
asian	certainly not like your chatime or coco or gongcha ! it 's like a starbucks bbt kind of feel ! i 've had a couple of the drinks and i would have to say my favorite is iron goddess and apple of my eye haha . i would like to try more drinks though as the name sounds interesting haha ! a tiny place though and definitely can get really really packed . plenty of parking though which is always a good thing and especially in this area ! definitely coming back here !
asian	it was everything i had hoped for and much more . i have been to many a korean bbq in los angeles and this one was the best one hands down i have ever been . service was very attentive . they tried in a very friendly way to get the bolgogi a little too quickly -- i hadn 't scraped out the crunchy delicious bits from the bottom of the bowl : ) the waiter and i had a good laugh over this and i quickly scraped the bottom and let him have the bowl .
asian	this place is has good seating and their service is excellent . the menu isn 't huge and that 's a good thing . you are here for the soup noodles . the hand made noodles taste great . give this place a try . i 'm sure you will love it .
asian	best place in the east valley for pho ! ! !
asian	been a long time since i had dumplings that good . we had the chicken and mushroom dumplings and the pork and chive dumplings . spiced just right , tender dumplings , and just the right amount of filling . can 't wait to try the sweet pork belly next time .
asian	the service is great and everything is made to order and comes put piping hot . delicious every time . i also recommend coming here after a few drinks . it can get very busy so be prepared to wait for your food a little bit . remember everything is made to order so it take some time when the small place gets full .
asian	super friendly staff and the sushi looked really yummy . will be wanting to come here again .
asian	best bang for your buck when it comes to sushi places around the area . if you 're ever in china town , stop by and don 't leave without trying " the shit , " it definitely lives up to its name ! : )
asian	best edamame i 've ever had . ate at the bar and the bartenders were great . sushi was fresh and full of flavor . recommend the potato roll
asian	best hot & sour soup i 've ever had ! ! we ordered the mongolian beer , garlic chicken with mixed veggies & moo mgoo gia oh pan . the lunch specials are great and a lot of food ! ! you also get a good serving of soup . ivy was our server and she was so sweet and great ! this place also delivers and it 's pretty kid friendly . would highly recommend it .
asian	best korean food i have ever had hands down ! the place is small but i have always managed to get a table . nice atmosphere ! highly recommended .
asian	did the omakase ( chef 's choice ) . 5 courses of delicious
asian	best pad thai i 've had in years . family had pad see ew and pumpkin curry and love both .
asian	we ordered the kung pao chicken , jakarta fried rice , vegetable egg roll and fried crabmeat rangoon , sweet and sour chicken
asian	best place for fresh poke and great customer service . my favorite is their spicy ahi & avocado poke and garlic poke . if you 're not sure or unfamiliar with a flavor , they will let you sample it . this place even sells a few hawaiian items - hawaiian sun drinks , shrimp chips , etc . i gave 4 out of 5 stars because there is no place to sit or stand to enjoy your delicious poke ! a counter with a couple bar stools in front could be a good idea since this place is tiny .
asian	best ramen in vegas ! i got the tonkatsu shoyu and it was amaze-balls ! ! definitely coming back to try the rest they have to offer !
asian	best recommendation we received when we traveled to toronto . can not recommend this place enough . our next trip north will be centralized around dinner here . be prepared for a lengthy , but worthwhile wait if you do not make a reservation . very affordable meals with average priced cocktails for toronto .
asian	amazing best soup i ever had amazing skewers best avocado shake i ever had so creamy amazing warm japanese cheese cake , i 'm not a big fan of pho but this was amazing and i would come back here only for pho so impressed found this place on yelp and very pleased the reviews were right : ) 5 / 5 best pho broth out there
asian	best sushi , best service ! they just need to open up the outside patio .
asian	best sushi i have had in nv by far for the price . the fat ass special roll , candy cane roll and garlic tuna sushi were all soooo tasty . great quality of fish . also they served us completely frozen mugs with our beer and that made such a difference in the kirin light . i would literally go back just to drink beer in glasses that cold . great restaurant !
asian	best sushi i have had in town ! ! they are amazing ! ! some of the freshest fish i have eaten , and the chefs know what they are doing , and love their jobs . would recommend to anyone that wants some good food ! !
asian	best sushi in all of vegas .. chef jon creates the most decadent food . since coming here and getting great service and awesome food i have not even tried another sushi home . chef jon is amazing to loyal custies . i 've been completely satisfied since coming here . thank you chef jon for always taking care of me when i come in .
asian	best sushi in scottsdale . jay the owner really takes pride in the quality if the fish . some of the best yellowtail i have had i. a long time . the mixed tempura a must ! !
asian	best sushi i 've had ever . loved doing half rice half zucchini tuna was amazing .
asian	best sushi i 've had in vegas so far . the ambiance was beautiful , service was very friendly & food was top notch . i ordered the katana roll which was my favorite , the lobster roll was really great as well . and the toro ? best toro i 've ever had . my mouth starts watering even thinking about it now ! & the great thing was , my boyfriend , who hates seafood , ordered the ji dori chicken & loved it . if you 're looking for a top notch sushi dinner with a romantic setting & nice view of the strip , this is the spot !
asian	best thai food ! delicious and fresh green curry . unique and delicious brown rice .
asian	best thai food ever ! ! excellent service and reasonable prices . well worth the trip off the strip to eat at this gem !
asian	best thai food in mississauga . affordable with large portions too .
asian	best thai in henderson . they cater to all eating habits such as gluten free , pescatarian , vegetarian , even vegan ! they have a little chart i noticed by the register so that they know when you call in . spring rolls are very flavored . pad thai is the best .
asian	best vegan place ever ! ! soooooooo goooooood i want to cry wth when the meat substitute too good ... uyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
asian	best vietnamese in the city . sushi is damn good too . service is wonderful , everyone there are super nice . so far nobody i have recommended this place to has only eaten there once . its marvelous .
asian	better than grandma made and she cooked traditional korean food for me growing up . i want to come here everyday . happy hour is totally worth it
asian	better than hawaii and julie the manager was fantastic ! she even held our 7 month old son so we could eat for a min ! we will be back ! take all of our money ! ! ! !
asian	better than panda . great customer service ! amazing food . clean restaurant ! we will definitely be back .
asian	we have been there twice and every dish was out of this world . not one bad dish among many ordered . some portions could be a little larger like the duck sliders which melt in your mouth but only 2 per serving . go with people who love to share their food so you can enjoy the full experience of fusion dining . don 't be in a hurry , some dishes take a while but well worth the wait . for sure try the korean street tacos ! ! !
asian	we had the asian falafel wrap and the special ( chicken katsu curry ) . they make their own chips and all food in-house ! the thai tea and vietnamese coffee are delic ! can 't wait to come back and try more .
asian	i order there combo sashimi and then some rolls thinking they would be small and simple . nope : ) the sashimi had huge chungs of fresh fish ready for me to attack . great service and awesome food . 5 / 5 .
asian	very nice place . chef was friendly . will come again to try new things .
asian	both food and service is great ! takoyaki takes some time to make ( ~ 20mins ) but i order it almost every time ! definitely worth it ! their udon is very tasty too and filling ! i tried a majority of the things there and love it ! surprisingly i like their tofu nuggets , cause i 'm not a fan of fried tofu but it 's really good cheap and tasty food + friendly service !
asian	the fish is so fresh and melts in your mouth like butter . a perfect healthy fast food option ! i am addicted
asian	brand new restaurant brand new concept that works ! got a spicy tuna burrito with soy paper threw some seaweed salad and jalapeños in it and was in heaven . talked to the chef and he said they are opening 4 more in vegas and will be going nation wide soon . definitely recommend this place . price are great too .
asian	i always ask for items not on the menu and 99 % of the time its not a problem . even when busy my coffee keeps getting refilled . service is prompt and polite . i don 't like that i always have to ask for water , it should be brought right away , but when i ask , they gladly bring it . be hungry when you go as the portions are not massive , but very generous !
asian	a lot of care goes into the preparation of their food . my favourite vietnamese restaurant !
asian	everything was fresh and tasty . the service was quick and the staff was friendly . parking was easy and plenty of it to go around . we had the chicken pho and the large was really big . it could have been split between two people easily . the spring rolls and peanut sauce was also delicious . the restaurant was clean as well , which just made the experience that much more enjoyable . we 'll be back next time we come through vegas .
asian	brought my wife here for her birthday dinner and we both had a great time . food was delicious . put us both on a good comma . second time we come here and both times have been amazing . it 's a bit pricy , but worth every penny .
asian	we had such a great relaxing brunch here this is our favorite place . the atmosphere is great with the indoor-outdoor dining . they even have a tree inside . the food well i can 't say enough ! ! it 's the best . we started with the spicy tuna roll . it was topped with deep fried shrimp ! you must try the green tea waffles sooooo yummy . i had the adobo shrimp , avocado and crab salad . it also was so refreshing . oh yes and the coconut martini definitely a must ! you can 't go wrong with anything on this menu .
asian	the best in las vegas . don 't miss the seafood expertly prepared . pretty pricey but well worth the $ $ $
asian	spinach and bread amazing too . a sweet ending with the rice pudding with a nice touch of ginger . the customer service is pretty good and the place looks clean and pretty . we will come back for sure !
asian	great staff ! everyone was so friendly and efficient ! after being denied entrance for lack of dress code at the flamingos buffet my boyfriend and i decided to check out flavors buffet and it was well worth it .
asian	large enough to cater to the needs of vegan , vegetarian and non-vegs . the specials are the best ! : )
asian	had something for everyone . or if you just wanted to sample a bunch of different cuisines . dishes that stood out were the kung pow chicken it was spicy and so good . also the beef brisket was smoked with the right amount of flavor . can 't say i disliked anything and we tried almost everything . worth the $ 60 a person price tag . and i am frugal and don 't say that often . oh and the dessert buffet was so amazing ! ! !
asian	a description is tagged so you know what to expect . vegan , gluten free , no sugar- any food you may want . huge array of meat , vegetables , appetizers , desserts , soup and sushi . the list goes on and on ! sebrine was my server- what a delight the decor is intriguing also . i will definitely be back !
asian	most indian buffets i 've been to are fairly small and feature ok food , but the selection here is not only bigger , but also much tastier and an excellent value for the quality and price they charged . the crisp bread , a fried spongy dessert , and several of the curries were among my favorites , along with a refreshing drink at the buffet with spices in it . the waiter also gave us complimentary naan and dosa .
asian	service was stellar . it was our first time , so the owner walked us through everything on the buffet . fantastic mango lassi
asian	always hot and fresh choices . i highly recommend giving this place a try .
asian	friendly and accommodating so staff . great dining experience ​ all the way around !
asian	family also had dak bulgogi , spicy pork bulgogi , japchase - all absolutely delicious ! ! atmosphere was awesome too !
asian	the wonton chips are a tad too salty but i can eat this all day , all night .
asian	this place has the best vietnamese food i 've ever had. granted , i 've only been to 4 vietnamese places in my life , but wow , i 'm coming back !
asian	miyagi-san burger was an excellent choice . oxtail fries as an appetizer and you will not be disappointed .
asian	i love that i can create my own roll . i made one with filet mignon and another with shrimp tempura ! great service !
asian	i got the miyagi burger and the bachi fish . come here to get food ! i definitely recommend ! will definitely come again .
asian	i had the kiki burger and it was the best tasting burger i 've had in my whole life . the service was excellent . i drove from arizona , over 90 miles to eat at bachi burger and it was worth every mile !
asian	the meat is excellent whether you get beef , salmon or whatever . i was really happy with the food . but the waiter wouldn 't refill our drinks fast enough . i suppose it was too packed to expect otherwise . check this place out if you 're at new york new york .
asian	the deco is very cool and the stuffs are kind . always go with my girlfriend .
asian	i had the matcha latte and immediately regretted the whole thing because i couldn 't taste the sugar .
asian	i have eaten the samosas , chilli chicken , chicken curry , fish pakora , vegetable pakora , tandoori chicken leg , basmati rice , freshly hand made naan breads . the dipping sauce with samosas is a tamarind sauce and the other one is a green sauce very interesting herbal flavour and spice . as a chef i can tell its home made and made with love . i always go to " dev " and when you pick up your food you get 10 % off and i usually call in my order and when i get there its all nicely packages and ready in a box . amazing place !
asian	would do it again but take the the chefs menu instead .
asian	so friendly and sweet . food was so flavorful and delicious as well . definitely coming back ! ! ! ! ! !
asian	it was my first time here , i had the japanese crepe , green tea crepe cake and khao san road ice icream . i know , im a pig * oink * but seriously that cake makes me look a other cakes differently , i cant eat cakes from anywhere else anymore .... : , ( they all suck now . we told the staff it was our first time here and they were excited for us . they helped us with our order . ill differently come back for that one slice of heaven .
asian	thanks the guy working the sushi bar is great !
asian	came here with the boyfriend and had the duck salad , spicy prawn , black pepper merlot beef , hakka noodles and the perrier joulet rose . delicious . we finished with the chocolate dumplings for dessert . i highly recommend and will definitely be back .
asian	food was truly outstanding . unfortunately , service is sparse at best especially if you don 't speak cantonese . sad as total customer experience could be significantly improved with better service and attitude . go there for the food . forget service so you won 't be disappointed .
asian	very impressive . carts were consistent and had much variety . best cart style dim-sum i 've found in the city core . the only downside for me , which isn 't a big deal , is that it is not meant for one as many of the dishes are family sizes , although not all . limited my selection a bit but outside of that , great for couples and family .
asian	the staff is always prompt , the food delicious and the atmosphere is perfect for a date . my family and i have gone to this restaurant for years and never had a bad meal . if something was ever wrong with the food they ( appeared ) happy to fix it . the only negative is they only have one or two tables that seat more the four comfortably .
asian	the line up and limit per person is stupid . get more ovens or get more space .
asian	they answered all my questions . staff quick and they know there sushi . the only other sushi place i have been to is umiya but i know this place is right up there with them . i will deff be coming back .
asian	love every dish ! ! my husband and i ordered the $ 80 menu , and it 's plenty of food ! love all the diff tuna in diff prep , esp the tuna hand roll and the medium fatty tuna . they just melt in ur mouth ! ! we were lucky to sit at the sushi bar and saw all the beautiful work done by the chef group ! ! got a plum wine sorbet as my dessert and man it was soooo awesome ! ! highly recommended ! !
asian	fast , friendly . great food , bit pricey . i think this was roger ebert 's favourite toronto restaurant ... i think ...
asian	i tried a few items on their menu this weekend and they were all delicious . the service was fast and lisa was an absolute joy to talk with . if you are ever in the area i highly recommend the curry rice and the refreshing mango salad .
asian	freshly made chicken and ribs on charcoal fire ! super delicious food and great owners ! definitely recommended and going back again ! they accept delivery as well
asian	pork pad kea mow was outstanding , spring rolls the freshest ever ! great value and very fresh food . cute restaurant with friendly staff . the best thai in las vegas .
asian	i have tried other places and can 't find anything like it . this is the only chinese food i will eat . we drive from maricopa to get it .
asian	first time here and was very pleased with the food and service . definitely be coming back .
asian	soy garlic was definitely my favourite . the spicy chicken is great too but the spiciness really builds up so eat with caution xd . go for the beer combo if having beer at the same time . very speedy service ; )
asian	the spicy ones are probably the best ones , just a bit of kick into it . reminds me of my days back in okpo eating this ones in a-bit-strange restaurants . thank you guys ! keep up the good work !
asian	everything else is average and i would suggest staying away from the always overcooked lo mein .
asian	the place is kinda hard to find its inside a nail salon . he is starting a food truck in addition the store soon . i would highly recommend trying this place . $ 10 dollars for 3 buns and a drink great value .
asian	a bit pricey but hey- we are on the strip in las vegas , of course prices will be a tad bit higher than usual . i love their womton noodle soup and their chicken. good place to eat after gambling
asian	service is amazing . this place is always busy and never had a bad experience . highly recommend .
asian	best around . won 't go anywhere but peking house . the woman that runs the place is very courteous and makes sure you are happy with your food .
asian	to order : juicy pork buns , pot stickers , and the beef and pork pie !
asian	my friend and i have to go every couple of months . we are usually seated right away . despite the staff not really being able to speak english or us chinese , we can communicate just fine and they are always accommodating . the green bean dish is a favourite . good amount of food for the price as well . we 've always left with leftovers .
asian	gary did it again with this location and we love coming in to watch sports on a saturday afternoon . best chinese in az !
asian	fabulous service and very quick to bring fresh hot delicious food out to us . serves are very nice , clean restaurant with great ambiance .
asian	sushi is fresh - atmosphere is clean and upscale . we will eat here again for sure . tkx .
asian	great staff friendly service . me and my girlfriend usually get the kung pao chicken and the mongolian beef . you can 't go wrong with those two staple dishes . the wonton soup and the pot stickers are great appetizers . go check it out !
asian	try the surfer roll . it 's amazing . hit up happy hour for a great selection of discounted rolls , drinks & apps .
asian	decided to try out the new chinese place in town and we could not be more satisfied . the egg roll was crunchy and flaky and full of fresh vegetables . the ma po tofu was so flavorful and again full of fresh veggies . portions are generous and easy to share . staff is friendly . location is clean . menu is extensive and easy to make vegan / vegetarian friendly . this is definitely going to be one of our new go to restaurants .
asian	clean , quiet , and the best chinese food in town . i 'm always so surprised they don 't have more customers . i think it 's because the exterior looks so small and non-descript from the outside . once you walk into their dining area the ambiance is impressive . if you haven 't tried it , you should . the west valley 's best kept secret .
asian	clean restaurant , great food and service ! i would say we are definitely foodies and this place was delish ! ! try the moon china chicken ! lot 's of fresh veggies , flavorful sauce and lightly crisped chicken ! !
asian	clever koi never ceases to amaze me . sit at the bar and ask the bartenders what to order - you can 't go wrong with the chow mein , last time i added shrimp and it was enough food for three meals . don 't miss the pork belly steamed bun , get one to start your meal and for dessert ! love the crispy pineapple duck . oh and the cocktails ... this place rocks . one of the best restaurants in az .
asian	we get to see tiesto this weekend ! lines get crazy long but security is extremely nice and accommodating and will escort you to the front especially if you 're a group of girls ! a little over crowded for my liking but i love the fact that 's there 's two options for music . a lot of the clubs in vegas are edm only , don 't get me wrong i love love djs like tiesto kaskade and calvin harris but sometimes you just wanna dance to some snoop and dre or biggie and this club offers both . very good looking crowd and great space for dancing . will be back !
asian	an amazing light desert i almost eat everyday now ! ! addicted ! it 's like $ 2 . also their spring rolls are incredible ! ! ! a hidden gem in scottsdale . don 't miss out . fun atmosphere as well ! ! ! there hours are not right tho ! they are open till 10pm on friday and saturday !
asian	love their curry and they have real fresh flowers at each table ! super great food .
asian	shingen roll cake tasted so good with red bean and mochi inside ! best $ 3.75 i could spend . : )
asian	come here least once a week for about a month now we have been to at least 6 other spots in the valley & this is our new favorite . they 're so polite they greet you as soon as that door opens . they are constantly filling your water making sure you have what you need . the customer service makes the whole experience a hundred times better .
asian	much better than our hotel would have offered . servers were nice and pleasant . food delivery was quick which helps when on a schedule.give thus place a try , you will not be dissatisfied !
asian	i always come back ! great price for how much you get .
asian	amazing concept and food .. if you dont like it , it is pretty much your fault for lack of picking what you like .. everything down from sauce to dry seasoning to add ons are all your choice .. i loaded up with meats and veggies with fried rice and was stuffed .. pricey by some standards but its a ton of food , well worth it
asian	not good or picky eaters who may not like the cuisine. bibimbop was great although they skimped on sauce and toppings and added a lot of rice . great for small bites
asian	glad i came across this place and can 't wait to come again .
asian	their chicken and shrimp fried rice is also very good and the prices here are very affordable . i go here almost all the time .
asian	huge bowl of ramen noodles under 9 $ . try the potatoe deep fried side dish mmm great in the winter . open late
asian	they have been the short schedule dinner saver on many occasions . it 's not five-star food but it 's pretty good
asian	a rare find here in las vegas , an even rarer find in the usa . well worth the effort .
asian	amazing service . amazing food . if u want that hibachi fix go here . not a big place bit that makes it like a small walk in hole in the wall kinda place .
asian	the food was fresh and tasty and i live all the way in toronto so you know it 's good
asian	cool concept . you choose your ingredients and then to the oven ! fast and good . been here two times and will keep coming back .
asian	cool vibe ..... if you 're tired of the same old sushi , obon is a true delight . great service from our hostess ashley and server jessica . i 'm a cosmo snob and i had one of the best ever ! don 't miss out on the dessert , you 'll regret it ! !
asian	do yourself a favour and check this restaurant out you won 't regreat it .
asian	such thin wrapping and flavorful soup inside each one . $ 8 gets you 6 dumplings . had the turnip cake and that was served hot and crispy . shorter wait if you don 't mind sharing a table with others .
asian	amazing crab paste soup , chicken wings , and rare beef plate
asian	we both got shrimp dishes , everything was really good . we both ordered pork fried rice and it was very tasty ! egg rolls with hot mustard , yum ! the mustard was amazing . we live in ca and were visiting family in cleveland ( funeral ) but we will go back . parking was okay / we got lucky to find a spot out front , but neighborhood isn 't upscale : - ) food was delicious and service was above average . i 'm a happy camper and super full !
asian	they offer numerous dinner date specials and happy hour deals . the orange chicken was kind of bland but everything else was great !
asian	unique sauce or traditional . combo with a light side salad - great place if you feeling katsu .
asian	tien is very good server he spoile me every time . of course we meet again hahaha thank you guys : )
asian	we have eaten here several times and keep coming back for more . great prices , substantial portions and flavor that delights the tastebuds !
asian	find out what you 're getting into before you go . maybe not for everyone , but if you like an adventure and don 't mind paying for the occasional extravagance ( anniversary ? yes . ) this should be on the list . shinbay chefs are artists , and food is their medium . what is available to eat is entirely up to them , and varies from visit to visit . each course you are served is another step in a journey of taste . we 're working on finding a worthy " excuse " to go back as soon as possible .
asian	i love the yellow curry and my fiance always gets the red curry . we also love the beef jerky which is a good portion size and also very tasty . we get takeout from gaati probably once a week and the food is consistently yummy !
asian	the pepper chicken wings were great . shrimp fried wonton was hot and fresh . nice big juicy steak on the new menu was done perfectly . all this under $ 25 ... aaaa-freaking-mazing !
asian	staff is very attentive , and all of the food cooked fresh to order . they do give you options on your spiciness level desired , i 'm a wimp and do 1 . my husband does a 7 , and he loves the bracing kick it has . all of the fried foods are perfectly done , juicy when appropriate . the sauce is the best part of the meal , hearty and ultra flavorful . my fave place to eat in vegas !
asian	excellent price . i had the chicken katsu and vegetable curry . superb ! warning : these guys are not messing around on the spicy levels . they go from 1 to 10 . a level 4 is already blistering spicy . i made the mistake of ordering a 5 the first time i came . then i went to a 3 the 2nd time and it was just right . watch out ... these guys make hellish spicy curry . love this place . will come back for sure .
asian	beef was a little tough but , it 's curry it over cooks easily . a little on the sweeter side but it 's delicious , great service from the waitress . looks like a relatively new restaurant . nice , clean & airy .
asian	i 've been on a spicy food kick so to satisfy a craving , i came here on the recommendation by google and i was not disappointed ! perfectly cooked rice , curry , and cheese naan . the food was amazing , that staff was great , and the atmosphere was soft and relaxing . definitely a must try .
asian	coming to this place reminded me how good japanese curry is . i 'd definitely come here again . i 'd recommend the chicken cutlet curry with cheese . the owner is from tokyo and he cooks authentic japanese curry . i spent around $ 8 for the curry which is a good deal in my opinion . the only down side is lack of toppings . i would 've loved scrambled eggs in my curry . also the spice levels should be fixed . i got the regular spice and it seemed like it was just mild . other than that i had a good time .
asian	i went for lunch and was very impressed . they have a huge selection vegetarian and not and all priced very well . i got the red curry chicken with a thai egg roll , rice and fried wonton for $ 6.95 what a steal . you can get as hot as you like which i like a lot of spice in my life and they delivered . i will be back for sure in the near future and i am kicking myself for taking this long to try it . also after reading reviews i saw the service was bad and i had no issues with service they were very prompt and even refilled my soda without even having to ask .
asian	my friend and i came during lunch and the service was exceptional . you have to have thw chicken curry and the thai sliders . the edemame is fresh and flavorful . definitely a must try of you like affordable thai food .
asian	really enjoy the spiciness level of the regular curry , though my wife prefers the mild . i 'm a big fan of adding vegetables to the meals and the best way to do this price wise is to order the vegetable curry and add a chicken or pork cutlet to it .
asian	katsu was crispy and went really well with the curry sauce . rice cooked well and side of coleslaw was nice . the gentlemen and lady working were so friendly and even by to the food court to ask how everything was ! amazing restaurant service right in a food court . this place is a hard to find and not many other places are open around it but there was plenty of seating and less than a 4 min walk from yonge and college so it 's worth the trip !
asian	the husband and i love this place . it 's great to order online through yelp and pick up down the street from my office .
asian	and amazing food . i was very hesitant at first because i don 't like chinese food that much , but the food here is wonderful ! and the server was super sweet and very understand because i was confused as to what i wanted . i definitely give this place a five star !
asian	the prices are reasonable and the amount of food given is well worth it . the place well maintained too . definitely have to go back .
asian	staffs were super friendly . place was clean . food was amazing and fresh . also gave us a lot of complimentary dishes ! one of the best sushi places that i 've been to . will return again !
asian	they truly went above and beyond .. the yellowtail appetizer is amazing , we ordered two ..
asian	we went a few months ago and loved it . employees are always in a positive mood and the sushi tastes so satisfying . we are going tonight again .
asian	my partner had the kottri and i let him try a spoonful of mine and his face lit up - he thought mine was more tasty ! will definitely be coming back ! one teensy thing is that i wish the noodles were firmer / springier ( like the momofuku ones mmmm )
asian	i brought my family here from canada and they loved everything about this restaurant . the staff is very friendly , the food comes out all in perfect time , and the quality and taste is fabulous ! tonight my boyfriend and i enjoyed another supper and i had to write this review based on the consistency of my chosen star level ... if there was a 10 rating i would of choose it !
asian	even better service than the roy 's in maui , if that is even possible . our family loves roy 's . it 's one of our favorite restaurants and the location in las vegas was no exception . food was delicious , hot and fresh . service was outstanding . drink ninja was in full effect . thanks roy 's for another amazing dinner !
asian	felt like we were taken care of once we walked in . they asked us if we wanted refills on rice or sides . food was good . we ordered kalbi and soondobu and combo platter and it was enough food for three of us .
asian	i felt like the woman at the counter was only worried about me and what i needed when in actuality she was treating all of her other customers so well . the place was very clean and very nice . food was great . i made a special request for sesame beef that is not on the menu , it was great . not as sweet at i like , but seasoned well and tasted great . it seemed slightly high because i am used to paying $ 8- $ 10 for an entrée , but i paid $ 14 . not complaining , just saying and i fully understand because it was a special request and i was not disappointed . i absolutely recommend !
asian	i got the teriyaki chicken w / rice lunch special . they had it ready for me to pickup in 15 minutes . it was great and high quality . i 'll definitely be returning .
asian	customer service is wonderful , a nice mom and pop place to go support. i 'm so happy they opened a vietnamese food place nearby where i live : )
asian	i 've never been to a business where everyone thanks you when leaving . best sushi i 've experienced thus far ! it 's been 2 days since i 've discovered them and 2 days i 've happily eaten " deliciousness " ! ! !
asian	my father in law was recently diagnosed with a secondary cancer . luckily we found a match and had a stem cell transplant . problem is , he hass the immunity of a newborn and we have a checklist of safety measures . this was the only restaurant willing to go the extra mile preparing & cooking his food . as well as sitting us separately from the rest of the restaurant . will definitely be back ! thanks again !
asian	my husband and i told them it was our anniversary and not only did they send over a compimentary bottle of champagne , but the sushi chef came out and introduced himself and asked if he could prepare a special 5- course meal for us ! ? this is very uncommon these days and we were beyond happy ! we ended up staying there for almost 3 1 / 2 hours ! wonderful wonderful ! food was fantastic as well !
asian	never an empty or even half empty cup . super patient and let us customize everything with no attitude and even assisted . solid food and quick !
asian	freshly made and beyond great presentation . if your thinking about trying i definitely suggest you do . the restrooms are clean as well
asian	the food was amazing and fresh , they even know my order ! the teas are refreshing ! and the owner is awsome ! ! !
asian	the owner was so nice and helpful when ordering . the noodles were so good and the mac salad ! definitely wi be coming back again
asian	if you order spicy food try the peppershrimp its sooo gooodd and affrodable
asian	they are really attentive to see if you need anything else . there food is delicious , recommend the chicken pad thai / chicken fried rice & tom yum sea food soup its amazing . overall great quality in food
asian	they were more than happy to help veganize our meals . the ingredients looked and tasted really fresh .
asian	very friendly and extremely clean . the portion sizes were a lot bigger than i expected , which was great aha ! the best part is that they also offer healthy substitutes such as , brown rice instead of white rice . i would definitely recommend this place to everyone !
asian	i had the boiled vegetables and it had a ton of spice ! the won ton soup was delicious as well . i will come back here
asian	daniel made a special roll for us . exactly what we were looking for , with seared blackened tuna , cucumber and other awesome flavors ! ! ! so good ! ! ! had appetizers , soup , rolls and dessert .
asian	soup noodles are $ 8.49 ( original ) to $ 8.99 ( tomato , spicy ) . you get a vat of boiling soup broth , with noodles on the side and the toppings laid out beautifully on a tray . you can 't choose the toppings but they were plentiful : quail egg , 1 shrimp , 1 fish tofu , ham , meat sauce , fresh bean curd , chinese fungus , corn , mushroom , veggies , 3 slices of meat . i love these lai fun noodles , these are hard to find and they are my favouite ! the original broth was flavourful , not too salty . we didn 't order any appetizers as they looked small .
asian	nigiri is double portion size than anywhere else with 1 / 2 the rice . blown away at speed and efficiency of staff . highly recommended !
asian	lunch $ 20 ayce . order off the menu . fast ! really good ! if i lived in vegas i would eat here all the time .
asian	japanese alcohol and specialty sushi . great place , first time here and i am in love .
asian	decided to try this place out based on yelp reviews . yelpers were spot on , this place did not disappoint . we ordered an appetizer and several rolls . everything was so fresh and flavorful making it hard to pick a favorite . oh wait did i mention the wait staff ? ? ? incredibly friendly and very prompt , we never had to ask for a thing ! this is now our new go-to sushi spot .
asian	it is the same price as but has much more selections ( both sushi and non-sushi ) than other all-you-can-eat sushi places . a good place for big groups too because it 's very roomy .
asian	i recommend wearing pants or bringing a sweater bevcause they keep it cool in the summer . they offer authentic chinese dishes off the menu .. if you know of a dish it doesnt hurt to ask if they can make it for you : ) .... also the sishi is amazing . the best in the city ... they use high quality ingredients and their sushi guys are trained in newyork and asia .... try the natruto roll for a low carb option or thr steamed salmon with broccoli ! !
asian	my friend and i both agreed better mandarin . the golden shrimp was proper and the peking duck was succulent .
asian	amazing decor try the entire menu don 't forget yak meat
asian	atmosphere is nice and comfortable , feels like home . must try
asian	definitely recommend this place ! ! ! the calamari is phenomenal and the sushi rolls are amazing ! ! the people are very nice and service is great !
asian	sea food is so good the people that work there are so nice and the price is good as well . can 't say nothing bad about this place .
asian	definitely worth all the stars ! i did the " create your own " poke bowl . fresh selection of fish , great sauces , excellent customer service . i will definitely be returning ! i even got a free bag of taro chips since it was their first week being open .
asian	delicious and fresh . i love this place -- and can definitely see how people can get addicted tot his fresh lifestyle . whether you choose the menu bowls or create your own : it 's just so enjoyable .
asian	unique concept of no menu , and pay what you can . they keep serving you dishes until you 're full . different food each time you go back . the staff are extremely friendly too . highly recommend this restaurant
asian	delicious food ! ! great quantity ! ! best thai food ever had ! ! must try ! ! beautiful ambiance , not typically like in other thai restaurants ! !
asian	i loved the portions . i had a regular pho the first time i came and a curry pho the secone time . both are very delicious ! the interior is great too ! it 's quite nice
asian	delicious . i eat way too much of it ! they have shiner bock on tap , which is another plus . yes , it 's a wait , so go with a group of friends and order some pitchers while you wait . or get take-out or delivery if you don 't have time to be social . but don 't miss the goodness .
asian	it 's super filling , and the teriyaki sauce is the best i 've had here in las vegas .
asian	amazing , delicious , interesting food with recipes that they create themselves , and the owner was attentive to us and super friendly .. going back often .
asian	delicious pork dumplings and love the hot chick ! chicken wing special on thursday is very good and nice variety of flavors . the spicy green beans are addicting , yum !
asian	service is fast - as in ' breakneck speed fast ' ... a bit difficult to relax but if you 're eating before a movie you 'll for sure make it on time ! this is a small place . i 'd love to just order a large verson of the dinner salad , it 's delicious . next trip we 'll go w / friends and order that huge gondola of sushi . have been there twice so far , no complaints . haven 't tried the hibachi rooms yet .
asian	i 've been ordering the dinner for two for over 3 years now , and i haven 't found a better place yet . i usually sub the chop suey for lo mein - it 's a couple bucks more but totally worth it . the portion sizes are great , they usually can 't even close the box for the chicken balls and wings ! if you 're a fan of fresh canadian chinese food and you 're looking for a solid place to order in , look no further .
asian	only thing ... don 't order online . they charge a delivery fee if you do ( not matter what the amount ) . call instead ...
asian	deserves every star ! the food is truly delicious . every single recommendation was fabulous .
asian	do yourself a favor and try everything . you never know what may become your new favorite item .
asian	during lunch they bring the cart around to the table and you can choose off that or their full menu . a must eat in vegas ! !
asian	also quite affordable ; we ate like kings and walked out of there with $ 16 ea. in damages . worth every penny and more !
asian	i 've been to toronto twice and came here both times . the dim sum was so fresh and delicious . it was big portion too compared to nyc dim sum . they have this fried shrimp . a must try ! ( * * * * ) come here early because it can get really busy .
asian	meat and noodle dishes aren 't spectacular and are a tad overpriced . the mango pudding is a must .
asian	" have passed by this place on spadina a few doors north of dundas more times than i can count . i am so glad a pal o ' mine reccomended it and we went today with a group of friends . food , service & price superb !
asian	we 've been waiting to try this place and we weren 't disappointed at all , totally worth it .
asian	i would give them 10 stars . chef prepared the most delicious selections and the service was 2nd to none . i recommend this place to anyone
asian	a unique and hard to come by selection of incredibly fresh seafood . definitely a bucket list destination .
asian	i regret to say we did come in christmas night , however , the staff was still awesome and welcoming . our server was simba ... asian simba ( his words , not mine ) . he was great ! he was getting slammed all over the place but made sure to keep coming by us to see if we were doing good . you can tell he really cares about the people , we appreciate that ! food was incredible ! ! ! will definitely be coming back . well worth the price , only $ 23.95 ayce ... seriously they could charge $ 35 and i 'd still come ...
asian	got a kiwi watermelon slushie , a cucumber spicy salad and some dumplings . soooo good ! go eat here now ! : d
asian	amazing dinner. better than nobu and much better priced. need to make reservations in advance. highly recommended
asian	the yellow tail sashimi was mind blowing . thai beef cups & the rolls we had ( don 't recall which ones ) were delicious . waitress was fantastic & the place is beautiful inside . i highly recommend visiting the social house .
asian	i 'm going back to try the lunch buffet soon .
asian	we love going to roy 's all over . it was our first time at this location and we were treated like we owned the place . outstanding ! ! !
asian	the sushi was so fresh . probably the freshest yellowtail sashimi i have had in years . they have some signature drinks to test out . the katsuya fresh which is a cucumber refreshing treat . barely sweet but amazing ! the tempura as an appetizer was delicate and light . we had some wimpy california rolls with snow crab and they were also phenomenal . love this place !
asian	we were promptly seated at the bar and got served very fast . we started with their sambal edamame - and , believe me , when even your edamame is outstanding , you are in the right track . we weren 't really hungry , just wanted some munchies , and the tapas were delicious and the right order for the kind of night . i would strongly recommend their sashimi slaw - so many flavours and scents i can 't describe in a review , you have to try it yourself , and can be made vegetarian as i have been told . the bartender was extremely nice and i have to go back there just to try his cocktails - they all look incredible .
asian	amazing dish clean and amazing cook and people in there very nice cozy place if i can put 8 or more stars i will : )
asian	my first time trying the rad nah dish , and absolutely fell in love . the gravy was all too perfect , and the flat noodles in the dish were done to perfection . along with rad nah , i had their summer rolls without shrimp , which really got me ready for the main meals . definitely coming back here soon .
asian	you can really tell when they take careful precision into each beautiful dish . the people really take care of you , and they don 't rush you . my visit there was awesome , the food was delicious , the service is on point-despite them being very busy at the time . the place was so busy , we were seated on the other side of the restaurant . very quiet , good for eating , and i was able to have a good time with my family .
asian	amazing dizi , the only one in toronto and gta. family friendly. very good service. very clean. i have no compliants about this place. i would definitely recommend it and go there again .
asian	i 've been eating this for the last 10 years . fast , cheap , and delicious . customer service is not that good but the food is too good but if you 're someone that the customer service affects . then it would be a 4 star .
asian	do not hesitate ! ! out of this world ! ! very cheap for the amazing quality of food . it 's mine and my fiancé 's new favourite restaurant . just go now ! ! you will not regret it : )
asian	do not let the appearance and location throw you off ! this is by far the best thai food i have found in northeast ohio . the chef has been making amazing dishes for over 30 years . a must try for thai food enthusiasts .
asian	extremely creative dishes with enough food that you can avoid picking up a on the way home . favorite cold dish had a green dressing wish avocado and cucumber . our server elizabeth was highly knowledgeable and paid close attention to when we were finished with one dish so she could deliver the next . we never doubled up our waited too long to eat .
asian	do the food journey , trust your waiter to make selections and you will not be disappointed . loved our experience ! !
asian	the ' oh my god ' roll is tasty and served in an interesting way . order and find out !
asian	do your self a favor by going there before you complete reading this review . this place is totally worth the hype ! we got the lemongrass tofu taco and steamed tofu buns ! get the extra side of the hot sauce and you are all set ! the servers are friendly as well . the steamed buns certinaly make it to the list of last meal requests ; )
asian	the price is a little higher than other places but i would recommend this place if you have the funds for your tongue !
asian	dragonfly noodles with chicken , pho with beef , las vegas roll and flaming tuna roll . all exceptional . service was amazing and quick . place was also very clean .
asian	always treat me like family ! long live the king of sushi jjanga ! keep on building your empire and raising the bar in the sushi business
asian	their garden milk tea is so cute ... probably my favourite drink off their menu . my friend always gets the alley trio and loves it too . half sugar and less ice is how we usually get it and it is just the right amount of sweetness . i 've only had one incident where something was wrong and they were nice enough to replace my drink asap . 5 stars !
asian	service is fast , a tiny bit pricey , but i say worth it ! ! their thai tea is fantastic , phad thai is delish ! and they don 't skimp on the spicy ! ! love this place , have gone back , and will go back time after time !
asian	prices are good , quality is very good . friendly staff , food is cooked fresh . the orders come out correct , even when custom. thanks chef kenny for another awesome place to eat !
asian	service could be a bit better but the food makes up so much more ! : )
asian	you can get a combo of 3 so that gives you a chance to try multiple varieties . we tried the fried and steamed versions along with the green onion pancake . they had 2 vegetarian options - spinach / mushroom and mixed vegetables . the fried spinach / mushroom dumplings were my favorite ! very crunchy and fresh . you can watch them make the dumplings at the front of the restaurant . the steamed dumplings were very good too . the green onion pancake had a lot of dough so wasn 't really that good . living in the bay area i thought i 've had good dumplings before but these ones really blew my mind .
asian	try the affordable appetizers too ! this is one of my favorite restaurants in montreal .
asian	the standard if there ever was one . delicious . minus a point for the hole in the wall atmosphere , which was rough and unclean , even for chinatown standards .
asian	thin chewy dough and juicy filling . all made to order that is fresh and hot ! ! you can get 14 dumplings for cheap as $ 4.99 . i love the hot and sour soup too. not too spicy and not too sour .
asian	this is a tiny place , but the food they serve is really , really good . i didn 't like their appetizers that much , but their dumplings are great . there wasn 't much about this place that i didn 't like .
asian	we had the steamed pork and cabbage dumpling and fried lamb and onion dumpling . they were both delicious but the lamb was phenomenal . would go back again for sure .
asian	never had dumplings so good before in any of those forms . it 's the dumpling equivalent of thriller - perfect .
asian	you can get them steamed , boiled or pan fried . we got the pan fried dumpings with beef onion curry and the boiled pork with chinese vegetables . both were fantastic and each order came with 15 dumplings . overall , great place for a quick afternoon snack . very affordable too .
asian	they were very efficient , and we loved everything we ordered . we went on a sunday around 11 : 15 , and it was packed , but the friendly host got us a table within a few minutes . right after we sat down , though , the line was out the door ! go early . we liked the vegetarian steamed dumplings , the sesame balls , the dumpling soup , the pork short ribs in garlic sauce , and some tofu dish . everything was great , and i would absolutely go back next time i am in toronto ! also , for four people , the entire bill was $ 33 . can 't beat that .
asian	eccellente ! ! ! small place very cozy . service is fast . i always like to order the menu degustation for 28 $ is enough and with different kind of sushi . i love it ! ! ! i very racomended this restaurant ! ! ! for me the best sushi in montreal ! ! !
asian	we were originally going to book dinner at nobu , but at the behest of others we booked our resos here instead . we ordered the kabuto omakase and was absolutely delighted . service was amazing and we will definitely be back the next time we are in town .
asian	if you like eggrolls , get here now . their chicken chop suey and general tso 's chicken are both really delicious as well . the service is great and the restaurant is very beautiful . my family and i enjoy coming here for a delicious chinese meal when we are having a craving . parking can be a pain , but you can usually find some spots on the street either in front of the restaurant or behind it . you can also park closer to the jail and walk up second avenue if you don 't mind an extra stroll . looking forward to coming back again !
asian	the food is good , i do prefer to order from the menu rather than eat the buffet , but i think it is just me being picky ! the staff is usually friendly and efficient ! you never need to ask for a refill and your plates are always cleared !
asian	especially the happy hour and sake ! ! great servers also ! ! only place i found in the valley that has pei mussels .
asian	i just wished i was still a student at uoft when this place was opened so i could come during lunch and study . there is plenty of space for a downtown location and the price is reasonable . i just cant seem to get enough taiwanese popcorn chicken . theyre the best !
asian	i 've been all over japan , and this is by far the most authentic food i 've had since i 've been there . everything is on point and delicious . the noodles are fantastic , and the takoyaki is just as amazing . great place ! !
asian	great takoyaki and gyuu ! my favourite is the umami don and gyuu don i 've never been disappointed here !
asian	everyone in there is just super friendly and the food is amazing ! there are days when i eat here for breakfast then do a quick run for lunch . i 'd have to say that the spicy korean chicken bowl is one if my favorites . if i 'm in the mood for beef i always get teriyaki beef bowl with onions and mushrooms . ross j 's just has so many choices that there is always something new . i would definitely recommend eating here ! fast . friendly . and good . what more could someone want ?
asian	last few times i 've got the irish roll and found it was the most amazing sushi i 've ever had . chefs are personable and friendly . best of las vegas nominees for sure in the sushi category . i 'll be back , of course
asian	the lunch plates are heavenly ! the potato mac is to die for ! my favorite is the katsu chicken & teriyaki chicken . their homemade katsu sauce is simply delicious
asian	everything about this place was amazing ! the food , atmosphere and the presentation ! when you first enter , all the chefs behind the long bar table greet you with hoorahs. the dishes are appetizer sized so i was able to try everything with 4 others. i recommend the udon with fish eggs. also the first time i had sake with dinner and it was moonstone plum sake which the waitress recommended and it was really good , sweet kind of like a juice. im not a big fan of sake , but this one was good. i highly recommend this restaurant. expect to talk loudly. friendly friendly environment
asian	everything is made from scratch from a small open kitchen . staff is very accommodating . menu is a little confusing ( there 's 3 ) best bet is to order off the photos on the wall . its not fancy not even close .. but its amazing . the wontons are being made as they serve you . they have family style tables that turn to share with your guests . there 's only three of us so , we ordered potstickers , veggie ramen , wonton pork noodle and pepper steak . honestly everything is amazing here .. but the soup is the star ! i will be back soon . thank you wonton !
asian	everything on the menu is absolutely delicious and the food is so unique that it 's a very refreshing change to the usual food options ! it 's great as take-out or dine-in , and every single dish i tried is incredible ! to top it all off , the staff and the owners are super nice and they actually care and appreciate your feedback - highly recommended ! !
asian	everything tastes delicious and portions were huge ! this place has amazing quality , does not skimp on meat either . this is coming from someone from toronto whom has huge options of chinese food downtown ..... lucky to have been passing by whitby to oshawa ( to get my g license ) and decided on some chinese food ... found one of the best spots . if i lived closer i would definitely eat here every day .
asian	the crab wontons were delicious . everything was homemade and tasted great .
asian	everything was fantastic . i want to come back and hope they do a katsu curry special for lunch
asian	everything was outstanding . the combos can sound intimidating on paper , but once you taste them , they totally make sense . the salmon and persimmon dish mimics bacon , the wagyu is a must . you can 't go wrong with anything . homemade ginger ale is awesome , as is the coconut sake . the service was really something . everyone seemed to really about how our experience was , how we heard of them . it really made a difference .
asian	everything was so fresh and delicious ! staff was very friendly , we never went without drinks . will def be back ! ! !
asian	everything was so great the food , drinks , atmosphere and employees everyone was super nice . definitely will be going back ! ! me and my boyfriend sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chef was one on one with us and we had a really great time !
asian	everything was so great ! the right spice mixture , vegetables were perfect ! vegetables are hearty slices and protein in every bite . the girl who took the order was so sweet and they took the time to be precise . delivery was fast and it was easy to give them a tip ! the ny egg rolls are my favorite ! if you get any dish , i highly recommend the " house " style ! if i could give 6 stars , i would . a merry christmas it was !
asian	everything we had had its on distinct flavor . all the meat dishes were great , not fatty , very lean . we will definitely return many times !
asian	everything we have ordered from this place has been delicious . this is are go to thai place in south charlotte . the staff is well trained and can answer any question you have and also gives great recommendations . the atmosphere is nothing fancy or upscale but the food is very good truly authentic tastes ! we love it ! try this place ! !
asian	everything we ordered was flavorful and delicious ! service was great and our food came out hot and in a timely manner . they are generous with their portion as well . my favorite was the bun rieu ! so rich in flavor didn 't really have to add any seasoning to it just chili powder for that kick . wanted it again the next day but didn 't get to make it back
asian	great ramen , quick , and friendly service . chashu isn 't the most buttery i 've had , but the broth is dericious . will be back !
asian	thai iced teas seemed to have gotten bigger . food is extremely flavorful . we always get a seat around 530pm : )
asian	i have been going to this restaurant for over 10 years and they have always impressed me . being a foody in the valley i find a lot of restaurants under par but my mouth is always happy here .
asian	* love ! * portion sizes are huge ! fresh was and flavour are amazing and the service is great ! they are very friendly and the atmosphere is perfect for an intimate date or time with a great friend . : )
asian	every time we come here the food is always so delicious ... pretty decent size portions a lot of options as well . great customer service . not too pricey either i recommended to check it out .
asian	we moved here a year ago and have lins every other week ! fresh lrg shrimp and pork fried rice are great !
asian	excellent ! stellar ! usually being completely honest vegetarian food to me just taste so boring and tasteless . not here , it is absolutely creative subtle and amazing what they do at veggie house . my upmost respect to the creator of the menu and overall service from this restaurant . my personal recommendation is the kung pow chicken ! everything taste like real meat except even sometimes even better ! : ) hits the spot and doesn 't get you bloated . definitely the top recommendation for vegetarians and even vegans .
asian	everything i 've eaten here has been awesome ! try the ufo for desert i was blown away !
asian	best sea food i have ever had . much recommended . i loved the service , good price and very clean .
asian	both the sushi and the service were " 5 star " ! we appreciated charles ' personable service and he had knowledge of the best items to order - in fact , he did all the work ! we just sat back and enjoyed every dish that was served . loved the lychee saki , the yellowtail app , the tostadas , the hydro bib lettuce wraps ! i will definitely be returning to soho japanese !
asian	chef was very knowledgeable , helpful , & fun to talk to . my bf is usually very hard to please with food and he loved it ! so comfy & intimate , just what we were looking for ! service , food , & atmosphere is outstanding . don 't pass this one up !
asian	i highly recommend this place , it worths every single penny !
asian	don 't be fooled by the front ! ! this place is delicious ! ! wait staff very friendly and with an expansive menu , they are very helpful to those of us who are not fluent in indian / pakistani foods . mild or spicy , they will help you find one of many foods to suit your tastes . we will definitely be back often !
asian	food- 5 stars ( salt and pepper shrimp ) service- 5 stars atmosphere- 5 stars i never would have thought such a good chinese restaurant could be slapped in the middle of vegas . will definitely be coming back
asian	food was delicious , we went with the omakase 7 course menu on our server 's recommendation and were not disappointed . each dish was tastier than the last , and we got to experience the whole range of the menu . the service was friendly and enhanced our dinner service . on a side note : whoever gave philip a bad review obviously doesn 't have a clue , as he is awesome .
asian	service was great and the atmosphere was something unique yet comforting . i couldn 't begin to specifically choose what dishes are the best because they are all worth trying ! this place is a must try . the staff is amazing , they really take care of you . my drink never had a chance to sit empty on the table . this is one place i cant wait to visit again .
asian	gorgeous place . tasty food . friendly people . definitely worth every dollar spent .
asian	great people and excellent food ! even treated me to free chicken wings on the house ! !
asian	and i probably would have to owe all the credit to bernard our server who was polite , knowledgeable , attentive , and just a delight to talk to ! you are awesome ! ! ! from one server to another stay awesome ! and the food is always good and drinks as well ! had to give the yard house credit !
asian	i loved everything about this place . the only thing i can complain about is that they don 't take reservations . meat quality is excellent and the marinades are sooooo flavourful . i love the sides that are available as well ! i really believe this is the best japanese bbq place in toronto period . the fact that it 's ayce is just a huge added bonus .
asian	i really liked the way they serve their dishes - so unique and interesting . i ordered a curry here and it was pretty good ( but not the best ) . i took one star off because the green curry could be more flavourful and it was way too runny . i prefer thicker sauces with more veggies inside . however their oad thai was really good . the other reason why i probably won 't come back so soon is the crowds - it is very loud here . it is not a place to go on a date ( you won 't hear each other unless you almost yell ) , or want to spend a quiet , relaxing time .
asian	amazing experience .... i will eat anything uni but boy there uni pasta is delicious .... had the calamari for apps it 's a little garlicky for my taste but overall it was fantastic !
asian	k and his parents took a great care for us . the fish was arrived on day and everything is so fresh ! learnt a lot of japanese culture there as well !
asian	like a brazilian churascaria but korean . the spicy chicken ( raw ) and kfc chicken ( precooked ) was legit . the beef tongue and brisket was also great . my husband loved the shrimp but it was too much work for me to peel . will definitely come again . and $ 20 pp is a great value !
asian	the taste was fabulous . i love the broccoli with cheese , and the beef toro the staffs were very nice and helpful . my favorite is the bulgogi .
asian	the restaurant is byob , and don 't be fooled by the lasers outside , the atmosphere inside is wonderful : elegant and quiet enough to talk . we brought a bottle of wine and ordered three hibachi dinners , one with filet mignon , one with scallops and the last with chicken . all were great , but the filet mignon was a knockout . tender and perfectly cooked . on top of it all , the servers were courteous and attentive . definitely going back !
asian	there was about a 10 min wait for seating because it was dinner rush , which wasn 't a huge deal at all . chicken karaage side was super yummy , loved the texture of the rice . the ramen was incredible , super flavourful and filling with nice thick noodles that weren 't too soft but also not too chewy . service was quick , the server was friendly and the food was great !
asian	very authentic food with delicious sauce . welcomed when i walked by a very professional staff the explained the menu to me in detail . definitely coming back !
asian	was in town and looking for a great ayce kbbq place not too far from the strip . happen to scroll through yelp and found this awesome place ! great decor and interior with booth seating . their brisket was fantastic with lots of marble , shrimp was fresh , and their pork belly was off the hook ! the staff is phenomenal ! very courteous and professional . i have many experiences at other bbq places where the service was rude and disrespectful . not this place ..... so if you all are in town , check out doh korean ! you won 't be disappointed
asian	we ordered the $ 125 omakase . so so good and totally worth the money . highly recommended
asian	you select from dozens of stir fry ingredients to make it your own secret recipe , millions of possibilities ! then watch the grill masters expertly put the finishing touches on your meal . great atmosphere and a healthy alternative . highly recommend making mongo 's your favorite family spot !
asian	one of the top sushi restaurants in toronto , and the price is quite reasonable ; $ 80 / pp for a 18 sushi dish meal , and at the end you can pay extra to try something again or something that wasn 't on the menu ! definitely pay the few extra to try what 's in season , we had the golden ice snapper , very tasty ! like what others said , book in advance at the bar seat ( not the table ! )
asian	we always order pork bone soup and fried dumplings . so good ! ! ! ! the one tiny thing that can make it better is a bit more variety of the side dishes . the kimchi is awesome ! !
asian	fast delivery , generous portions , fresh food , polite delivery guy and delicious crab puffs . definitely my new go-to chinese delivery .
asian	we got the gobi manchurian ; it is delicious ! they also have full vegetarian plate . i 'm coming back for that next time ! the waiter told us they switch out the curries so you will get a different mixture everytime .
asian	i came here with two friends , ordered the medium sushi + sashimi platter and received a free cooked salmon which was pretty cool . the service was good and i found the pricing quite fair . i would caution people about the parking as it is limited . otherwise , this is a great , unpretentious place to grab a bite .
asian	favorite in vegas so far out of all restaurants went too . great place to bring your friends and family too . great staffs ! great food !
asian	i have been looking for a good spot in phoenix and the food along with the service i have experienced here , make it amongst my favorite places to go when i 'm craving my moms cooking . from the pancit , dinuguang , lumpia , adobo and lechon i can 't ever decide what to eat . they serve as a 1 , 2 or 3 item meal but also have the option to purchase single servings in various sizes . craving some good filipino food .... stop by
asian	sisig is so damn good . everything is good ! for a city that really needs culture , this place hits the spot . do yourself a favor and try this out . the have bbq if you aren 't too adventurous . also , get a damn halo halo , they are amazing ( personally , i would ditch the jackfruit because i can 't stand the taste but you may like it ) .
asian	finally a real good real authentic filipino food in downtown . baldwin street , please welcome a huge success in platito . food was great , people were great , atmosphere is so family oriented . they will take care of you there , you won 't be dissatisfied . make sure you get the ube waffles and chicken !
asian	best pho i 've had since i left seattle walked out with all my favs to make spring rolls at home def gonna be a returning customer ! thank you so much and the combination fried rice was fabulous !
asian	enjoy fresh spicy healthy soups ? ravi hits the spot . vegetarian options . compassionate meat choices . don 't be put off by the casual atmosphere : ravi is simple and splendid . ( bonus : if you have a cold , just what the doctored ordered ! )
asian	fresh and tasty ! warm bread to start . the house salad was a meal in and of itself ! the red diablo sauce on the bigoli noodles was absolutely authentic and very , very delicious ! a real gem ! the service was awesome as well . only here for a few days , but we know where to go for authentic italian the next time we are in town !
asian	i drove by & popped in for last minute take out . i enjoyed talking with the owner while i waited and he recommended some great lunch specials ! food was fast , delicious and healthy . i 'll definitely be coming back and trying a new dish every visit : )
asian	healthy , fresh and great flavor . i found it much better than chipotle in terms of quality . the lemongrass chicken is amazing and penang sauce had awesome spice . really impressed !
asian	black garlic oil ramen was one of the best i have ever had ! that 's saying a lot as my husband and i have even had ramen in japan ! my husband has the shout tonkatsu which was also delicious ! ! the ramen shop is small which feels authentic to most traditional japanese ramen spots . the service was quick , and the waitresses were sweet and friendly ! the restaurant is located in " chinatown " off the strip , not an area to go walk around by any means . but worth the trip if you want some uber delicious ramen ! !
asian	i will be a regular here , without question .
asian	sat at the bar and ordered a few beers while enjoying curry , noodles , fried shrimp , chicken skewers and the best sticky rice with mango i 've ever had ! note : this place gets packed around 6pm . make reservations or arrive prior to 5 : 30 to get a seat . another note : part of the restaurant does not have an alcohol license so depending on your plans for the night , it may be faster to sit there !
asian	thanks yelp ! my husband and i split a dinner , we had a thai chicken salad , chili mint chicken , tom yum , and panang chicken ! it was so flavorful and great quality . we finished off our meal with non-dairy coconut ice cream ... yum !
asian	they let us in even though they were closed for a private party . jhehni was our server , she was awesome and kind . she suggested the bone marrow as an appetizer garlicky tasty mammoth bones . mom had chicken inasal husband had binagoongan , crispy pork belly with eggplant and vegetables and i had fusion mix of cuban with a phillipino spicing , it was ground beef with chick peas , raisens with a fried egg on top . it came with yummy fried plantains . will definetly come back !
asian	amazing firecracker roll and soft shell crab so delicious all he sauces amazing love this place will be back
asian	service was fast . make reservations before hand . tables are a little cramped for space . what gem in the city ..
asian	shrimps were great ! went for the captain 's bowl sauce - medium spicy heat . it could 've been hotter . garlic bread and cajun fries were amazing as well .
asian	first off ... the bottled water on the table is fantastic . it is very clear and tasteless . very good . secondly , the tiny serving dishes that the food is presented in is super adorable and it helps with not taking too much . the place is very clean and modern . service is quick and friendly . a bit pricey at 50.00 a person but totally worth it .
asian	thanks to chef irene for recommending the unagi and takoyaki !
asian	family and veteran owned , the owner and his wife are very kind and energetic . the jerky is made in store and the fusion of spices in the jerky is unbelievable . the flavor unravels in your mouth as you chew . they also have yummy fruit rolls , fruit juices , and incredible barbecue sauces . this is definitely my new favorite local jerky spot .
asian	first time going here today and it was the best orange chicken i 've ever had . must try even if you aren 't vegan
asian	first time here and my girlfriend and i had the cashu and fire ramen w / added beef bulgogi . very different dishes but equally delicious . the fire ramen was a dry ramen dish with just the right amount of spice . the added beef really made it pop . the cashu was more traditional and served in a delicious broth . the service was great and damien impressed with his knowledge and friendliness . we will certainly be going back for seconds !
asian	first time here , tried the poke bowl with spicy tuna and crab . the miso sauce on top is a must ! great service , great food , and a great concept ! looking forward to trying everything else on the menu ! !
asian	first time i 've had a sushi burrito and it was just the best i 've had ! ! i got the twin dragon , which they said was their number one best seller , and i can see why . the spicy tuna was actually spicy , and the crab was delicious ! honestly all the flavors went together so well , it was so good . for the price as well , i got mine for $ 10.50 , and i thought that was perfect . overall , i would come back over and over .
asian	first time there and so pleased so worth the money i got a ton of sushi ! ! ! ! love love love & the staff was so friendly i had no clue what i was doing & he talked me through everything ! highly recommend ! !
asian	first time there & the service was the best . i don 't think it can get better than here for korean steak house , i was really impressed ! the food was good quality & delicious & the staff was very friendly , helped with the menu , happy to answers all questions , & smiling . felt completely welcomed & values as a customer
asian	first time to vegas and heard about this place from a friend . reviews do not lie . it is delicious ! ! great flavors , fresh fish , nice atmosphere and delicious saki . chef john is awesome and so is all the staff ! ! if you don 't know what you want just ask them . my meal was amazing and over half of it i didn 't directly order , just said what should i have ? will definitley come back anytime i 'm in vegas ! !
asian	the food is so fresh and very hot in a good way though . i 'm definitely coming back here multiple times .
asian	everything is so fresh fried ! lovely environment ! will visit again for sure !
asian	definitely one of the best sushi places in the city .
asian	quiet mid week lunch i joined 3 others at the sushi bar and scanned the menu . sashimi combo- 2 cuts of 4 fish but mouthwatering delicious . monkfish liver sushi was a nice change . never had it before and actually i don 't recall seeing it on other menus . not bad . i 'd order it again . tako roll was small . a let down compared to the amazing presentation of fish . the takeaway here is high quality in an upscale location with warm charm and great service . you do pay for what you get but it 's worth it . i 'll be back for dinner with friends .
asian	i order delivery so never been to the restaurant , but always friendly service .
asian	stop by for poke you won 't be disappointed !
asian	five stars for all . never been before . but this place is really great . the waiter was so energized and tell in one minute what 's going on over there ! ! ! the beers are so interesting , i think we 'll come back only to trate the another twenty beers they have . the service was extremely fast . really fast . even the music was funny , asian pop and rap videoclips was playing all the time . this is the right place if you don have nothing to do late at the night ) ) )
asian	excellent staff and very neat and clean . the food actually taste like a real japanese noodle shop ! and reminds me of how it was like in japan !
asian	amazing flavorful food great pricing an excellent lunch special soshi bar chef on point they do get buzy and it is a tiny place but worth a try
asian	1-10 spice level : level 6 accumulated heat at a tolerable range . large entree and green tea , quite affordable at less than $ 15 !
asian	had the shoyu ramen with goyza appetizer ... delish !
asian	we ordered a lot . everything was wonderfully prepared . rich , authentic flavor . perfect texture execution . cozy decor . i can 't believe this place doesn 't have a huge line for a table . most delicious and authentic indian food i have had in vegas .
asian	have thoroughly enjoyed everything i 've ordered and specifically recommend tom ka , tom yum soups , spicy noodles , and trusting anything the staff recommends . you will enjoy and return . good food , good people !
asian	had dinner with my family last weekend while in las vegas . we ordered several dishes and had a " family style " dinner . everything was to die for ... lobster dim sum is a must !
asian	i 'm in town for work and saw the ratings so i thought i 'd give it a try . new to the vegetarian world and this place lives up to its ratings .
asian	we had : calamari - lightly breaded , excellent flavor . tom ka soup - perfectly prepare with generous portions of chicken and veggies lettuce wraps - bold flavor with extremely fresh lettuce bowls spicy eggplant with scallops - an instant favorite cucumber salad - good , but not great . dressing had too much sugar service was lightning fast ! we ordered online , then arrived 8 minutes later and they were just finishing up .
asian	jelly fish was great . flounder , shrimp salad , octopus , stewed crab . the food came out family style and there is always enough to share .
asian	the staff and service were great ... tip : ask the hostess for a spice level recommendation .... hot in this place is really hot
asian	the regular was filling and worth the price . would def go back .
asian	i have only ever done take out but every time it has been delicious . expect a long wait every time because it 's always packed but if you plan a head you will not be disappointed .
asian	love the authentic hand made noodles . i dont mind spicy foods but the spicy beef noodle bowls has the perfect amount of spice and flavour thats not overwhelming to the taste . definitely my new favourite comfort food for the winter time .
asian	i absolutely loved this place , came across it on yelp . i don 't eat pork and loved that this place he chicken options . from miso to spicy jalapeño . the flavour was so good , layered with a choice of thick or thin noodles . add ins included egg , scallions , garlic and etc , you can customize your ' basic ' ramen with a ton of options . loved the service , loved the food . you 'll be greeted in some ( what i assume ) is a cool japanese greeting by the staff . if you 're a foodie , get a seat by the cooking area so you can catch the staff making your delicious ramen .
asian	affordable price . great and speedy service ! the staff are attentive and welcoming . the chef is making the noodles right in front of you !
asian	a friend recommended this place to us . i was a little skeptical due to the variety of the different types of food , but pleasantly surprised ; i got chinese and so was my husband ; who got mexican .
asian	a great collection of kebabs from seafood to meat lovers that make great appetizers with a cold pitcher of beer . i also had the baked chicken that was marinated with a light curry . delicious ! most of all the service and ambience is wonderful . highly recommended for those who want to have quality food in a place that is warm and inviting but want to watch the pocket book . pretty new place so hopefully the quality and service stays the same .
asian	the wait is usually between 25-45 minutes but it is worth it . we go at least twice a month . and they will modify super spicy dishes to make them less spicy .
asian	all pastas are delicious , you can not go wrong . the prosciutto appetizer was amazing and so was the bread and everything else . hole in the wall atmosphere really small , intimate . easy 5 star rating for food and service . service might be different then what you expect but the staff was great .
asian	all you can eat makes it a fantastic value .
asian	the best place in town for great quality , fresh , and healthy food . i have tried a lot of different things on the menu , and i can 't complain about a single dish , everything is delicious !
asian	always come here for their fresh sashimi and very tasty food . the owner is very hands on and actually remembers his loyal customers . a must have while in vegas !
asian	always good customer service ! ! my favourite is their kimchi tofu soup and their veggie tofu soup ! ! !
asian	always happy to come back here . its friendly clean and comfy . food was plated beautify as well . beef salad is my favorite thing on the menu so far .
asian	always hot ! always friendly people ! very clean ! meats nice and juicy all the sides are yummy !
asian	amazing ambience . may be the best thai food i 've had in the city . not suprised though . sukothai and kao san road are also really good . sense of authenticity and very flavourful . didn 't hurt that they were playing a 90s hip hop playlist when i was in there too ! excellent all around .
asian	amazing ambience . the sexual innuendo is second to none . i 've never laughed so hard at a restaurant . great date place for sure .
asian	just an overall great experience . we really wanted chinese cuisine and we arrived about 15min before close . they didn 't make any uncomfortable faces or made us feel unwelcome . i would totally recommend this place , and will arrive way earlier next time to really look over the menu and have time to enjoy my food just a bit more ! this will easily be my favorite place now !
asian	had a fantastic girls night with all you can drink beer or sake and all you can eat sushi . i honestly can 't wait to go back ! i found my new favorite sushi place .
asian	definitely recommend the fresh squeezed lemonade ! ! so good ! ! definitely found my favorite pho spot in the valley !
asian	amazing customer service . amazing owners . very reasonable prices . this place serves both korean and hawaiian food . love it here
asian	amazing customer service and delivery . ordered online at 10pm , had the order to me in 20 minutes - fresh and perfect - though it seems they close at 10 : 30 . unbelievable . i liked them before , but they are more impressive than words !
asian	i am so glad someone suggested it to me ! the shrimp curry shots were soo good , i could literally eat them every single day . i will def be going on a weekend night because the bar looks really cool . i 'd give more stars if i could
asian	get the noodles with pork , get the squid & jalapeños , get the tripe , get the squid again . you won 't be disappointed .
asian	amazing fast and sweet service ! ! ! amazing atmosphere , so cute and one of the best restaurants in montreal the dolsot bibimbap and kimbap are delicious
asian	the quality is extremely good . my favorite is the beef bulgogi bibimbap
asian	completely worth the wait . limited seating so plan to take away .
asian	amazing . my husband and i went here the other night and split 4 dishes between us . we got the manchurian fish , calamari , boneless chilli chicken and chow mien . the manchurian fish was life changing . just insane . the flavour and spice or it was incredible and the texture was melt in your mouth good . we ate until we were stuffed be had leftovers for days . the decor is unimpressive but the waitstaff was nice but that 's not what draws me to a restaurant . the food was definitely worth it .
asian	follow them on fb if you haven 't yet and then order the pork belly
asian	we did the buffet and it was fun to try many different dishes . they told us that they also have a projector for sports games . will definitely return again .
asian	amazing food amazing portions we love going there again n again ...... try the gobi manchurian and american veg chopsuey it 's just amazing .... best chinese restaurant for both veg n non veg food
asian	definitely going to be out for sure chinese food place !
asian	i love sushi and am a sushi snob . this place is fabulous in all areas . everyone needs to try it !
asian	amazing prices . delicious . love the simple yet perfect menu . something for everyone 's likes from simple california roll to japanese lasagna to sashimi . kris was our server and was perfect . very attentive and the good came very fast .
asian	a huge shout out to tk and david . your hospitality and attention made my experience even better ! !
asian	amazing service . amazing decor . we will be back ! ! ! the noodle veggie soup was similar to phu but better ! ! boyfriend had the buffet and was able to try a variety of foods and he was impressed . he 's been to thailand and he loves this place . good brick walls are a cool touch .
asian	amazing service . amazing environment . i would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting vegas . try the yellow tail , it is by far the highlight of their menu .
asian	i thought the bathrooms were very nice too. would definitely recommend guu to anyone who likes japanese food and is looking for a new experience !
asian	i probably shouldn 't divulge my secret that is the awesomeness of wangs because i don 't have want to have to wait for a table ever , but it is the best chinese food restaurant in the west valley , if not all of arizona ! tucked into a corner of a strip mall , it 's easy to miss , but you don 't want to miss this . we had the orange chicken and wangs fried rice , plus the fried crab puffs and ( omg , the biggest , best ) egg rolls . it was all amazing ! no frozen food here , it 's all clearly prepared in their kitchen . just simply the best chinese food around !
asian	a favourite among all the options vegas has to offer .
asian	a must try ! we took the wagyu platter for 2 , because it 's not everywhere we can have that . it was 85 $ and a lot of varieties of side dishes . i loved the fish cake and kim chi soup ! ! ! their are choices for seafood as well !
asian	amazing service . awesome noodles were the table favorite . highly recommend this place ! !
asian	amazing service . cheap . large portions . sesame seeds ( ! ) on the table , with other condiments . i 'll the other yelpers to the work with the details . when my roommate said she wanted roman noodles instead of sushi , i thought she was nuts , but wow .... i will definitely be returning !
asian	my family and i have come to lisbon by night for many different occasions ... birthdays , anniversaries , baptisms , confirmation and for just a night out . dalia ( the owner ) is always so accommodating , super friendly and always present to insure all her customer are happy .
asian	waiting staff and chefs all very friendly and interacted with us during our meal to ensure we had a great experience . amazing bang for buck if you 're hungry and need a lot of protein and carbs !
asian	haven 't tried anything i didn 't love ! definitely my favorite thai spot in las vegas !
asian	amazing food ... amazing service ... homemade coconut ice cream to top it all ... vegan and gluten free food which is very difficult to come by just one at a time we found both in one restaurant ... we will definitely be back ...
asian	i got the pad se iew and it 's easily the best one i 've had in the valley . 100 % better than thai basil and i completely recommend coming and stoping by . the owner is so sweet also and wants to make sure you are having amazing food .
asian	amazing service . i 'm shocked to see such poor reviews . all of us enjoyed our food . i mean everything we ordered . it is a little pricey but not bad for vegas . i would love to come back again . we had crabmeat wontons and seafood curry and taro tea . overall everything just simply excellent .
asian	i was a little confused about the menu at first but with some help from the awesome staff i got a make your own plate with veggies , beef teriyaki and white rice . it was delicious ! not greasy , prepared fresh and a great portion size ! now , we go here at least once a week . my fiance gets the furikake bento and he loves it ! i highly recommend this place !
asian	amazing service ! i wish they changed their ( fluorescent ) lighting , but otherwise , it 's an incredible experience !
asian	the bulgogi and tootsie roll are my favs . perfect date night , definitely will be back !
asian	amazing service ! their crab salad is so light and tasty . food is made fast and you never feel rushed to get in , eat and get out . they have revamped their menu to include a number of items for those not adventurous . definitely will be coming back !
asian	amazing service ! tons of fun ! come here if you want to have a great night !
asian	amazing service , very friendly , efficient ! ! ! the ayce is so worth the price ... on some of the rolls you can even do half rolls ! thats what we did and was able to have more of a variety . i totally recommend this place ! ! ! !
asian	we ordered sushi ( california roll ) and shshito peppers as apetizers , and the curry chicken and beef udon noodles as entree . everything was fresh , tasty , and the portions were right . thewaitress , rebecca , was really good : she suggested the curry chicken and the carrot cake as dessert , with honest opinions on everything on the menu . the price was definitely worth it . we 'll suggest this place and come back often !
asian	when in ajax we always go here if we can . the staff is always friendly and accommodating . the food is perfectly spiced and flavourful . i recommend this place to everyone !
asian	amazing service . would def recommend . their garlic sauce ( dip ) is the best ! the quantity they serve is actually more . if you are ordering a starter or dessert you might need a to go box . def would recommend this place
asian	bar only has beer , wine and japanese drinks .
asian	amazing service . you 'll get some unique vietnamese dishes that you won 't get anywhere else .
asian	amazing set up . amazing atmosphere . still going to give them 5 stars even though i want to give them 4 because they 're so boujie and only have lunch special mon-thurs . 5 stars because workers are friendly and food is bomb .
asian	fast delivery . they have expanded . my go to place for amazing hungarian food made fresh to order . try them out you will not be disappointed .
asian	amazing staff . love how they keep the menu fresh ! ! and they always adding new things . they even got a secret menu ! ! ! ! ! ! the owners are super awesome . 5 stars all the way .
asian	never had real ramen but was blown away at how great it was .
asian	top notch all around . i always order to go and they treat me just as equal as a walk in . love it here . definitely a must try pinoy joint
asian	an amazing place for special occasions as its a little pricey than other indian restaurants . you can get the spice level adjusted to your taste .
asian	i got a delicious coconut dish that tasted like heaven . the sweet tea tastes like green jasmine tea which is a nice new flavor and goes well with the cuisine . however it was really really sweet and they kept refilling our glasses without asking , so be careful because i got a sugar high !
asian	we ordered three meat options , a starter and a vegetable . delicious and top notch .
asian	amazing food and a great place to take a date too. http : / / www.visitwynn.com / documents / mizumi.pdf
asian	servers were cheerful and asks how our meal was quite frequently . only issue was the ordering pads require employees to approve the order which slows down the wait for food .
asian	tony the owner was so nice and explained everything on the menu for us . fair prices and a nice atmosphere
asian	i come here very often and they yet to disappoint ! i often have problems choosing what to eat since everything is really good . nothing warms you up on a cold winter day like a nice bowl of soup ! i highly recommend nicey 's to anyone looking for authentic jamaican food !
asian	a great spot for vegetarian indian food to either dine in or for catering services . totally worth it !
asian	love finding new ramen places in vegas . quick and accurate must try the chicken bun .
asian	line ups are too much for me on the weekend . , but as a chef i know that you will get the best service on a weekday so it 's fine by me !
asian	the food is great and the all you can eat deal is really worth the price .. we are from boston and we are definitely coming back to vegas and visiting this restaurant .. 5 stars all around
asian	as my best friend said " the food has all the right seasonings without being too spicy . " i just love how i can taste all the different flavors . my sisters always get the papaya salad , i love the veggie or chicken pho . especially when fighting a cold !
asian	definitely will be coming backthe friendliest servers too ! !

asian	i always get spicy miso with pork belly . my favorite place to eat . i think i 've eaten there a million times already . lol
asian	i am hooked on the one of a kind calamari and have never had a dish there that i didn 't absolutely love . highly recommend
asian	i lived in thailand for 3 years , so i know good thai food when i find it . i recommend the coconut milk chicken soup as well as the drunken noodles . explore thai food at sala thai and you 'll be hooked to its unique blend of flavors . oh and they have boba , good boba . hard to find that stuff on the west side .
asian	loved everything and they went the extra mile for our business . new go to sushi .
asian	lychee martini and tuna with crispy rice are always my favorite !
asian	really friendly people and phenomenal food , definitely one of the better japanese places in vegas . the interior is also very sleek . not cheap but that 's to be expected . i can 't remember much else since it was so long ago that i came here , but see my photos !

asian	side dishes were too many . it main item was on my one . : ( great dessert , overall great experience

asian	we went to simis after reading that they ranked # 1 for chinese food in az . we were not disappointed and now see why they were # 1 . their food is so good ! my favorite mongolian beef i 've ever had . great lunch specials too . the server there is so sweet she remembers us every time we go in . we drive all the way from glendale to go that 's how good it is ! it 's almost a 2hr round trip drive and i would make it any time just to have simis ! ! !
asian	the staff was very accommodating . we will definitely be back .
asian	would recommend to anyone who works or lives by to eat at this place at least one or twice a week ! delivery time is super fast !
asian	i didn 't eat thai food until i came to satay when it first open ( it 's across from my work ) . i fell in love with the flavors and decided i should try other thai restaurants in vegas . i have not found one that even comes close to matching the red curry , spicy basil , pad thai , or drunken noodles . i bet i have enjoyed lunch here over a hundred times since it opened and i have never had a bad meal . i will bet everything that you will love this place . it 's my favorite overall restaurant and i could eat here everyday .
asian	sushi is fresh also ! i reccomend war-su-gai or hibachi filet and chicken !
asian	modern decor and a great atmosphere . kind staff , fast servive . no debit though , must make withdrawls from atm at front . going in a large group would be advisable .
asian	cozy little restaurant . if i was to recommend a dish it would be the peanut curry with crispy pork and of course you must have sticky rice !
asian	the lobster pho is so good and innovative , and we loved all the appetizers we ordered . if you saw it on the food network then you best head over and try this place out because you won 't be disappointed . chef khai vu is on top of his game .
asian	big portions .. the service was good and the owner is really friendly and also the waiter too .. the butter chicken is great and also the bryani too ..... definitely coming back for more
asian	very expensive , but a taste experience unlike many we have had , so strongly suggest trying numerous things if you can budget about $ 200- $ 250 a person with drinks . small portions but beautifully created dishes . bravo nobu ! !
asian	we ordered red curry with chicken , veg curry and pineapple curry . wait was 15 mins and all the dishes were delicious . loved the pineapple curry . the egg rolls were crunchy and full of flavors . absolutely love with place . and don 't forget there thai tea .. yum yum ! !
asian	i 'm going on my third lunch this week ! the chicken teriyaki and ginger salad dressing is out of this world !
asian	the sampler box is amazing ! definitely best asian dinner in the chandler / tempe area
asian	often when i eat at nicer restaurants like this even though the food is great i walk away having spent a lot of money and am still hungry . not this place . we chose to go with one of the family style chef specials for 3 and was blown away with the quality and quantity . it covered 5 courses and was more than 3 big guys could eat . i highly recommend it .
asian	a group of us ordered the chili chicken , shanghai chicken noodle , bombay chicken , manchurian chicken fried rice and crispy beef . all were exceptionally tasty ! my new favorite hakka place .
asian	and prompt service ! ! could use more english speaking waiters / waitresses due to the language barrier but the fantastic food makes up for it ! ! eat here !
asian	i was so impressed by their entire vegan menu and at really great prices for the portions you get . the likeness of the meals to their animal based counter-parts in scary close ! i reccomend the fried house rice and orange chicken . very delicious ! !
asian	amazing food and quality , taste is so authentic , has a prayer room too .. wow .. my fav place in toronto
asian	nice atmosphere too . there 's always been a long wait to get a table whenever i 've gone , but they offer to take your number and call when your table is ready - so you can go around the corner and grab a drink while you wait : )
asian	i had the red curry with tofu and i finished it all ! my husband ordered the basil chicken and he enjoyed it as well ! wish they have this spot in los angeles !
asian	there 's sometimes a queue outside but the tables turnover pretty quickly . only downside is cash only and no splitting the bill but that small inconvenience hasn 't stopped me from coming back !
asian	also they are quick on service as well they see that your water is half empty they filling it up directly . the food is so good and also good thing with this place is open 24 / 7
asian	we will definitely go again even though it is a ways from our locating . the food is very authentic to when i was in korea and the price is great . yum !
asian	it is mine and my boyfriends every sunday ritual to get their hibachi chicken with soup and salad . it is a must eat !

asian	get there early , or call to make reservation . green curry was cook to perfection . we also ordered the crispy duck with the drunken noodle wow ! simply wow !
asian	great ambiance ! every time i go to vegas i make sure to come here . we started with my usual the spicy tuna on the crispy rice . then the chicken pad thai noodles and the shrimp friend rice and then two special sushi rolls . and too top it off got the special fortune cookie . def recommend coming here !
asian	i felt like i was right in their home , and i was their star guest . koy was especially helpful and nice .
asian	if you don 't care much for fancy restaurants but want quality chinese cuisine or just need to order something for pickup , this is an excellent place . make sure to try the house special chicken and salt and pepper fish filet . actually , everything is good . i keep coming back for more .
asian	i loved the diversity of the menu . definitely need to get the uni bibimbap and the kobe ssam ! their uni is so fresh !
asian	no other place beats it ! it was so good we booked it the following day as well . the chef is so attentive he marked down what we ordered the first day to change it up for us the following day so we could fully enjoy the range of fish he had .
asian	i was on the verge of hangry so i was happy when the fresh rolls ( best i 've had ) came quickly . we ordered the green curry and ginger fish , both amazing and we ate way too much and still had food to take home . can 't wait to try the phoenix location too ! this location is low on parking but , not a deal breaker and most of the time not a problem . plus , if you do end up walking a little you 'll have room for the chocolate cake ; )
asian	i wish they can upgrade their restaurant though , i 'm sure business would continue to do great !
asian	i would highly recommend to anyone who is craving some good quality authentic chinese food . would definitely come back .
asian	love that it is a bring your own wine so the price is a bonus . the sushi and sashimi are both extremely fresh . will definitely be going back . highly recommend this gem .
asian	make sure to reserve as this place is often very busy and i have seen them turn away costumes without reservations . beef is so good but the pork was alright .
asian	my family and i are from orange county , so we 're pretty picky with our vietnamese food but the food here is just as good as the ones back home ( if not better ) . the service was rather fast as well and our server is very accommodating and hospitable . we will definitely come back whenever we 're in town from now on .
asian	the tom yum seafood soup is the best i 've ever had

asian	the manager and staff are always friendly and happy to see us . the sushi is fresh and they have the best calamari i 've had anywhere ! try the dragons egg , so delicious . this is my date night sushi place .
asian	the meats are amazing and the best side dishes ever . the meal comes with so many sides it is difficult to finish ! price is very reasonable .
asian	the only negative is that on the weekends it is so busy that they want you to eat fast and go ! so they can sit the other people .... but i guess it 's a business and thats how it works . i would still highly recommend it !
asian	the portions at this restaurant are fairly small , so if you are going in a large group i suggest you speak to the waitress to ask for portions as we ordered 2-3 dishes of everything . the beer selection is quite good . the pad thai and fried chicken was amazing . service was good . its a bit tight on space so you have to be fairly cozy with the person beside you . the location of the restaurant is good however there is limited parking in the area .

asian	very nice ambience . we had the secret potstickers , tempura spinach salad , shrimp curry , pork green bean curry , and the bread pudding and everything was delicious . so glad we finally tried this place , will definitely be frequenting !
asian	was kind of overwhelmed since it was my first time trying poke bowls but savannah walked me through it , giving suggestions and explaining all the different sauces ( she was infinitely patient ) ! had tons of additional goodies like a free miso soup , tea and dumplings . portions are super generous , i wasn 't sure the small would fill me up but i couldn 't even finish it . i can 't wait to come back !
asian	we had the house soup . it was the best soup i ever had . would definitely come again
asian	we had the pulled pork and fire chicken plus the tofu wings . the only reason i gave 4 stars is because they were out of a ew of the menu items .
asian	went during the dinner rush , was seated within 20 minutes because it was that packed . my friends and i ordered neng myun , with kimchi jjim , and my fiancee ordered the chicken katsu . the portions are very generous , the neng myun broth was so refreshing with broth slush , korean pear slice , and pickled radishes . kimchi jjim was super tender and soaked with flavour . it was worth the drive and i 'm craving it again !
asian	went with a couple friends with dietary restrictions ( gluten , diary ) and the waiter helped us pick various ( delicious ) dishes . had six different entrees between four people and everything was so tasty and flavourful . my new favourite restaurant in the neighbourhood .

asian	go to the monte carlo and enjoy a meal at dragon noodle co . we loved the sizzling noodles , pork fried rice , lettuce wraps , potstickers and seabass . you can 't go wrong here !
asian	had been to both locations in etobicoke and brampton . though the food taste is good at both places , the ambience and presentation is much better in brampton location . nice staff and good service . sometimes it gets crowded and service is slow but that 's acceptable for busy place .
asian	intimate dining area . i recommend the man-du and bulgogi . we will be coming back to try more of the menu .

asian	do yourself a favor and try the salt and pepper squid and singapore rice noodles .
asian	i go to unlv so it 's very refreshing to have such a good restaurant so close to campus .
asian	the only thing that 's difficult about coming here is what to get ... so many delicious choices . my personal favorite is red curry or spicy fried rice and of course their famous thai tea on the side . and for dessert sweet sticky rice ! yum ! ! their prices are amazing and service is so quick ! there aren 't many places to sit so it 's best to come early or be prepared to wait but they 're worth the wait ! they always offer take out so you can enjoy their wonderful food from the comfort of your home or work .
asian	as good as in bangkok itself . friendly , fast service . great options and totally authentic , delicious food ! the art work on the wall is hand drawn by the owner , it 's awesome ... you 'll learn a bit about bangkok and thai food ! must go ! ! ! ! !
asian	one of the most important things to me is the bang for your buck , and for a very affordable price you get great portions that are delicious . the chicken with rice paper wraps were delicious , and the spring rolls are to die for . a great place for a quick bite to ear for an affordable price .
asian	ordered delivery and got it earlier than expected . overall a great experience . i 'm a flight attendant with a culinary degree and have eaten all over the world . this food is fantastic and such a pleasant surprise seeing that charlotte is a smaller city with less variety than others .
asian	service was very fast ! some of the best chinese food i 've had in the us
asian	would recommend the brisket , bulgogi , gyozas , steamed egg , and the cheese corn ! derek was our server and gave us exceptional service ! i will defintely be coming back the next time i 'm in vegas !
asian	the best thai food in toronto for sure . come for lunch but be ready to wait in line .
asian	my wife and i have been looking for a thai place to frequent , and even though this place is nearly half an hour away from us , it 's worth the drive . very flavorful curry and their fried rice was fried nicely without too much oil . will definitely come back soon .
asian	highly recommend for a date night or birthday party ! make a reservation .
asian	we come here with the family . the staff is polite . service can be slow at times but it 's never terrible . highly recommended as good healthy option .
asian	could not have had a better experience . so friendly and personable while walking us through the menu . it 's hard to decide which dish we like best !
asian	quality meats , awesome seasoning and extremely flavorful hot pots . my favorites include : spicy lamb , spicy beef , taiwanese hot pot and a yogurt drink ( or two ) ! i don 't review very often , but small businesses that are original and prioritize high quality food is well worth the money and i would highly recommend giving this place a try .
asian	service was quick . very basic restaurant but some of the best authentic thai food . pad thai , red curry and thai tea are the best options for us .
asian	went there on a rainy day hit the spot and the wonton noodle soup was perfect ! ! !
asian	this is my go to place for dim sum and fish maw soup with crab meat ! love this place and the service is very respectable and quite quick even at 3 : 00am haha ! totally recommend this place , plus there 's free parking ; )

asian	being from denver its not something we get to enjoy . yoshinoya was a must go when i would visit california as a child and now on my trip to vegas seeing one i needed to go . had a large angus beef and it was delicious . price is very reasonable ... under $ 10 including drink .
asian	and the service was great . my food hit the table in 10 minites flat ......
asian	best people / owners ! can 't go wrong with anything there ! the pho is amazing ! !
asian	best place for dinner in vegas . i 'm from la but i go to lv often and i never come without eating here . the restaurant is very nice and when you go in the evening fri-sun most of the people are dressed quite nice so it 's a bit awkward to go in jeans and a t-shirt if you 're not a teenager / kid . reservations is a must because they get very crowded and no one wants to wait all night to eat . the food is very expensive . i went with 5 other people and the bill was almost $ 400 but the food is worth it if you 're willing to pay a bit more .
asian	order the house made noodles or the beef with scallions both are my favorites .
asian	best thai teas in the area ! worth the wait . line out the door when they open for dinner . service is good as well .
asian	best things were the pea dumplings and octopus tacos . the duck was my least favorite , but still pretty good . loved the novelty of the big mac bao . also , our server was freaking amazing . nice ambiance as well !
asian	best tom yum goong i 've had in years . hit or miss service but they 're trying . expensive cab from the strip but the inexpensive deliciousness and chill atmosphere make up for it ! no liquor license .
asian	beware : the spice ratings are authentic . the food is so delicious . hooray .
asian	4 big meals and appetizer all for under 40.00 . this is a place we will be back for sure , i eat vegetarian only and they made sure to go and help me . i highly recommend this place
asian	i highly recommend the kalbi ribs and furikake chicken .
asian	busy though and pricey . make reservations ahead of time and get there early so your table is ready by the time your reservation is set for .
asian	everything is à la cart so it can add up fast ! my husband and i got the pork belly steam buns , salt and pepper garlic fries and the spicy miso burger and the bill was over $ 30 . however it was absolutely the best burger i have had in recent memory and we will be definitely back : )
asian	amazing food but i felt like i am in a nightclub , only house music every time i come here , the music should match the environment i hope they change it sushi is great and i really want to continue coming back
asian	it is really worth the wait though , i recommend the chicken wonton ramen .
asian	my family is partial vietnamese so we are very picky with vietnamese food . the chef / owner used to work at another restaurant , where my family used to visit religiously every weekend so i pretty much grew up eating her food . the bun hoi is really good ( spelling ? ) and the rice rolls with bbq meat is really good too .
asian	buttery black cod , flavourful ribeye that melts in your mouth . crispy rice with tuna was fabulous . i always come here when i do conventions in vegas . do not miss it !
asian	but the customer service in this place is over the top . the owner is very kind and everyone greets you with a smile . i 'm definitely coming back to this place
asian	go really early for lunch . haven 't even tried going for dinner . but the best thai food outside thailand . everywhere else in toronto ( save for their sister restaurants sabai sabai , etc ) is a joke .
asian	we have been looking for a decent noodle house since we left the culturally diverse bay area and we stumbled upon this gem . i had the beef noodle soup and it was perfect , not too salty or too bland . we also had the dumplings and they were not your tiny little frozen steamed and fried version these were obviously hand made and were full of meat . i would highly recommend this place and look forward to my next visit .
asian	it 's still worth it every few months to drop that cash .
asian	good service and one of the best sweet and sour chicken i 've had .
asian	came here for valentine 's day lunch with my girlfriend and the food was excellent !
asian	came here on a saturday night with no reservations and got in a table in 20 min with a packed restaurant . the server was very knowledgeable of the menu and had a answer for every question i asked . great service never waited long for drinks and food came out quicker then expected for a full house . the portions were huge and everything i ate had lots of flavor . seafood was the freshest i 've had and lots of it . ill definitely be back soon
asian	came here with a few friends looking to try something new and it was excellent . i 'm not a huge meat person , but the chicken was delicious ! it 's a little hole in the wall place that i was skeptical about at first , but again , food was amazing . very cheap and filling too !
asian	food came out very quickly and was very fresh . i had the curry stir fry with squid and it was spectacular . squid can get a little rubbery if prepared incorrectly and this was not the case- it was soft and perfect . my friend had one of the vermicelli dishes and she also enjoyed it ( and so did i when i stole a few bites ) . i will definitely be remembering saigon and return .
asian	can 't wait to try every dish on the menu ! ! highly recommend ! i will say they have a small dining room which is great for small parties . and they do allow you to bring your own wine with a small corking fee !
asian	cheap and great quality . i had beef taco and pork belly steamed bao . everything looks great . hip place .
asian	the dumplings are filling and very tasty . their selection is quite variable and it can satisfy the taste buds of any dumpling fan .
asian	chef was super nice and made us an awesome flank steak and crisp apple little starter . def will come back again and again . amazing service as well ! ! ! !
asian	chicken 88 or mumbai chicken are simply amazing . i 'm not veg . but i love their spicy pepper tofu . you gotta try it ! i have been going here for 8 years now .
asian	not all you can eat but feel good after the choices of meats and seafood i made . good quality and service . room ambience is nice with new music and good decor / color . just to share what i ate was beef toro , bulgogi , salmon wrapped in bacon and calamari as an appetizer ! thumbs up to this place
asian	choose basically anything and it will be awesome ! favorites included the eggplant , black pepper beef , soup dumplings , well really any and all of the dumplings . just close your eyes and point , it will be good , and authentic , if that 's not what your after you can still find something that you 'll like , but really it 's the authenticity of flavored that shine .
asian	clean and inviting restaurant ! will definitely be back ! awesome find for sure !
asian	clean restaurant and friendly staff . we dined in and the our food came quite quickly . portions are good too . ordered 3 plates came out full and with leftover !
asian	clean to the core ! i live on the other side of town ( summerlin ) and i have been to this restaurant 3 times , no dissapointment whatsoever . the parking is limited but not a problem . definitely recommend this place. i give it a 5 star for great taste , cleanliness and price ! payday is the next day i will be dining in .
asian	come here it is awesome . loved every bite . check in for free ice cream macaroon .
asian	come here with my wife once or twice a week whenever we want chinese food . and the prices are incredible for the quantity and great quality of the food . recommend here for everyone !
asian	you can get a choice of three meals or all 3 in one . so much delicousness in the accents and veggies used . a true health food resto that tastes amazing
asian	couple that with the extrodinary owners and you can 't help falling in love with miko 's . everything on their diverse menu is prepared with quality products and lots of care . the ramen is incredible as is all of their sushi . they open at 5pm and are closed sundays .
asian	follow them around the city and never cook again ! ! ! !
asian	creative and tasty . used to be my favorite place , but now that they 've opened the other location and hired new staff , you have to wait a decent amount of time to eat . if you have time , the food is well worth waiting for , just be prepared to be there for a while even if you 're the only client there .
asian	crispy beef is out of this world . tender jerky style beef with sweet spicy sauce . must try ! ! ! staff is really friendly and fast .. best halal chinese spot in gta .
asian	curries are good , i love the evil noodles . i 'm vegan and they 're super accommodating . it runs spicy , but i prefer it that way .
asian	curry dishes are fab . drinks are good , though , like many places in vegas , pricey . quick , quick service . can 't wait to go back !
asian	amazing food decent service very good chinese food only problem was took a little to refill the lunch plates
asian	definitely a hidden gem . i don 't like the fact that you can 't order the lunch portion to go and that the full portions are a bit pricey , however it 's worth it !
asian	... definitely good for fish lovers . try the fish masala and fish pakora for sure !
asian	delicious sauce , fresh food and you get a lot for the value . the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating . we will definitely be back again .
asian	quick , everything i ordered . will be a regular now . nice to have in steelyard , just moved here
asian	trust the owner for suggestions and enjoy . best to eat in .
asian	it 's beyond good the food is fresh ! ! and the taste is one of a kind , this mom and pop place takes sushi to another depth , if your ever close stop in .... that is if you get a seat : )
asian	d owner was very courteous and so were the waiters .. would definitely go there again . no buffet for lunch . but the food was delicious and filling .
asian	definitely going back . my boyfriend and i fell in love the red jade chicken .
asian	everything was above expectations . the octopus small plate was the most tender i 've ever had and a great mix of flavors and textures . also had the spicy seafood hot pot , rabbit dumplings , and a great gin cocktail .
asian	drunken noodles were amazing ! go to a half price tix booth and get 30 % off
asian	due to unforeseen circumstances we showed up almost two hours late for our reservation and just before kitchen closed and they couldn 't have been nicer . absolutely adore this restaurant , their service , and their food !
asian	dumplings were phenomenal- everything was made fresh and the service was excellent .
asian	eddie is a great chef ! the service is always exceptions ! my advice is to have eddie " battle " another chef !
asian	you automatically get starters when you sit down that are all great so you don 't have to wait to long to get a bite in while you 're waiting for the food to come / cook . that being said , you have to cook your own meat but that 's not difficult at all .
asian	the customer service is outstanding as well . would highly recommend : )
asian	never ever disappoints ! ! i went there for my birthday lunch and probably had the best roll i 've ever had . can 't remember exactly the name i think it was the d & t roll . massive and worth every penny ! ! !
asian	i have never see any smoke meat and steak like that . price : the best food : amazing location : hard to find the parking resturant : not fancy and hell busy , always line up .
asian	amazing food , everything i have tried is delicious , is a hole in the wall , but is hands down the best vietnamese food i have ever had
asian	everything is always perfect . the food tastes so fresh and leaves you feeling happy and nourished , not like some other restaurants that leave you feeling groggy . my fiance and i haven 't been able to go a week without eating here since we discovered it lol . the staff and owner are so nice and very helpful too . definitely give this place a try .
asian	everything was great had the family special .. large portions .. fresh food ! and literally the nicest people ever ! they go out of there way to make you happy : ) definitely going back
asian	everything was phenomenal ! the waiter was super helpful . all of his recommendations were spot on . must do singapore salad of course . plenty of veggies options for the vegetarian in the group . desert was also phenomenal . top 5 % of meals ever !
asian	everything was wonderful with full flavor and the plating was pretty as well . my favorites were the fried taro app , khao sol noodles , and papaya salad . we ordered the mojito pitcher which was great . cute restaurant on church st with a full bar . very lively place .
asian	green curry , chicken pad thai , mongolian beef , spring rolls . only the cucumber salad was great but hot ! i
asian	everything we tried was good , especially their kimchi jeon pancakes . highly recommend this restaurant ! !
asian	my wife and i order take-out via grub hub on a regular basis . i get the pad thai with tofu and she gets the yellow curry with chicken and a side of rice . hands down , great food ! great delivery time and well
asian	what more could you ask for ? the shop is small and lovely , very bright , always bustling with people . they have a nice little patio to sit on in summer months , but get there early , it 's a popular spot . it 's close to our office , and we have ordered there at least twice a week for the last three weeks in a row . there 's always a big lineup , but it moves quickly and the staff get the orders out so fast . definitely worth waiting in line for .
asian	excellent service . make sure to get the bar seats . get everything in half order if possible so that you can try as much as possible . don 't forget to get mochi n lychee sorbet for dessert after the meals . prepare yourself , 60 minutes is plenty to get into foood cooooma . xd
asian	excellent service . the food is asian but with a modern taste . a good representation of good outside of the box food .
asian	exceptional service . our waiter larry took special care of us and even brought modified dishes for the two individuals at the table that had food allergies . highly recommended . we were a party of 20 and the waiter gave each one of us his undivided attention and he worked with the chef to honor every food request !
asian	this is our first time here and everything-from the ease of making a reservation , to the great decor and upbeat music to the impeccable fresh food and service and cleanliness exceeded our expectations . loved the pork belly , the kimchee rice , the crispy rice with spicy tuna , the crunchy roll , angry lobster roll were all incredible ! too bad the black cod was not on the menu tonight but the rest of the food made up for it . our server , adrian , was awesome . we had the best food and the best service . we will be back ! ! ! a true hidden gem !
asian	my boyfriend and i shared the hafa adai and it was so flavorful ! absolutely recommend this guam food experience !
asian	it 's cheap and there 's always leftovers , so i love visiting .
asian	fantastic flavors . unique experience . squid and vegetables is unforgettable .
asian	incredible service . one of the best chinese restaurants in the gta .
asian	fast , fresh and healthy ! this is my sec d time and i cannot stress how fast and fresh as well as tasty that everything is !
asian	the general tso 's is by far the best i 've had . sadly , closed on mondays though .
asian	fast service great meat loved the korean kalbi and bulgogi . nice atmosphere and pretty good bathroom . one of the best korean places i 've ever been to . a treasure of vegas !
asian	fast service ! ! the all you can eat is a great value ! ! we had so much fun trying out new rolls . i will definitely be back ! !
asian	first time here and was definitely impressed ! whole family loved it ! ! can 't wait to come again ! ! !
asian	first visit ever and didn 't think it would be this good . make sure to try the kobe beef
asian	fish is fresh . pick what you want from the ice and they cook it ! large portions . expertly cooked . served with hot roll and large house salad . not much to look at from outside but please come in . also they deliver . low prices .
asian	truly a diamond in the rough . 2 amazing dinners for under 30 dollars with leftovers for tomorrow . amazing service and exceptional food . it may be made to order but based on presentation and taste .
asian	lingua , shrimp , ribs you want it they 've basically got it .
asian	love the interior finishes .... very clean and creative . the fry tofu is a must try .
asian	props to the chef nuit regular for bringing her a-game to this restaurant . if you like thai food this is the place to go ! and if you aren 't sure about thai , try this and you 'll learn you love it ( most north american thai food doesn 't even come close to this ) .
asian	you can get an entire bowl of noodles and meat for only $ 10 approx . the service is decent but i wouldn 't say spectacular oh , it 's the food that really makes this place nice as well as the ambience . we have continuously come here for a cheap dinner which is also delicious . i would recommend this place to friends and family .
asian	you know the place is good when there is a half block lineup outside ! my korean friends love it too which says a lot !
asian	i love the cucumber salad they start you off with . the bento box is also awesome . it 's great if you want just a little bit of everything and at around $ 8 , it was well worth every penny . their sushi alone is also amazing . it feels more like a traditional japanese restaurant compared to other restaurants in champaign . i 'll definitely be back !
asian	you either get marinated meat that is really tasty and perfectly cooked , or a stone bowl with sizzling stuff that is a bit spicy and delicious , or a soup that is literally bowling and looked great . that restaurant located in a basement offers a great surprise . the bulgogi are simply fantastic . i always end up having that mixed bowl with the egg . and it is good . you see , that 's what i look for in a restaurant . authentic food , awesome taste , cheap prices , discoveries . definitely worth going to .
asian	amazing food , for those of you who like spice make sure you get higher then a 5 ( goes up to 20 )
asian	for what you get , it is an amazing price : ) full 7 course meal with huge variety and all delicately made .
asian	fresh and great chef ! if you want lunch show up early . the line had 10 people already at 10 : 30am . it 's worth the wait .
asian	fresh and tasty . great service . great value . great renovation too . after moving to leslieville over a year ago the only thing i missed of my old hood ( the annex ) was the variety of awesome and cheap sushi restaurants . finally ! one that not only compares but maybe even surpasses them . loved the crazy $ 10 lunch i just had . crazy bento with sushi and spicy beef gyoza sesame noodles soup salad and tea . boy am i happy . enjoy neighbors ! every day a place like this opens my neighborhood gets better and better !
asian	fresh to order tho . yor order will take 10 to 15 min depending on time of day . curtious and friendly staff.if you don 't mind waiting you will get great tasting food .
asian	fried fish and roti are a must try . if you haven 't tried malay food it is a cross between chinese and indian cuisine ... just like the people . craving it now .
asian	good service , and the servers know the menu well . everything was worth the price . i 'd definitely get the wagyu beef , korean barbecue ribs , tuna and salmon tataki , and black sesame ice cream when i go back . an instant favorite .
asian	friendly employees . reminded me of this thai restaurant in hollywood , ca . called sanamluang cafe . thai st . cafe is nice and clean . there tum yum medium spicy is what you call spicy . there thai tea with boba is so worth having even with out the boba . the funny part was the location it cracked me up it 's next to strip clubs . but totally worth going .
asian	friendly , knowledgeable staff . we stumbled on this gem after a movie and were so glad we did . great mix of korean bbq and sushi . we tried it all and it exceeded ours expectations . great place for a large party or a date . nice tvs and bar to have a drink and watch the game . def worth a look .
asian	we came for dinner on a friday night and found it almost empty upon arrival . as we went through our delicious meal it got more crowded , but the attention from our waiter never wavered . he always made sure our waters were full and our food was being enjoyed . we had the pad thai , panang curry , and chicken skewers app . it was more than enough food for our family of 3 , and we enjoyed every little bit ( and we have leftovers to continue enjoying it tomorrow ! ) we cannot wait to try more menu items on our future visits .
asian	the best thai food i 've ever had . the cashew chicken is absolutely amazing . all in all , a great , small , family run restaurant .
asian	friendly service . a very clean and welcoming place . the best indian food i have tasted . what else do u need ! * the chicken samosa is to die for *
asian	the california roll and the dragon roll are by far the best on the menu
asian	these guys win awards for a reason . service can get a little tricky around lunch and diner but for how busy they get its totallly understandable . chicken pakora , chili chicken , manchurian chicken fried rice and some wonton soup , so good for such a great price .
asian	full of flavor , well balanced , good customer service . fish salad was my favorite ! seafood pho did not taste like it was full of sudium !
asian	get the pot stickers and the chicken and broccoli dish ! probably close to my favorite chinese food place next to my house ! ( : i recommend trying them !
asian	good atmosphere . crab wontons and mongolian steak are so good ! portion size and price are on point . i eat multiple means per day and typically large plates . the small portions are more than enough for lunch . also had the wasabi crunch roll which was really good . all the perks of pf chang 's but with a fast casual dining experience . order at the front and they bring your food . no waiters / waitresses , you leave your plates on the table . great lunch restaurant model .
asian	we had kang keo wan ( green curry ) & pad kee mao , both with chicken . huge portion for the curry , plenty of leftovers . great fresh vegetables . spice level options 1-7 . good drinks , fast service . 2 happy hour drinks , an appetizer , & 2 entrees : $ 42 = very satisfying first visit . we will return .. frequently .
asian	good for sushi lovers as well as non sushi lovers . the crab dip is a great appetizer . the bento box offers you a good mix of everything- a little burger , some sushi , and some sides . they also have some awesome specialty rolls- the fillet mingon roll was amazing ! the only downside is that there is no reservations . i guarantee its well worth the wait though !
asian	good portions and good quality . the owner needs to hire more people to reduce waiting time . he 's usually working by himself .
asian	amazing food good service only downfall is it 's small and run down a bit uncomfortable sitting right up on the next tables guests
asian	you get to customize the spiciness of the dishes . additionally , the various vegetables were tastefully seasoned and cooked so they had a very nice texture . will definitely be back ! !
asian	amazing food .... great ambience ... lovely staff .... this is my second visit to pittsburgh and i made sure to have their delicious food on the very first day : ) we loved the spicy noodles , veg dumplings , basil fried rice and red curry ! !
asian	bubble teas are awesome more than not . i highly recommend this place to eat !
asian	great and friendly service . we had the chicken and beef combination bento . both the chicken and beef were cooked perfectly ... so tender and juicy ! the house-made mustard sauce pairs great with the beef ! we will definitely be back the next time we are in town !
asian	waitress picked every dish for us and was very knowledgeable about the food and ingredients . owner / chef is very passionate about his restaurant . definitely go back each time i visit .
asian	many korean bbq places around the vegas area tend to be small and always packed , but this place looked high-end and had very affordable prices . all of the food was delicious and the servers were very attentive . the only thing that i would recommend for improvement is that the meat sticks very easily to the grill making everything burn very quickly .
asian	we eat thai food all the time and we know many thai restaurants in the valley . orchid garden is one of the best . fresh cooked food , excellent food quality . restaurant is very clean , table settings are really nice - cloth table napkins , nice quality silverware , clean glasses ( yes this is really not a standard in many places ) we will be back . papaya salat was absolutely awesome , tom kha gai soup delicious and spring rolls made fresh and tasted great .
asian	amazing food great atmosphere and good service fresh sushi and great prices definitely recommend you to stop by and enjoy good food ! !
asian	james was our server and he knew everything there is to know about korean bbq , he kindly guided us through every single detail and suggested us the best combos because it was our first time . we are avid costumers of gyu kaku and always pick japanese over korean bbq , but this place was so good we will definitely be back !
asian	highly recommended . price is higher but worth every penny .
asian	great atmosphere ! tastes as authentic as it can get around here . i have been to nearly every thai restaurant in the east valley and this is my number one spot ! there 's a curry without coconut milk , very spicy ! that 's my favorite dish there . a medium tastes thai hot ! highly recommend this place !
asian	great customer service ! definitely a place to come back and visit if you love thai food . also , the perfect spot for those who love spicy food !
asian	husband & wife are always very pleasant and the food is always fresh , i recommend this place to anyone that wants authentic chinese food as a fast food
asian	love their tea btw ! price is reasonable . apparently yelp told me my review is to short so i 'm going to make it longer but by the time i think of something else i already made this review long . okay bye !
asian	i have been using the delivery service for years and have recently been eating in as well . it is a family operation , it is always clean , fresh ingredients in the food and everything has that little extra touch . highly recommended and well worth either a visit or a delivery order .
asian	great depth of spices and her nice helpful wait staff .... can 't drive past this one , and the pho ..... oh ya ! ! !
asian	great flavors and menu options . we have not had anything that was disappointing . favorite so far : crispy garlic chicken ! or the cashew chicken .... so many it 's hard to decide .
asian	lighting and layout is cool too . finally another nonbbq korean restaurant . they will be awesome once they start serving alcohol too
asian	great location with an incredibly authentic feel . my wife and i followed our waiter 's recommendation and it was well worth it . i can 't think of words to describe how great this place is for a nice quiet date . i would recommend you ignore these bad reviews . the waiters are charismatic and i 'm guessing these people have thin skin . their charm is half the fun . same with my barber shop : all the bad reviews are people who don 't have personality . i 'll be back many more times
asian	it 's my new favorite restaurant ! i don 't even ask for specific food anymore , i just tell them to give me something awesome cause it 's all good !
asian	great portion size with reasonable prices as well ! was my first time and the employee was very helpful and friendly in guiding me through the " build your own " process . will definitely be returning !
asian	great presentation ! atmosphere is really inviting , really comforting.definitely a place i would go with friends !
asian	hands down , this is one of my favourite ayce sushi places in the markham area .
asian	i 'd happily come here again . get the paneer pakora . it is excellent !
asian	was highly recommended by a friend . we sat at the bar because the seats were reserved ( reserve ahead of time ! ) . the staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating . the squash fritters were amazing ! ! ! very delicious . khao soi with chicken was very very very good . the chicken satay skewers were pretty good , but the peanut sauce made it extra good . and the pork belly sausage was delicious . would definitely come again ( especially for those squash fritters ! ) . my friend recommended to get the sticky rice along with the meal , so definitely going to get that the next time i go .
asian	great prices ! extra large servings and unique large different menu with a creative twist to all dishes different than all sushi places around here ! ! !
asian	what more can you ask for ? i love the mandarin chicken and the homemade ice cream . asian fusion at its best .
asian	they split some portions so that we can share , they were very helpful in suggesting items that we may want to try , and no one had a bad thing to say about the food . if you are at a teppanyaki table , it 's great , and watching the chefs prepare the food is fun . the rest of the resto could use a little updating . will definitely return .
asian	amazing food great prices ( happy hour ) nice environment friendly atmosphere , definitely enjoy the fresh sushi and beef teriyaki , now serving imported beer
asian	great prices ! the owner , ryan is super friendly and customer oriented . everything is authentic and made fresh . it 's the perfect little bistro conveniently located just across the street street from the charleston csn campus . everyone should eat here !
asian	great quality ! after eating from here i have never been able to eat thai food from anywhere else ! ! it 's a must go place and i 'd recommend this place to everyone
asian	5 stars for this place the fish tank adds a great touch for the kids . really enjoy eating here . great day the thai way .
asian	they even brought us some teas and desserts to try , free of charge . large portions , and the food had some good heat . will definitely go again !
asian	amazing food , great service and fantastic experience highly recommend anyone who love indian & vegetarian food ! !
asian	i couldn 't ask for more from a restaurant . the place is decorated in a pretty cool way and the washrooms have thai language lessons looping on which is lots of fun . its also a great location cause you can go there before enjoying a show or going to a pub . honestly i can 't think of another thai restaurant in the city that meets every aspect of a perfect score like this one .
asian	this visit i we had the beef jerkey , tom yum goong soup , pad thai and duck salad . every dish had wonderful flavors and even the dish we ordered at a hot level 9 wasn 't too spicy . best dish of the night though was the beef jerkey , definitly a must try . decor of the restaurant was cute and very thai . everything was clean and neat and the wait staff were all very friendly , helpful and efficient . if you like thia food or want to give it a try this place is a must .
asian	the only negative is the décor and seating as it was recently a sushi bar . i didn 't get all dressed up to pay a couple hundred bucks to belly up to a sushi bar . ask for a table when you make the reservation .
asian	been going for years and never a complaint about the quality of food or service . the owners greet you , play with your kids , treat your kids , and gladly accommodate you . never rude how some reviews claim , it 's just how they are ... get ovaaaaa it ! ! will always be a customer of theirs as long as they are in business .
asian	enjoy from appetizers to dessert : ) the interior is amazing , great for a quite date , small but cozy , i get out here at least once a month or everyother month to try a new dish .
asian	my favourite dishes are the pad see ew ( well-seasoned rice noodles ) main and the grabong ( squash fritters ) appetizer . lines can get long to get in ( up to an hour ) so i 'd recommend making a reservation or coming on a weekday .
asian	fresh , delicious and affordable every time . north york 's best kept secret !
asian	the saigon egg rolls , papaya salad and yellow curry are sooo tasty !
asian	totally recommended . family owned biz the wife is the chef - will come back again and again
asian	go there ! their lunch special is one of the better deals in oakland . you won 't be disappointed with the cashew chicken .
asian	great service ! great price ! crispy garlic chicken is incredible , you have to try it ! the only downside to this restaurant is they don 't have the best location !
asian	great buffet for lunch and quick take out . i love this place !
asian	i can 't say anything bad about this place . so pleased i finally stopped in . i had the bento box , my partner had the combo sushi platter . awesome .
asian	all you can eat sushi is $ 21 before 3pm and $ 25 after that . the appetizers are delicious and several of them have toasted garlic chips that make them incredible . the service and vibe is perfect . it 's in a strip mall that looks like it won 't be good from the parking lot , but opens into a modern decor that feels fresh and welcoming . the waiters are very cool and give great service with a smile . i eat a lot of sushi and sushi koma definitely stands our as one of the best .
asian	i absolutely love eating here , chilli chicken and manchurian noodles are the best out of the menu i would say ! just writing this review makes my mouth water : )
asian	i really don 't know how they do it for $ 26 all u could eat . had all the star items , most the nigiri sushi and i must say , i 'm impressed , especially for the price , it 's kinda insane if u ask me . i was expecting old low quality crap sushi but far from that ! 100 times better than any japanese buffet ! will most definitely return ! ! ! update : been here again for our latest trip to vegas , awesome food , fast service , we love this place ! can 't wait to go back ! sit at the bar for even faster service ! wish u guys the best !
asian	great service ! ! ! i would recommend the green curry , its so delicious !
asian	great service . nice people . try the poki salad and the screaming orgasm ! save room for the tempura ice cream !
asian	i will never get pho anywhere else . the market that they are located in is great for shopping and browsing after a big meal . it couldn 't be better ... btw try the shrimp spring rolls ! yum !
asian	my favorites : papaya salad , coconut chicken soup and red chicken curry !
asian	sometimes they have a sitar guy playing . wooo !
asian	great service ! was on point ! can 't wait to try everything else on the menu this is going to be my new favorite go to korean restaurant with all my all time favorites on the menu !
asian	we had duck , won tons , calamari , bok choy , noodles , all these dishes were so yummy ! and also the fortune cookie dessert ! i highly recommend this restaurant , and the shopping mall it 's in is very nice !
asian	great staff . affordable pricing . i would recommend this place if you like thai food . best place in town . the thai scale is true to its numbers .
asian	great staff and the atmosphere is very comfortable ! ! ! here 's a shot of the sushi boat we ordered with our group . soo much sushi we had an extra plate ! !
asian	what more can you ask for . i normally go for the lunch special that 's a bit more budget friendly ... and i 'm always pleased !
asian	the food is always good , spicy when you want it , and always at the level you tell them . my generals chicken almost had me crying just the way i like it . also the manager and i got to talk abour how messed up the white privileged world is and how much it can suck to be a person of color in the states , especially as immigrants .
asian	more than value for money . for its price point , this deserves a 5 star rating .
asian	we had chicken fried rice , red curry & eggplant tofu . everything tasted so good . we are already planning to go back !
asian	had the chance to eat here while in town and loved every bite ! the pork belly buns were amazing and the oysters were so fresh ! i also tried the carpaccio , spring rolls , pho , and coconut ice cream . honestly , the food was so delicious that if i lived nearby i 'd make eating here a weekly ritual . great thanks to the owners and staff of the establishment .
asian	had the spicy chicken noodle lunch special , great flavors , great price super quick service . nice and clean restaurant . wonderful option downtown . service was prompt and friendly and lots of parking options nearby .
asian	have been coming here for 15 + years and the taste is the exact same , if not better ! ! ! !
asian	the owner and staff are increasingly friendly . food is delicious and fresh .
asian	have been there two times and they have not disappointed . portions are generous and delicious .
asian	have tons of selection . have hibachi , sushi , desert , salad and grill ! ! ! can 't try everything at one time . will comeback for the other food . the price is awesome . great place to eat .
asian	have tried quite a few malay food joints but this one stands out . place was very busy on a saturday lunch time but food arrived surprisingly fast . kicked off with some mixed chicken and mutton satay skewers and some fruit mocktails . the roti with mutton curry and the malay curry were awesome . ordered some more to take out for dinner too ! ! good friendly folks . definitely worth a few more visits ( although it 's about 40 miles from home ) ! ! ! !
asian	my boyfriend and i felt so welcomed and had a great meal and i would definitely recommend getting their delicious halo halo for dessert . i am for sure coming back again !
asian	try any of the beef dishes such as gai-lan ( chinese broccoli ) + beef for example . great ! lunch specials such as spaghetti meat sauce and macaroni are great as well
asian	i 've also tried the rom yin soup which was as sour as i like it . the servers was all kind . would say it is a great place to hang to either have a drink or share a meal with .
asian	my co worker is a vegan and the chef cleaned the hot plate off before cooking his tofu on it . i strongly suggest coming here . around noon it gets kind of crazy in there but the staff and facility can handle the rush . i suggest the chicken woth udon noodles and broccoli and get creative with the sauces at the end . the staff can help you but if you like to make your own go for it .
asian	service even better . main waitress is able to speak in different languages . think this place might have the best sweet and sour pork . their seafood dishes are all good too . super good and quick service . i 'm usually here with my family and get the waitress to recommend dishes of the day . never disappointed !
asian	we have been three times now and we are never disappointed . we have ordered the corn pizza , jap chae , bulgogi , short ribs , ufo rice and a few other meat dishes . we have not done the cooking at the table part because the food is amazing . we crave this place once a week ! ! !
asian	amazing food here .. we have never been disappointed ... the prices are right and overall a great experience they don 't take debit wich is annoying but overall it 's great
asian	highly recommended . unlimited sashimi is the only way to go especially the cajun albacore
asian	highly recommend the shrimp wontons and the thai tea . we had the fried chicken and noodle and the hoi nam chicken and both were delicious . great service and very authentic food . and for the price ? you cannot go wrong coming here ! ! i will be back next time i 'm in vegas ! oh and don 't forget the sweetened roti !
asian	highly recommend this place ! best fried chicken in vegas ! perfect mix of spicy and sweet flavors with an hint of asian fusion ! must try ! !
asian	amazing food , high quality fish. and great service. the specials are great as well. will def come back again ( :
asian	they have this salad with raw salmon that 's basically sushi as a salad , and i 've been craving it since i was last there .
asian	honestly some of the best thai in all of montreal . location a little isolated but worth the travel . and not $ $ $ either . had the pad thai and crispy chicken with entree of dumplings ... well done ! a +
asian	honestly the freshest chinese food . like others have said- they have ruined chinese for me . they have raised the bar . amazing small family restaurant and always attentive and customer focused . will be back .
asian	howard you out did your self . we will be back . service was on point ; very attentive and wonderful recommendations . couldn 't have asked for better . food was the best i 've had . sushi was fresh and innovative . delicious ! ! ! can 't wait to go again .
asian	however , service is not always that great . i came in once , by myself , and the waiter kept looking at me like a fool .. after about a good minute , i asked to be seated , clearly making him look like a fool , he was a douche the whole time . second time i go , this time with someone , waitress was just apathetic .
asian	how is it that i have i never found you before now . food was wonderfully prepared and presented ! flavors were amazing and perfectly combined . perfect portions . prices are very reasonable . i will definitely be back again . i think i just found my new lunch spot !
asian	this place always provides great food and very quick service . food is brought out as it 's ready . sizzling plates are advertised , and the tea is great .
asian	huge portions ! great people ! i came in after 7pm after work , and ordered the mongolian beef . your choice of spicyness ! and like my fellow yelpers , they did not disappoint ! yes , it 's a whole in the wall and not the cleanest place , but the food and people more than make up for that ! if you truly are an asian food lover then you can not pass this place up !
asian	husband had the yakitori and he couldn 't say enough good things about it . i had the chicken schnitzel which was also very tasty . staff were lovely and service was quick . would definitely recommend and go back again
asian	the broth was 2nd to none , so i have found my new favorite soup spot .
asian	i always take my family here when they come to town and my sister lives it here . ! i could eat here all the time . i would definitely recommend this place for anyone .. but when you walk inside it smells a little weird lol but i goes away
asian	i am a huge japanese / sushi fan . i 'm from chicago where we have lots of similar asian fusion places and this definitely meets my expectations . the service was just ok . the waitress was a little snotty . the place was very very dark and very very very loud . lots of loud groups chanting and screaming . good meal though
asian	i am not a huge fan of raw fish but my 2 asian friends from vancouver are and they were in awe over the delicious sushi . the guys behind the counter kept starring at our table . .. like non stop and whispering to each other . not professional so minus 1 star . you can 't go into a restaurant of that calibr pay a $ 500 bill for 3 girls while having 3 teenage boys employees whispering and starring at ur table.the whole time . get ur little boys in line park ! keep up the amazing japanese cuisine !
asian	i cannot avoid coming here . i can be craving something else but as soon as we get nearby we end up coming here . i love the kalbi ribs , kimchi spam fried rice , and spam musabi . their oxtail was not bad either . when it comes to dessert their coco puffs are delish , malasadas are yummy , and butter mochi is addicting . they had a pumpkin mochi in october that was amazing . i highly recommend this restaurant , especially those who haven 't experienced hawaiian food ( like this canadian ) .
asian	i have been here several times and had several dishes all are great and there rice is always cooked perfectly .
asian	i can 't say enough . it stays fresh until your next delivery and literally tastes like no other . perfect customer service and the proportions are perfect . highly recommended .
asian	i come here during lunch time and always get the panang curry with vegetables . the soup they bring when you sit down is delicious , the veggies are always fresh and the curry is perfect . five stars ! !
asian	it 's a family owned business and the food here is really spot on . fair warning though , it is way spicier than typical spice scales . a 5 / 10 is brutal , so always ask for less spice than usual , you can always add more spice . the tom kha is absolutely amazing , so is the pad kra tiem . i go here all the time and i 've never had a bad experience !
asian	i don 't even like sushi but this is on another level . as the four dollar signs indicate it 's pricey .
asian	i don 't know how to describe my experience . as it was already pointed out the dining experience is personalize . the chef came to see us and she was an absolute gem . but the best part , obviously , was the food . such an amazing experience . extremely tasty , fresh food . there was so much taste in each bite . i hope to be in town one day again
asian	i eat here probably once a week ! the service is great in the restaurant and the take out is always fast and easy !
asian	amazing food , if you where to get something like one of the ten dollar dishes from here in downtown you " de be payin anywhere from 30 $ to 60 $ great value
asian	i got the grilled steak teriyaki today with salad . steak is tender and yummy ! always consistent quality and service ! highly recommend .
asian	i had a fun time with family and friends for my birthday ! the service was great and quick . i recommend it if you would like to try new things .
asian	i had spring ramen it was amazing and the pork belly bun was amazing . it was so good that changed the taste of the sriracha sauce , we asked the waiter what king of sauce was that ? ! nice experience .
asian	i had the number 15 with sliced beef and beef brisket couple of jalapenos in the rest of the veggies thrown in there and man was that good . it comes in a big bowl filled with the delicious stuff and my only complaint is that the bowl could be bigger
asian	i have had just about everything on the menu with the exception of their soups and man fantastic . this is definately one of my favorite places .
asian	i have had the chicken roti , jerk chicken with rice and peas , fried chicken , all the soups they have ( chicken foot , beef , chicken ) which all were delicious . the owner is a great guy super friendly and an amazing chef you can really taste the passion . my boyfriend and i come here often we play chess , watch some television , and enjoy free wifi . i recommend this place to everyone . so delicious .
asian	i have never waited more than 45 minutes for rolls and thats only when it is jam packed . i don 't mind the wait though because i know all the roll are being made individually , by hand , to order . thats rare these days . tons of options , including gluten free and i have seen some amazing veggie rolls come out of that kitchen . the menu is large but the servers that i have had seem to know the menu very well and can usually help aim you in the right direction to something you will enjoy ! never had a roll i didn 't like . favorites : flaming sexy steeler pleaser psycho fiesta
asian	i haven 't eaten in the restaurant , but i 've had take-out many times and it 's the best ! definitely always craving it ! for recommendations , look at the pics attached .
asian	i live right around the corner and it 's delicious chinese food for an awesome price . i got the combination c which i never finish . it 's fried rice with sweet and sour chicken balls , chicken chow min and an egg roll .

asian	i love it ... perfect and fast service , my fist time here and i will be definitely back for more sprig rolls
asian	i love thai and this was worth it . great atmosphere , short wait , great food , great price ! will be back .
asian	i love their kadai chicken . i recommend getting it spicy if you can handle spicy food . it 's heavenly . no wonder they are called curry garden . the place is definitely run down and hole in the wall . i rarely see ppl dining inside ... hope they will stay afloat ! because their food and service is top notch .
asian	i love their panang chicken . i like to add pineapple to it and it makes it delightful . their lunch chicken special is also very good , and great prices ! highly recommended place for thai food in the scottsdale area .
asian	amazing food ... i love the thai style wings and pad thai : )
asian	i love this place . theyre so fast but the quality is top notch . nice staff and menu selection . highly recommended .
asian	i 'm a bit of a sushi snob i admit , but i loved loved looooved this place . every roll was so good and i love the tasting menu concept ! will definitely come back
asian	the chicken are so fresh and the garlic sauce is delicious that adds good flavour to the meal . i would get anything that has chicken and ask for extra garlic sauce . i will always come back !
asian	i 'm from out of town and my aunt recommended this place and it was soooo good ! ! i will defiantly be coming back when i 'm in town ! ! ! they were fast and very polite over the phone . they even give us a treat which are these yummy sugar donuts ! !
asian	i 'm so pleased being here at comfort eating such incredible food . very impressed and will recommend friends and family to come here along with date nights
asian	i 'm still craving that panzorotti i has here . so delicious . i also had a rice ball which is very good as well !

asian	if you like sushi , short ribs , excellent sake drinks , this is your place .
asian	incredible prices . the friendliest service . my boyfriend and i are addicted . the kung pao chicken is amazing . get the dinner combo if you dine in or delivery is fast and you can tell the food is fresh and still steaming when you open it . highly highly recommend . 10 stars if i could ! ! ! !
asian	incredible service . love this place and it has such a wonderful dining area . small but nicely decorated and quant . you would never think to look where it 's located , in a small strip mall off taylor , just west of cedar ; but there it is and the food is divine . i can 't wait to go back again !
asian	incredibly helpful staff . i booked their family style room for a birthday party and they couldn 't have been more helpful . the food was amazing , the staff was amazing , the chef came out to chat with us - they accommodated our many food quirks - really fantastic ! thank you guys !
asian	rolls were thick and tasted fantastic ( ordered the dreamer roll ) , thai food was also incredible ( ordered the green curry and the pad thai ) . staff was also very nice , and threw in some free spring rolls and desert .
asian	the line was long for indoor so we sat outside and got it to-go . the patio was nice and it was good for people watching . dishes that stood out to me : tom yum soup mix curry thai salad !
asian	i never thought vegetarian food can actual taste better than meat dishes , and i love any food with meat ! my boyfriend and i love the avocado fried rice and the spicy szechuan tofu .
asian	in house made kimchi , amazing favors as soon as you step inside the restaurant ! good size-plates for less than you would expect ! my favorite lunch place !
asian	the restaurant has a variety of items other than pho . the list of appetizers has a great choice to start with . this place also offers a great list of juices and smoothies . lots of seating , very spacious , clean and very friendly waiter . definitely returning back .
asian	the samples sure do sell ya ! this is my first time and won 't be my last . the food has interesting ( great interesting ) mixes of asian and mexican cuisines . way to go chino !
asian	i only wish i was closer : ( ... you do have to get their attention a lot to keep your food coming but that is no big deal . they are busy . i get it . it 's fun cooking your meat and the prices are not bad at all .
asian	i ordered for pick up and the food was hot and ready on time and the employee was super polite and helped me cash out really quick . i ordered the mattar paneer roti and the butter chicken roti . they were so delicious ! the portions were enormous so i had enough left over for lunch the next day . the food is definitely worth the price . the interior feels like a food court but it 's easily forgiven considering the food is delicious . hopefully management will make efforts to make the dupont location look more fancy !
asian	i ordered the garlic lovers main with shrimp . it was delish !
asian	i ordered the sukho pad thai . really flavourful and extremely large portion ! perfect balance of noodle to sauce . my friend ordered the khao soi noodles and she found that there was a lot of curry broth relative to the noodles . customer service was spectacular . the waitress came back every now and then to ensure our glasses were filled with water . the restaurant was dimly lit . i felt that it could have been a little brighter . otherwise , no real complaints .
asian	i really like the vermicelli with beef with a side of pork chops . has been a favorite for years .
asian	food is authentic and inexpensive , the staff is wonderful , and the interior is well decorated . i enjoyed every aspect of my experience here and will come again !
asian	my husband and i stumbled upon this gem while searching for a place to eat . we ordered the spicy herbs spring roll as an appetizer , which made us instantly want to order more of them . they have just the right amount of veggies and meat . the wrapping was not hard or chewy which is a problem we usually run into . i ordered the tofu soup as my entree and it was reminded me of growing up and eating soup that my parents made me when i wasn 't feeling well . very simple with so much flavor . my husband ordered the pad thai with chicken and it was just spot on . best thai food in las vegas .
asian	it actually exceeded our expectations . each dish was full of unique flavors , everybody was very satisfied ! prices were higher than i expected but the food was worth it .
asian	it has been so far my favourite japanese restaurant in toronto . we tried the noodles with vegetables , spicy tuna roll , signature roll and tempura , and everything was fresh and delicious ! ! the place is very small , but that 's part of the charm ...
asian	it is a small place so don 't expect anything grand . food made to order and it does take some time for your food to come out . so if you are in a rush for quick lunch i would not recommend . but if you want great food and have some time to wait , i highly recommend this place . i 've never been disappointed , unlike some other reviews .
asian	it is comparable to my mom 's cooking falafel is incredible . the owner is so friendly - the restaurant is clean and tidy and food is delicious . def recommend .
asian	im having fun going and trying different things on the menu . a must try for all who want to tantalize their taste buds ..... a plus .... michelle
asian	the owner personally comes to your table an explains why it 's asian / greek , very sweet woman . can 't recommend it enough .
asian	it 's fresh and so tasty ! ! my husband and i wanted to try this place before but it was closed ( closed on sunday ) . just stopped by today to grab lunch on the go and glad we did ! ! we can definitely call this place a go-to for food . love the fact that you can grab a variety of food instead of just one item . small place but big in taste ! ! !
asian	it 's fresh , super flavorful , creative , and filling . the flavors are well balanced and addicting . i do not usually like indian food but this is something much better . i cannot say enough about the chef specialty items and the indian chinese fusion . the french fries that come with the wrap are like a funnel cake french fry . try try try ! ! ! the restaurant is clean and modern . we will be back very soon !
asian	i usually buy the wraps , which look like burritos ! they have lamb in them and they have the perfect amount of heat ! very inexpensive and so good ! highly recommend if your in the markham and steeles area !
asian	i 've been coming here for years . the servers are very polite and attentive . my favorite is the tandoori shrimp so much flavor in one bite ! the lam curry is also to die for ! !
asian	the sushi is amazing and always fresh and the sushi chefs are amazing friendly and always energetic ( if u do go to the sushi bar ask for john and don 't be shy he 's one of the bests .
asian	i 've been going here since before they relocated . the reason i only have 4 stars is because the service is just mediocre . but the atmosphere is awesome . i recommend the walnut chicken salad . hands down best thing on the menu !
asian	i will definitely be a regular . the staff was super nice , food was reasonably priced and the portions they gave were very generous . will be back for sure !
asian	i would definitely go back . had the pan seared chicken and it had a lot of flavour . the place is cozy but the food is nice .
asian	i would recommend people to come here ! so tasty ! apart from the good food , the service and deco is nice ! ! !
asian	i would say just as delicious as the other sushi burrito place in town . if i had to make one suggestion to the owner , get the customer flow down a bit better . walking in and having a long line weave in and out of tables is a bit awkward . just designate an ordering flow to make it organized . overall verdict : will be back probably next weekend .
asian	juicy chicken . won ton soup is so tasty . cute lady that runs the place may seem a little rough around the edges but she 's the sweetest thing ! ! ! ! prices are so reasonable . def try this place ! ! ! ! !
asian	just moved into the area and was looking for our chinese place of choice , and we found it on the first try . their food was amazing . they have a great selection and really good prices , and to top it off a wanton egg drop soup , which is the best of both worlds !
asian	khao soi beef is classic . the soups are excelent ( and a full meal )
asian	they gave me a 20 % off card . we definitely came back
asian	the service and atmosphere is also really welcoming and enjoyable .
asian	large portions ! nice atmosphere ! excellent prices too ! i haven 't been there for a few years because i moved but wow ... still as good as ever ! ! ! ! general tsao tofu ... even the non tofu eaters loved it ! ! ! !
asian	lena our server was great ! ! you can try a lot because they offer half rolls ! we will be back : )
asian	delicious , always come here especially since it 's right around the corner . as far as finding the store is a little difficult .
asian	literally any dish here is great . been eating here for about a year now and it is one of the best places . if it is your first time , try the khao soi , it will blow you away . service is stellar , food is great , people are nice . it 's a little small and theirs usually long lines , but its well worth the wait !
asian	literally could not finish because the portions are so big ! i recommend everything seriously and the red bean boba is incredibleeee ! !
asian	everything i tried tasted amazing . wait staff were really good about clearing un-wanted plates and re-filling water . i just wish i had a bigger stomach so i could try everything .
asian	loved all of it -- beef rendeng , papaya salad , chicken satay , spring rolls , laksa soup with chicken -- and will certainly be back for more !
asian	loved the delivery service , online ordering was so easy . oh , absolutely in love with their chicken wings !
asian	loved the golden curry chicken , coconut rice , and samosas . went during the jazz festival , could here it in the nice outdoor patio .
asian	loved the tigers milk ceviche & meat platter . the place is in a house , nothing flashy or fancy . small space but cozy . so lively on a thursday night ! decor was really nice , dark ambience .
asian	love love love this place . the pho broth is delicious , the pork chops , the noodle bowls the pad thai - you seriously can not go wrong with anything on the menu . highly recommended !
asian	love the combination of sushi and burgers . the bento box is definitely the way to go . only gave 4 stars because it 's pretty pricey .
asian	love their spicy tan tan if you can handle spice . great atmosphere , but they recently had a price hike so that 's where the 1 star
asian	amazing food love there subs ( ask for extra spicy ) has been a great place to eat at for many many years !
asian	it 's so classy , beautiful decor , and the food is phenomenal , so delicious . i love this place , i highly recommend .
asian	lunch buffet is very good and dinner menu . wonderful service as well . highly recommended .
asian	i went with a friend and we are both pretty fussy and both very pleased ! we are both vegans with food allergies . yum !
asian	mussels are deeelish ! great service ! i feel bad for not remembering the name of our waitress but she was always smiling , and that 's so refreshing nowadays ! the place is small and could use better table placing b / c we felt cramped . but overall , love this place ! definitely telling friends and will be back !
asian	must try the spaghetti pad ki and crispy pork belly . food is good every time i have ordered from here , which is quite frequently . friendly and quick service .
asian	my bf and i were craving some authentic chinese food for dinner . after looking at some of the pics on yelp we decided to try out their mapo tofu and fried fish with spicy sauce . yes they were both spicy but not just spicy the flavor was there . my bf was in hunan china a few years ago and said that their food is authentic . i 've never been to china to compare the real chinese food but all i can say is their food is a must try ! ! ! !
asian	my chinese coworker went here after work because she said it was one of her favorite chinese restaurants in town . this restaurant quickly went up to my go to chinese restaurant to go to
asian	i had the masaman curry and she had the thai basil sauce both delicious . we will definitely have to come here again and try other items .
asian	amazing food my friends jim and carol know the owner and the food is authentic hawaiian
asian	my husband and i were looking for a good chinese place and this definitely hit the spot . we got the pork fried rice , sweet and sour chicken , beef and broccoli , and walnut shrimp . it was a lot of food and i ate way too much but i couldn 't stop eating it was just too good ! definitely recommend .
asian	i 've tried everything on the menu and the kentucky fried fish and pork belly are my two favorites . the salad is super fresh and the wasabi ranch mixed with one of the other dressings is superb . everything is cooked fresh to order in 5 minutes or less with fresh ingredients made from scratch . the rice bowl is becoming addicting as i am now starting to crave a bowl at least weekly . a must try if you haven 't yet .
asian	my wife and i split garden rolls for an appetizer . good start ! ! ! i had street noodles # 2 and really enjoyed it . my wife had the pad tai . we both shared our food and they offered to bring plates out . we brought our own bottle of red wine . unfortunately we dud not have room for desert , but the choices sounded great . we both walked out with full bellies and two little to-go boxes . we 're definitely coming back .
asian	asian fusion . we always have a good meal and the atmosphere is warm . the staff treat us very well . they have an upper deck and cafe style seating in front as well . my favorite is the lobster monkey roll ! ! ! ! ! it 's a must have every time ! ! ! ! !
asian	nice staff . pretty fast ! even though i 'm starting to not have sushi or take out foods that much anymore this place is always the one that pops up in my head when i think of sushi . thank you
asian	we gor the veggie tempura and potstickers for apps . then as entrees we got the spicy pumpkin basil w pork and the sweet thai sausage . i honestly almost couldn 't stop eating the sausage it was that yummy . our drinks were our desert we got coffee milk tea and thai tea both w delicious honey infused boba . come here any chance you get it worth the trip
asian	noodles were perfect level of spice . may have over indulged in the dumplings . top notch . highly recommend .
asian	not a very significant difference between small and large size dishes . i ordered small , my friend ordered large , we were both feeling pretty full by the time we were done eating .
asian	our lyft driver asked us how we found out about this place because he usually drives locals there . we heard from another driver that this place was worth it . he wasn 't lying .
asian	my gf of 7yrs went there with me on our first date for lunch
asian	one of the best korean spots in vegas . have always come here after the first time very happy with service and everything
asian	one of the best ramen spots i 've ever been ! i will definitely become a regular and drive the 30 minutes to get here !
asian	one star off for their slow kitchen . probably no one wants to work in the kitchen on a saturday night . my fourth time here and ... my favourite goes to the chicken liver and oyster pate ! ! ! !
asian	ordered a bunch of sushi and it was so fresh and nicely done . the service is also perfect . they have excellent attention to detail . priced great too !
asian	, inexpensive but cash only . great gem ! don 't be scared off by the location , its definitely worth the trip
asian	a must try if you like authentic chinese food .
asian	perfect late night spot for delicious food and laid back atmosphere . tried probably half the menu and didn 't come across one thing i didn 't like . definitely try the shiobiani steak , the bulgogi , and go for the quail eggs if you 're feeling adventurous .
asian	service was also exceptional , and the waiter really made his recommendations based on our inputs . we will definitely be regulars .
asian	the noodles are to die for ! ! we had a very nice experience . absolutely loved it . we sure will be returning on a weekly basis .
asian	i loved the soup , salad with peanut sauce and the chicken basil . great staff , service and top notch thai food .
asian	pokie bowl was great ! great service , would recommend to anyone that visits vegas ! ! you won 't regret it
asian	chef nakamori prepares each dish with love and care . the quality of food far surpasses anything else in scarborough . the food is always fresh , well presented and most importantly tastes amazing ! went again last night for the new udon with tempura lobster tail and nearly fell off the chair , thats how good it is . do yourself a favour and try this .
asian	the owner and his staff treated us like old friends and made us feel extremely welcomed . they even have real wasabi , not just the paste stuff you normally see everywhere . wasn 't expecting such high quality sushi , so i 'll be back many more times in the near future . if you are looking for hiro sushi quality without the high price and long wait , check this place out now !
asian	quality food . lot of varieties in buffet . not had this good buffet in recent times .
asian	servers were nice upon walking in . chefs were in pint with food prep and show . everything tasted fresh of that exact moment and not a day old . halibut was top notch and the orleans rolls is a must for the spicy lovers . goota come back quick . must visit ! ! ! !
asian	they are a little skimpy with the macaroni salad , which sucks cause it 's always my favorite on the plate .
asian	a perfect addition to ayrsley . the prices are very reasonable and they are great for dine in or take out . 10 / 10 highly recommend
asian	and it definitely didn 't break the bank . oh ya , and they got sesame balls ! ! ! we will definitely be back !
asian	quick wait time when picking up . the pho is my favorite . watch the spicy levels though .
asian	my second time having korean bbq , i will definitely return my next trip to vegas . pork belly was the best ! !
asian	strongly recommended . and a uniq social expiriance : just go a head an order the saka-bomb ; - )
asian	really enjoyed the complexity of these dishes . very unique and the service was fantastic . i 'll definitely return here again !
asian	really love the chicken pho here and the fried rice is so good . the service is amazing here , the owner will customize your order to perfection ! friendly service and really homely vietnamese food . come here regularly and have always had a excellent experience ! it 's a bonus because they open till 4 am ! great for late night meals . can 't wait to come back again !
asian	reasonable prices ! ! ! ! and .... awesome owners . we go there at least twice a week . make sure to check out the " today 's highlights " for daily specials on their website . when we call for an order to go at lunchtime ( no matter how much we order ) it 's ready and it 's right even with substitutions . love this place : )
asian	reasonably priced . i would come back here again . excellent service and sushi was fast .
asian	reccomend pho soup ! not with the beef it comes with though , that meat was disgusting ! minus the meat it was amazing .. mongolian beef was great as well ! i felt the plates were pricey for being very casual dining , also didn 't serve you that much meat . great service , friendly & upbeat ! would reccomend !
asian	ryan , the owner , watches over every aspect of service and makes superb table side service recommendations . two of us shared six plates . the beef short ribs , 30-hour pork sous vide , black bean noodle soup with perfectly poached egg and beef tacos were amazing . my husband had the sea bass surf and turf and said he would have that again when we come back . get here before this place breaks out and it 's a 45 minute wait for a table !
asian	salmon carpaccio was my fave , the truffle oil with the salmon is the right combination . the crab mango salad was a great starter , such a fresh taste , we loved the 808 roll and we also had the kalbi which was mouthwatering ! the only reason i 'm not giving it a 5 star is the environment is a little dull , more decor and just a little more island feel is needed . other than that the food was awesome ! ! !
asian	fried spam musubi was firm and crispy , our pork cutlet bowl with egg ( donburi ) was also flavourful , thou the pork cutlet was a little bit dry for our liking . we 're in love with panko fried soft shell crab ! it was fresh , crispy and it tasted exactly like real crab that they just got from the ocean just for me ! staff was friendly and attentive . they 're always willing to explain and answer any questions you have ! come before it get full around 1 pm !
asian	amazing food. seafood congee crave acomplished. new locaton. center point. enplug is awsome
asian	there 's no better place in madison for fresh vegetables
asian	seriously the best pakistani food in the gta . ordered the chicken and beef seekh kebab . came out fresh and soft . also got the palak paneer which was delicious . must try for anyone who loves pakistani cuisine . would encourage the service to be a bit better as we kept on having to get the waiter 's attention .
asian	we ordered green curry and chicken pad thai . both were equally awesome ! !
asian	to be clear this is almost exclusively a take-out joint , and a somewhat sad looking one at that , but don 't let the appearance fool you . the jerk chicken , rice and cole slaw are finer than you 'll find anywhere else in toronto . i recommend no gravy or gravy on the side . it 's tasty but ultimately masks the delicious jerk flavour .
asian	highly recommend the chicken karaage pizza , it 's amazing and unique
asian	best thai food ever ! the iced tea has steeped jasmine in it , delicious if you 're into trying something new ! we ordered red curry , larb salad , cucumber salad , pot stickers , fried spring rolls , and mango sticky rice and they were seriously all five stars ! ! ! new favorite thai in the area- oh and all fresh house made ingredients with white meat chicken !
asian	# 46 chicken pineapple fried rice , enough for left overs ! ! ! this will be one of my regular stops ! ! !
asian	so happy to have a new restaurant with a little flare . we got the fried cauliflower , shrimp boil , tuna poke wantons and gumbo ramen . everything was served in large portions , and tasted amazing ! the boil is definitely big enough for two people . highly recommend trying this place !
asian	very clean and am so glad i got to stop by ! thank you so much for the amazing and fresh pho , coffee and spring rolls ! ! ! !
asian	gio was our server at the time and he was very nice & attentive . he always made sure that my friend & i were taken care of . i have only been to sakana twice and i will be coming back often . great job sakana ( :
asian	i will not go to orchid garden on w. sahara ever again . the food was hot and fresh . the restaurant was so clean and lovely . we took the entire family and had a great time . a +
asian	my only gripe was that i wish they would slow down on the timing between nigiri courses do so i could savor each impeccable piece . it 's the best sushi i 've ever had ! * update : just did omakase at sushi yasuda this month in new york city and still thought this place was the best .
asian	the gyuma ( blood sausage ) is not to be missed and the beef lhasa momos were juicy and delicious . the ginger cardamom tea was lightly sweet and exquisitely aromatic . previous reviews were bang on about the chili chicken - it 's especially good dry with gravy on the side !
asian	loved it . will definitely go back . get a reservation though - it gets very busy on a weekend .
asian	all the staff here is joyfull and super polite . all dishes have its particularity and all very tastefull . i have been here so many times and never disppointed . you also have to try their cocktails its very original .
asian	amazing food , service , environment , drinks ( suggestions : take , sakura & hana ) and music .
asian	especially perfect for birthdays , anniversaries , or anytime you really wanna spoil your taste buds ! ! !
asian	it is my go to for chinese cuisine ! ! ! go there , you won 't be disappointed .
asian	the ario o & kimono rolls are to die for and the oyster shots , yummm ! can 't wait to go again !
asian	the crab fried rice & bbq pork were my favorite ! chicken panang & pad thai also very good .
asian	service was good overall but a little on the snooty side ( too stiff and robotic ) . very expensive food and alcohol ! ! then they expect a tip for the " captain " on the bill in addition to the gratuity for your server ... all the captain did was come over and tell us the specials .
asian	service was great . definitely ordering from here anytime i want chinese !
asian	i like the dim sum there and i tried the new release " crab and lobster on the rice . " still ， there are items i can 't wait to try.excellent ！ highly recommend . would definitely come back again ！
asian	service was ok , a bit slow . we always order the eggplant in hotpot , vegetable fried rice , sizzling beef with mushrooms and onion . 5 stars for the food !
asian	what more can you ask flavorful ramen options ! my boyfriend loves the cha cha cha one ! i personally don 't care for ramen but there other dishes to choose instead of ramen . they also have happy hour which is always a plus !
asian	sit down restaurant quality food at fast food prices . it 's not fast food , it 's great food fast . every dish they make is excellent , weather it 's hawaiian or asian . i go back all the time ! we sometimes get delivery if we get stuck at the office .
asian	small , quaint place . the tom kha soup was delicious . the ambience is cute and cozy .
asian	amazing food , so fresh so tasty , lovely service always count on quality food for great prices !
asian	amazing food , so many choices , reasonable prices , all around great place that i can 't wait to try for a second ( and third ) time !
asian	some of the best curry we have had ! so craveable & authentic ! !
asian	lots of vegetarian options . i highly recommend the vegetarian meal for two , you can even customize it and it is very affordable .
asian	if you see the waitress named kailin , ask for her !
asian	i can 't believe how delicious the meats were ! ! ! ! definitely coming back ! ! the staff was so helpful and nice ! my favorites we 're the jalapeño poppers , the spicy tuna kimbap , spicy pork , pork belly , korean chicken cheese fondue , and the spicy chicken with lemon sauce ! happy hour here is amazing ! !
asian	staff are very nice , fast service and they deliver now ! their asian pancakes are delicious , you must try it !
asian	stopped by here for our last meal on vacation and was not disappointed . everything was so flavorful , the red curry was the best i 've ever had ! my family members also got the tom yum soup and drunken noodles ( both fantastic ) . the owners were kind and personable , and made great conversation . they specified each dish to our liking with level of heat ! being from southern california , i 've had quite a bit of thai food and this was the best i 've ever had . i 'll be sure to stop by next time i 'm in arizona !
asian	stopped in for lunch today and the mango curry ( with an " adventurous " three-star spice level ) was incredible ! spicy and sweet with pineapple , squash , tofu , and potatoes , i left a very satisfied girl. actually , everything we had was fantastic , including the tofu soup ( served with the lunch plate ) and egg rolls ( ordered separately ) . fantastic food , reasonable prices , a super friendly server , and two charming chefs who still cooked lunch for us even though we wandered in just past closing time made this a remarkable lunch experience. if i lived in the area i would definitely take out-of-towners to this spot ( in between my own regular visits ) .
asian	stopped off for lunch while driving back home on vacation and we stumbled across this little gem . the servers were incredibly kind , attentive , and helpful ! their portions are huge , and the food was incredibly flavorful . i look forward to eating my leftovers tomorrow but will be sad when they 're out of my life .
asian	honestly reviews don 't lie , the prices were beyond reasonable . the staff was friendly and the food was delicious , don 't forget to try their sister company for incredible desserts
asian	such a quiet place in north brampton . authentic thai food , curries are amazing , can 't say enough about the soups either . my only wish is they had delivery or an apartment for me to rent upstairs .
asian	get the kimchi fries for sure . the braised beef bao and the kimchi fry bao ( off the secret menu ) are delicious ! i like these better than the squid or pork belly . the tacos are also pretty good but i prefer the baos .
asian	super friendly and knowledgeable owner and staff . great service . hers a few pictures . when things are this good , there is no need to write a super long review !
asian	sweet people . if you 're in the area , it 's well worth the visit . just say " omakase ... " they will take care of you .
asian	keep coming back for the incredible food , but one waitress in particular is just awful . recommend the khoi soi and thai ice tea . food is 5 / 5 every time i 've been here ( three times ) . worth the wait for the food . the waitress was so awful today i had to write this review . asked for my food to be packed up and she threw a take out box on the table and walked away . paid the bill and tipped and didn 't even get any " thank you " or small talk . in fact , she never came by to ask how anything was even once . hopefully she gets her shit together .
asian	their homemade soups are incredible ! they are family owned and everything is very reasonable . you gotta try it for dine it or to go !
asian	sheila , our server , took amazing care of us . the calamari was the most unique flavor combination of dipping sauce and seasoning that i have ever encountered . we tried all but 1 thing on the happy hour menu and our bill was about $ 60 and we were very full . the only thing lacking here is ambiance . definitely not a romantic date night spot or anything .
asian	there was a problem with one of our orders and the staff was very helpful . the food got to our table super fast and they even gave us free dessert for the trouble ! everything was delicious . great restaurant for a date .
asian	exceptional ingredients and service . in a city full of terrible thai restaurants and takeouts this is one of a handful of toronto 's finest . i 've never had a bad experience .
asian	the atmosphere and the service of the place was really comforting and welcoming ! the cleanliness was awesome ! definitely would come again
asian	we got their chicken 65 and paneer chili for appetizers , which were very very well prepared . for entree we got their lamb kadai , butter chicken , palak paneer and channa masala . i am usually not a fan of lamb at all , but i really enjoyed theirs . we got spice level 5 for everything . some dishes were spicer than others , but all within reason , with a good kick to them . the staff is very friendly as well . i would definitely recommend this place to everyone i know .
asian	the best pad see ew dish by far ! they are on northsight tucked behind salty senoritas , but worth the find ! its quite the gem . very clean and nice , and the owners are very hospitable ! very inexpensive compared to other thai restaurants , and the portions are huge ! i don 't even think i ate half my dinner . check it out !
asian	the service is a hit and miss but the quality of the food in my opinion makes up for it , especially as we 've never had service which could be considered horrid -- and i 'm only talking about this here because many people have commented on the service .
asian	the chicken corn soup is the best i 've had . the sugar beef is fantastic . they always treat us very well every time we come
asian	the chicken panang curry is good it 's not too runny or too thick and so flavorful . the mango sticky rice dessert is a must try also . the mangoes are fresh and its almost a whole mango that comes with it .
asian	the service is great ! will order take out again and again .
asian	amazing food .. the curries red / green and the home style tofu .. are great value for money !
asian	the dumplings are great and so are the side dishes they have . 4 / 5 for aesthetics inside is small , cramped , and dark . but they do have pick up and take away options !
asian	the food does not have any msg or fake ingredients . sabrina served us and she is great ! ! ! if you 're looking for a good affordable pho place , definitely check this place out !
asian	the food was all great , and everyone helping us was awesome . unlimited sashimi definitely a big plus
asian	the freshness and veggie friendly dishes makes this our go to thai place . great for a lunch or dinner .
asian	the grape rolls are so yummy . the pomegranate chicken is life changing ! and the pumpkin cheesecake is worth the drive !
asian	the harami miso , korean chicken cheese fondue and salmon with bacon were fantastic . will definitely visit again !
asian	it 's a shame aura doesn 't get enough traffic .
asian	their teriyaki chicken is incredible , best i 've ever had . they have great prices , are fast and always have chicken samples available if you want to taste it . they also offer dishes with noodles , shrimp and beef . you can get brown rice which is delicious and perfectly cooked and and sushi . if you want extra teriyaki sauce they will happily put it on which tastes particularly good over the rice . definitely a place everyone should try !
asian	) , and they aren 't afraid to bring the heat . i go between thai hot and a 4 / 5 ( i notice that it 's hotter when i 'm in person ) , and can 't go wrong with the pad siew , pad thai , or any of the curries ( the panang is stellar ) . oh , and they deliver !
asian	the kobe beef is so marbled and the banchan are perfect . they have teokbokki which i 'm obsessed with . perfect dinner !
asian	the lamb vindaloo is the best in town ! they are very accommodating when it comes to spiciness , so i can get my dish nice and spicy while my kids can get theirs more on the mild side . if you haven 't eaten here , you need to !
asian	the meats and sandwiches are amazing . better than places i 've been to that cost me hundreds . this place was so reasonable
asian	the medium hot is the perfect spice . the garlic nan is to die for . i highly recommend this place .
asian	the nice lady who was the cook was very welcoming , and recommended foods based on out party of 5 ( 2 adults , 3 kids ) . it is very neat and clean place . all the food choices were excellent . i am so glad we decided to stop by and try her food . very honest owners and the quality was food was very good . fresh , made to order food .
asian	the noodles are the perfect texture . love every dish i 've tried here . love that there 's a large open window to view the back kitchen to see a behind-the-scenes view !
asian	the only thing out of almost the whole menu we ordered that we didn 't love was our favourite was the ( not spelled right ) chung fun rice roll chicken and shrimp both fantastic . the black sesame tart dessert was great too . happy to pay the prices they charge here .
asian	the orange chicken & twice cooked chicken is fantastic ! comes out fast , fresh and hot ! any dinner plate you can make it as a combination for .50 cents more .. you get soup , crab rangoon , egg roll and fried rice . worth the money ! you will also have leftovers : ) the lunch specials are the best , super cheap and sooo much food !
asian	the owner is very gentle and his service towards loyal customers is great ! the food is always constantly delicious and there has been no flaws to point out regardless of the great number of times we have been there !
asian	the owner was super accommodating to our last minute request . i would highly recommend this restaurant . try the ismaili beef curry and the faloda for desert .
asian	the oxtail is unbelievable ! great service , cute small restaurant . i will be back !
asian	the pad thai was perfect ! if you are planning to eat here before a show at the mesa arts center then make sure you get a reservation because this place gets packed !
asian	it 's a great place for late night munchies and the reverse happy hour makes this place more than affordable for the quality of the food you get in return . most definately would recommend 10 / 10
asian	the price is very reasonable it is in a food court so best to get take away . with these prices and quality no other place can beat it !
asian	the service has alway been exceptional . this is the only place i 'll eat sushi . i highly recommend trying the " ting " with carrot ( unless you love fired onions ) or the try the " justin " it 's also amazing .
asian	the short ribs are a must try . bill was $ 200 with 6 drinks . service was excellent and they have pretty decent music .
asian	the soups were delicious . the service was exceptional . great prices and super accommodating for kids !
asian	the spicy chicken with cheese is delicious . can 't wait to go again !
asian	the spring rolls and the panang curry were delicious . very nice service . will definitely go back . more simple decore - not fancy but the food more than makes up for it ! recommended .
asian	the staff is incredible and always make us feel so welcome . the soup is fantastic and very authentic . just discovered this place about a week ago and have already been twice since then ! try this place if you love vietnamese food
asian	i wish i lived closer . i loved the soup and the pad thai , and so did my wife !
asian	the sushi was outstanding and fresh ! ! also had spicy crab rangoon and they had huge chunks of crab in them . we shared the udon noodle and those too had wonderful flavor . but by far my favorite was the hot roll ! ! ! !
asian	the taste and quality of each dish on the buffet is not what you 'd expect from a typical cheap buffet but more of a gourmet restaurant . i loved every dish i tried - chicken masala , naan , rice , paneer . too many great dishes to name ! the service is also spectacular . drinks refilled properly and servers were all genuinely nice to us . the only downside to the lunch buffet is that it doesn 't include samosas or the coconut dessert which both can only be found on the sunday buffet . regardless , i 'll still come back during the weekdays .
asian	the veggie burger is one of the best i 've had anywhere . good portions of totally fresh and tasty food . i tried the dish with shitaki shrooms , zucchini noodles and brown rice ... so delicious . chai tea is great . not being from charlotte the restaurant was a little tricky to find . it is set back from the street and next to a gym . it was packed at lunch but the service was good and speedy . go try this place !
asian	they also got one of those shoes off style tables ( which would be nice for parties ) things to get : -thai sausage platter - thai iced tea - curry oxtail will be back for more sampling
asian	they are the nicest people . they give you so much food . while you are eating they keep bringing more for you to try . everything we ate was delicious . we will be back before we leave town !
asian	they are very friendly and prompt . their sushi rolls are huge and delicious . definitely recommend it .
asian	they do make it spicy so order on the lower side of spice if you are not a fan . the food did take a long time to make though as other people have said . don 't be in a rush when you come here .
asian	they have awesome steamed egg , potato noodles , and sooo much good meat ! definitely come here when you can because they have amazing food !
asian	they use high quality meats and seafood . price is okay but well worth it considering it includes a show and experience . definitely will be back soon .
asian	this has to be my favourite hakka places ! scarborough knows how to do hakka . my favourite items are the chilli chicken ( dry version ) , fish pakora , crispy beef , manchurian noodles and singapore rice noodles . the staff are always very friendly and give great portions ! used to go to federicks / lin garden but now this is my go to place ! they also have really good lunch specials !
asian	this is about as good as you can get . the chefs plate was 60 pieces ... highly recommend the scallops which are raw and so good .
asian	amazing food this is by far my favorite chinese restaurant there 's so many options i recommend the chicken lo mien amazing
asian	the sushi is always prepared so well i get excited every time i go . the staff are great too , i had an issue and they handled it so well . my most recommended dishes : - salmon oshi - ebi oshi - o toro nigiri - avocado nigiri
asian	this was my first time here , and i was by myself so i only got to try the one dish , but it was the best pad see ew i 've ever had . positively stunningly good . packed with flavor , noodles almost a little caramelized , just the way i like it . also had the mango with sticky rice . had to try it even though i was stuffed . as good as i 've ever had . the place is tiny but with high ceiling and windows , so naturally bright . i knew when i walked in and saw the several smiling thai women working the kitchen that i was in for a treat . do not miss this place !
asian	those pineapple things by the noodles were to die for ! definitely my favourite . one thing i noticed was that the food wasn 't stocked all the way . i wanted tortellini pasta but it was empty and there was no one around to ask for more . waitress didn 't refill our waters right away , but it was a pretty busy night . for the price , the food was excellent . there was a great selection of things to choose from and the sushi and sashimi was super fresh ! would definitely eat here again .
asian	we 've become regulars over the past few months and this is now our family 's go to spot .
asian	try the dry chili beef-you won 't be disappointed . garlic chicken is also very tasty .
asian	try the panang curry . i 'd swim in it if i could . also , complimentary ice cream afterwards !
asian	unlike many indian restaurant which put oodles of oil and spices , this one cooks in authentic indian home style with required amount of oil and flavours.worth for money
asian	very authentic and tasty cuisine . the owner / operator is friendly and engaging . it 's a take out only shop , but worth the drive and the price . enjoy .
asian	very authentic . no msg or other filler that makes you feel off . service pleasant . dinning area is nothing special so be prepared to enjoy the food not the ambience .
asian	very authentic . the owner was eating behind us and made sure we got excellent service . my parents are from shanghai and loved the food so much , they want to return tomorrow !
asian	very authentic . the wings were bomb ! good portions , good price . definitely going back
asian	very clean . great chefs prepare food to perfection . tastes like a 5 star restaurant .
asian	and the price is so reasonable ! definitely worth the cab ride off of the stip .

asian	very fresh sushi and incredible rolls ! beautiful dining area and bar . such a treat and i 'm from california where the sushi is hard to beat ! you will love their menu ! some of the dishes are fried so just be sure to ask if you don 't like fried food ( which i don 't ) . you will not regret dining here and the service is great too .
asian	very friendly . our server even brought us soup before we ordered just as a welcome . this place is just wonderful . my husband and i were in town and had a craving for some pad thai and he found this little place on yelp . the sheer number of positive reviews had our mouths watering and we were not disappointed . the food and pricing were perfect for us . everything was served fresh and quickly . it was a good family made meal . we are going to be in vegas this next weekend and cannot wait to go back and visit !
asian	no msg used in any of their dishes , which is an absolute must for us . yet , the dishes are really authentic .
asian	they also offer very tasty ( free ) appetizer that most japanese restaurants used to offer . highly recommend ! ! ! also , a very unique and personalized touch : they offer ( regular ) customers to bring in and store their own chopsticks right by the entrance .
asian	by far the best indian food i 've tried . try the nepali chicken momos too . it 's a small place but very good food
asian	will definitely be back for more . soup dumplings are a must .
asian	very nice staff , which is a rare find in asian resturants . they are attentive and accommodating . dim sum and menu prices are very reasonable . will be returning on our next trip to vegas .
asian	i just move from chicago an i really need to find a place like this !
asian	be careful to get the right spice level , the food can be extremely spicy . server was very informative and excellent vibe in the restaurant . it 's a definite must if you 're a fan of thai food .
asian	love the hospitality of the owner and his staff . they made sure everything was perfect and that we were satisfied . a must try would be the shrimp and walnuts ( even if you don 't like walnuts ) . it was delicious ! ! !
asian	visiting from toronto and that 's the best middle.eastren food i had so far
asian	definitely will eat there again when i visit vegas next time
asian	was a bit hesitant due to the curb appeal , but it was completely worth it . we had the chicken lo mein as well as the mu shu pork , and the portions were huge . the service was excellent and fast . it is definitely worth the trip !
asian	food was great , friendly service . so glad it 's close by home . they just opened and it can get busy , so u may wait a bit longer , but believe me it 's worth the wait . stop reading and just go there now !
asian	was really impressed by the decor and service . nice quiet cozy place . they have a simple menu so there isnt alot of choices but that just makes life more easier ! we had the crispy beef panang curry ( which tasted like not nothing we have tried before-crispy outside and the softest beef ever ) and the chicken royal pad thai which was a bit sweet and really good as well . we asked for extra peanut sauce on the side . the meal went great with thai iced tea which tasted authentic . all in all-it was a great experience .
asian	was so happy they opened and i no longer have to drive to columbus for some panda . i agree the noodles are dry-- but that 's what makes them so good here ! the manager ( camilo i believe ? ) was so friendly and helpful when we had a small issue last week . he 's amazing and will keep this place amazing ! only complaint is the drive thru . it is tough that you are forced to wait even if you want to leave . poor design , but not the foods fault .
asian	food was so tasty and the honey toast dessert was too die for ! honestly you must try it , it is so good
asian	food was the best thai i 've had in town . dare i say it 's better than lotus .
asian	food was very flavorful ! ! ! ! the staff and owner are so friendly . very warm comfortable environment . definitely recommend this place ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the pho is sooo good ! ! !
asian	we came for an early dinner , and were so delighted by everything we ordered . spinach salad , without chicken , is crazy delicious . mussels were gigantic and the coconut broth w / basil was blissfully light and full of flavor . the squid salad outshines all thai restaurants in the area . the soft-shell crab , with apple salad ... dreamy !
asian	we come here quite often . the food is incredible ! he only reason have it four stars is because the front of the house staff are not as attentive to their tables as they should be . we have had to flag down a waitress before to get drinks and to take our order . not all the front staff are inattentive they do have some great servers up front such as christian . he is awesome and very good . we ask him to surprise us with food and he comes through every time . my fiancé and i will continue to come to this restaurant . you must try the coconut shrimp ! !
asian	the staff is super friendly and willing to accommodate any special request .
asian	the large is large ! ! ! really good food for the price , we had the brocolli beef and kung pao chicken with the bbq prk fried rice . definitely the place to go . eggrolls were just okay , but everything else awesome !
asian	sticky rice mango , yummy. will be back many times .
asian	we got the beef combo and it was sooooo delicious ! jennifer was our waitress . super friendly , awesome and answered all our questions ! will definitely go back !
asian	we got the tofu , curry rice , spicy miso and garlic ramen . all delicious ; better than any places in texas or cali i 've been to . def worth the plane ticket and hotel .
asian	we got the woo combo and it came with so much meat and sides were included as well like kimchi , rice , and cheesy corn ( other sides were there too ) . the bulgogi was my favorite especially dipped in the house sauce mmmmm delicious . i also appreciated the service . the server actually cooked our meat for us which i thought was so nice . would definitely come again : )
asian	we had food catered for 20 people . i was very unsure of the restaurant but the quality and quantity of food was amazing . i ordered vegetarian currys , tandoori chicken , chicken tikka masala , fish pakora & everything tasted so good . people even took a lot of food home because they gave such a good quantity . i would def. recommend this place for catering . they made my party a hit ; )
asian	we had our staff meeting catered this evening by ta lew . it was excellent . fresh cuisine with amazing flavors .
asian	we had take out and the food was ready very quickly . it was all full of flavor and so fresh . the chicken tikka masala was perfect . plenty of meat and the sauce was so tasty . definitely going back for more !
asian	we had the chicken misala , butter chicken , and beef curry . we will definitely be back for more .
asian	we had the orange chicken , crab rangoons , shrimp wonton , and chicken satay . all of it was wonderful . more so the orange chicken and the chicken satay than the other things . but overall you will not be disappointed .
asian	we had the pad thai , crab rangoons and the beef salad . everything tasted great . the location looks a bit sketchy at first from the outside , but when you 're inside it 's very warm and cozy . the food was definitely a 10 / 10 .
asian	we had the salmon carpaccio , rock shrimp , waygu surf and turf roll to start . it was all very fresh and tasty . we were still a little hungry after that so we ordered yellowtail , halibut , and uni nigiri and it was all melt in your mouth delicious . service was also really good , as soon as my water was a little low they came and filled it immediately . great place , definitely coming back !
asian	everything we ordered was well made . will come back for more ! biryani was really tasty !
asian	went with a friend and it was all excellent ! the noodles are the best in my opinion : ) - staff was great as well ! but try and get there early or be prepared to wait , as they are always busy !
asian	went with my parents and boyfriend and we all loved every mouthful . would highly recommend r & d
asian	it was delicious and spicy and we loved every bite . excellent value for money - we will be back ! ps : the two servers , angela and mj should get awards for customer service ! so kind and friendly and polite . thanks so much ! ! !
asian	sauces are authentic and tasty ! the owner is very friendly and served our family with a smile on his face . defiantly going to be a regular at yanni 's ! ! !
asian	we ordered the meat lovers for two . it was well worth it for the price . i 'll definitely come back here with more people next time .
asian	we took our 3 little kids and the service was very attentive to us . we order the bbq a pork , chicken fried rice , lok lak beef , and the lemongrass chicken . everything was to die for . we will make this a regular spot .
asian	we tried tons of things tonight and it was all great . some of the best food i have ever had . not only was the food great but the service was incredible . felt like a queen .
asian	we went to celebrate a family members graduation and of course we started off with drinks . amazing cocktails then we had sashimi that melted in your mouth and red meat that sliced like butter . we finished with dessert and then went into a food coma . we woke up the next day wanting more .
asian	we went to the restaurant at 5 : 30 on a sunday and by looking at the front we thought it was maybe closed . as soon as we opened the door , you could feel the energy and hear the sounds of patrons dining . as we walked down the steps into the restaurant , we were filled with excitement ! not only was the food amazing , but it was served fast ! highly recommend it !
asian	we will absolutely be back . we found our new favorite spot ! the service was excellent ! we were so pleased to have found this gem in the city . highly recommend this place .
asian	we literarily tried everything on the menu and i liked everything . my favourite is their veg noodles ( forgot what it 's called ) but i think it 's the second one on the list . must try !
asian	price is on par with other thai restaurants . ingredients look and taste really fresh , great presentation .
asian	their yellow curry is amazing and so is their red curry ! one of my absolute favorite places to grab lunch , and their lunch prices are way affordable ... much less than a gross and greasy fast food combo meal !
asian	i 've been coming here for years and the food is always fresh and delicious . i always get the shrimp wonton with udon noodle soup and the thai style chinese brocoli. love this place .
asian	vegas doesn 't have enough small chow spots like this . we love this place !
asian	went here with my grandma . can 't wait to take all my friends here .
asian	a little pricier than the other restaurants in the area , but definitely worth it !
asian	their tonkotsu ramen is to die for ! ! ! !
asian	must haves ... the mandu salad , bulgogi burger and fried chicken !
asian	always quick delivery . the titan is amazing . if you are looking for good food you need to try this
asian	by having only donburi on the menu it is specialized on this great japanese food . the place is clean , organized and you eat looking at the kitchen working on full throttle . they have a menu for lunch and another on for dinner . i 'll suggest the chicken katsu and the buta fire . both great options . also check the karaage chicken . i 'll definitely be back again .
asian	we felt like we were eating dinner at the lee household as mr & mrs lee served up complimentary soup to start off the meal . dumplings were fantastic and you could tell they were handmade from pastry to filling . will definitely come back to this place again .
asian	just make sure to ask for rice if you want some as it doesn 't come with most . typical asian legend . many are in the gta. authentic chinese food with a slightly higher level of taste than most other places .
asian	we ( 2 diners ) had the ahi poke , korean street tacos , chow fun noodles & korean spicy seafood noodles . serving sizes were appropriate and prices great ! the food tasted as good as it looked . service , while friendly was a tad slow and disjointed . hostesses seemed to care alot more about those with reservations than walk-ins . however , we cannot wait to return to try more of the menu !
asian	wonderful , attentive staff . i tried the pad thai and drunken noodles , both were spectacular .
asian	wonderful flavors . we had pork , beef , shrimp and chicken . all great quality . for those with kids , there are no coloring sheets or plastic cups with lids . we had a great time making shadow puppets on the table , but we will come prepared next time .
asian	wonderful modern feel inside ! fantastic people ! we will be back ! if it is your first time just let them know and they will help you : )
asian	worth the line . you 'd never imagine this place is as good as it is . the chef jj is a master of multitasking and he has a great quirky personality . all the food is cooked to order in front of your face at the bar . ask for the lava sauce if your feeling bold . : )
asian	would 10 / 10 recommend . had to wait for about 25 minutes for a table . i suggest you make a reservation or show up between lunch and dinner . the soup dumplings are to die for !
asian	would definitely recommend for anyone interested in trying korean bbq ! ! new favorite place ! !
asian	wow ! straight authenticity . after four tours to korea it 's like this little restaurant fell out of korea itself . this is the real deal ! i can 't tell you much i like adashee and ajeema ! ! ! they bring you extra appetizers and half an entrée just so you can try it whatever you want mentality . they make you happy and excellent service . offer ginger honey tea for dessert ! it 's awesome ! i 'll be back for sure ! ! ! neighborhood favorite !
asian	you can see why it 's a " national " dish in japan ! ! friendly staff ! military discounts ! !
asian	you definitely got to try magic carpet and spin the wheel . very friendly staff !
asian	you must go , authentic and delicious : ) my favorite is the orange chicken and shrimp fried rice ! ! this food is great for a netflix night and chinese food !
asian	you must try the tempura shrimp ! also the buta belly melts in your mouth . definitely a great replacement for tamari . what makes it better is the menu and the price point ! i definitely will be a repeat customer .
asian	you would never know how great this place is based on it 's outward appearance and location but the inside is upscale , elegant and the some of the best thai food in the city !
asian	& love the fact that the teriyaki sauce is endless .
asian	foood was so good , my husband and i did not know where to go for our typical date night so we decided for a new place . great place tobcheck out . atmosphere is mellow , food delicious , pho was to die for especially on a chilly night . check it out
asian	the basil chicken is amazing , great fresh rolls . we went for dinner for the first time tonight , it was great . we have gone for lunch a lot , great selections , nice soups and an entre and spring roll for under 10 bucks . i don 't understand why some reviews are so bad , especially for lunch where the prices are 8 to 10 dollars . soup , main and spring roll for under 10 bucks . amazing value for the area .
asian	meh for some others . know your dishes before you order . gong bao chicken is amazing . best gong bao chicken i 've had anywhere . the fish in spicy oil is good too . some of their other dishes , not so much . came here with some non-asian friends , the stuff they ordered was gah . so essentially , good restaurant if you know what to order .
asian	all the specials are amazing . i love the takoyaki and okonomiyaki . robatayaki are pretty small , and somewhat disappointing compared to the rest of the menu .
asian	for starters i had no clue what to order and the gentlemen there were very informative about the available selections . i chose the sweet salmon bowl which was full of flavor to the very last drop ! the entire meal was fresh in taste . definitely will be returning and i recommend anyone who cares about eating quality , healthy , great tasting food to stop in and treat yourself ! an added factor is that the place is very clean and well organized ! thanks for making my night ! good food does that for me ! : )
asian	huge portions , super low prices , great specials , and so far everything i 've ordered has been very good ! i love this place ...... only reason it 's not 5 stars is the appearance . it definitely not a place you take a date to to impress . small , ugly and in the ghetto ...... to he honest , the first time i pulled up to pick up my food i was scared . it reminds me of a small n.y. hole in the wall . but if you just want a lot of really good chinese food for super cheap ....... it 's your place !
asian	found this hidden treasure after searching for new places to try and i 'm so glad we did ! ! fresh and delicious every time ! i drive 40 minutes so i can dine here ! best sushi in town ! !
asian	my favorites were the spicy tuna rolls and the mackerel . we came to this restaurant and celebrated my daughter 's birthday . had a large party of people and as a result had a large selection of food . everything was great ! not one complaint . service was top notch . i will definitely be back .
asian	good to grab and go , eat there , or for delivery . great prices also ! i found my new sushi spot ! i love it
asian	great on a date away from the las vegas strip . and recommended by a local no less !
asian	amazing fresh , authentic food ... wish i 'd thought to ask for more guidance before ordering ... it would be great to go with a big group in order to be able to sample more ...
asian	best bbq boneless spare ribs ever ! we highly recommend the lo mein and veggie fried rice & orange chicken ! brown rice is an option without an extra cost .
asian	fresh , delicious poke . the house sauce is great , and i love how you can customize your bowl . i go out of my way just to eat here .
asian	the staff are so friendly and knowledged about their menu .
asian	i am a sushi hunter everywhere we go and just ducked in here for an emergency salmon sashimi fix ... holy smokes ! ! ! ! my new go to for a healthy sashimi meal . great flavors . constantly fresh and delicious food that doesn 't break the bank . and you bounce outta there feeling fantastic ! wish i could give it 500 stars !
asian	amazing fresh , fast , and delicious dim sum for lunch - i recommend the soup dumplings !
asian	amazing fresh fish always ... owners are nice and the soy sauce they have on the side if u like is ahhhmazing : ) love it thinking about it makes me drooooollll
asian	the screaming orgasm and cherry blossom are dishes you should not miss . make a reservation as it is a small venue .
asian	fresh food amazing flavor . a must for anyone who appreciates sushi . wide variety of sushi options and some new fun items to try .
asian	the dim sum was incredible and the noodle soup was to die for . great great great jose ! ! !
asian	fresh high grade fish . one of the best sushi places in town . highly recommend this place . higher grade sushi than most other joints in town .
asian	fresh , interesting and new ! very good sushi experience . must try : charlie 's special , jun specials , rabbit pearl . enjoy !
asian	service is very quick and efficient . thank you .
asian	all the staff and sushi chefs are friendly and will make you something special at request . they have a variety of home made spicy sauces , which can have quite a kick ! prices are very modest for the quality and serving sizes . overall it 's one of the best i 've had in quite a while , and i eat sushi all over the world .
asian	always pho noodle soup soup-not so good , feels like a lot of msg noodle-portion is small beef-small portion as well note-they don 't have the tradition set up correctly ...... they cook the sprouts already .....
asian	so enters the awkward dinner form hell where everyone you 're with is eating and you 're just sitting there with a glass of water , and then leave annoyed and hungry . i understand that a customer 's diet restrictions can be a bit difficult at times , but for no basic veggie option , really ?
asian	i ordered the orange chicken lunch special that came with fried rice and chow mein . the orange chicken was just ok , nothing great . the fried rice was very bland and even with soy sauce lacked flavor . the chow mein had a lot of garlic flavor ( which is a good thing ) but just really dry . obviously i didn 't really care for this place . i will give it 2 starts for fast service and being reasonably priced . the food however is a different story .
asian	waste time ! if you decide to eat here , you would better call them first to make sure it is open or not ! tricky restaurant ! absolutely no responsibility to the customers .
asian	the overcooked beef and tofu both came out doused in americanized-takeout cornstarchy gravy . both had little or not flavor and very strange textures--the beef was barely edible as it had a kind of old freezer burn taste and crumbled in your mouth as if there were too much tenderizer used on it , but frankly it was just overcooked and tasteless . couldn 't finish it . my own beef brisket noodles had strangely cut noodles that were either too long or too short , and the beef cuts were particularly gelatinous and lacking in actual meat . they also forgot the iced milk tea . only get the stir fried noodles here guys don 't get anything else !
asian	recent experience today was an indifferent response to waiting 50 min for takeout ( they told me 20m ) . scolded for asking on order status . tried to wait patiently as everyone else ( 10 + ) folks got their food first . spoke to owner , but he did not care . disappointed to say will not go there again . not worth the disrespect and treatment .
asian	ever get that feeling when you walk into an empty restaurant and you know you should just turn around and leave ? this is that kind of place . from the decor , sparsely populated fish tanks , plastic foam holding up the fake tree , messy desk area and on top of all that they seat us ( almost empty by the way ) right where the server goes for water , utensils and all that . what we ordered : read the rest of the review here and others : http : / / chefboyd.com / 2012 / 11 / 25 / thai-original-bbq /
asian	the food was okay but hardly anything special . just average . i tried spider roll , spicy tuna roll , green salad , and miso soup . tuna roll had too much mayo , spider roll was bland , and the salad was way too salty ! the atmosphere and deco was cute and the service was amazing . i 'd skip this restaurant though if your after some really yummy sushi rolls . mi-ne sushi is 2000000 times better
asian	the service ranged from weird to average . i say weird because i find it odd when the owner walks around nonchalantly eating an entire cucumber and just sitting wherever she pleases . i suppose that 's fine with me . the food is your standard quality from a buffet and there 's definitely better chinese food out there .
asian	( b ) mediocre food : tomatoes were hard & tasteless like you 'd find at giant eagle ; salad was ridiculous--mainly cheap iceberg lettuce with a few tomato slices ; main course was nothing special ( c ) cash-only accepted : who 's heard of a restaurant that doesn 't take credit cards ! ! ! i mean , even the tiny village restaurant near nanjing , china takes my american express card ? ! oh yeah , they do post a tiny , hand-written sign near the entrance that states " cash & personal checks accepted . " c 'mon , they take personal checks but not credit cards ? !
asian	the place was closed a full half hour before the posted time - i knocked on the door and waved at the workers and all three shrugged and refused to open the door to provide service . extremely disappointing and frustrating experience . won 't be coming back , and won 't be encouraging anyone else to either .
asian	that is so disgusting . the place does not seem hygienic at all . they also have signs posted everywhere that you must wash your hands before you go to the buffet and that makes it even more disgusting . are people putting their hands inside the buffet ? the food was completely and utterly tasteless . there 's also no extra cutlery so you have to re use your gross curry spoon with the dessert . the dessert was not that great or sumptuous . i know it 's cheap food but i need some flavor when i eat and also the whole puppers coming out of a cardboard box just grossed me out big time .
asian	for 15 % tip , there was no service , food was just dumped onto our table , no greeting , took asking two different people for drinks , ladies here were incredibly rude .
asian	this food was horrible to put it politely . very limited food options , food was cold and when i gave feedback to the staff they were rude and ignored the suggesitons . stay away from this one .
asian	the vietnamese spring rolls were flavorless and bland . the waiter did not write our orders down and managed to screw them both up . the biggest disappointment was my south thai lamb curry , i was expecting tasty pieces of lamb in a masaman curry sauce , instead i received a lamb shank perched on top of a thick sauce which as i tried to cut the lamb off managed to splash the sauce all over the table . the menu did not mention it was a lamb shank ! ! vietnamese iced coffee that we ordered at the start of the meal , took nearly twenty minutes too arrive . overall a shambles of a meal .
asian	no more . expensive , poorly seasoned , odd off-flavours , minimal meat in the curries , soggy / tough naan ... never again .
asian	love how the staffs able to let your sample the food before ordering . this is definitely a really nice touch . what i got for a $ 7.59 meal at amaya express though is decent in quality but lack in quantity ! seriously half a bowl of biryani rice with 1 scoop of butter chicken is not enough for a meal , unless when i am on a diet . i think i got spoiled by all the authentic indian / sri lankan takeout places around the area ( babu is just up the street at 16th avenue ) where i can get double the food at the same price and taste more authentic . frequent buyer 's card though is a really nice touch ! !
asian	then had bland mango chicken . something that resembled tso chicken and chicken pad thai bland bland bland
asian	probably the best in the valley . but it doesn 't matter how good the food is because the service was horrible ! i haven 't gone back because the service was so , so bad . the waitress was rude , completely screwed up our order , and gave us no apologies . i probably won 't go back anytime soon .
asian	what 's the point of being open until 3 if you won 't serve what you 're known for which is ayce ? ? this is the 3rd time i 've been in after work and the time they say they stop serving ayce literally changes to whatever time is currently is . the servers just seem like they just want to leave which i understand because i 'm a server , but don 't work here if you don 't like the hours .
asian	used to be my go to place for kbbq uptown but the last 2 visits were a huge disappointment in service . quality of food is there on both visits but requests for water , rice , soup required multiple requests and the place wasn 't even busy . when they were on top of the service game i had no issue with them incorporating tip into the bill but now with the lousy service i wish i could have reduced the tip . for now i guess i 'll just stop going .
asian	we loved the basil wraps , chicken pad thai and curry dish . the waiter didn 't take our drink order , we had to track down another waiter after a long wait . then we had to ask if we could place a food order , getting the impression our waiter wasn 't interested in serving us . please note , the place was half empty . hmmmmm ......
asian	such great dishes but the worst service ever . a friend and i had ordered soup , spring rolls and one main dish to share . it took 30 minutes for the spring rolls , and then my main dish was served before my soup . which took almost an hour . they refused to split the bill for us as well . all the staff are incredibly rude . would recommend for the food but not for fast or good service .
asian	the staff is friendly but they have no clue about service . instead of getting the customers seated from the cold , they opted to take care of the bills first . once seated , it took a long time to get water and tea . again food was great , but they really need more than just two waitresses . there are 4 uncleaned tables around me . getting refills for drinks takes a long time . they also forgot one of our drink orders , it never came .
asian	i ordered via doordash . the tum yum noodle soup and the spicy basil . i ordered very spicy for both . the food was mediocre , the vegetables were still raw , the food wasn 't spicy and everything was far too sweet . i will never order food from this restaurant again . it was the worst thai food i have ever had .
asian	unfortunately at china grill , vegetarian equals bland . the only item i truly enjoyed was the baby lettuce salad , dressing was good , anything with heart of palm and artichoke is usually a fav .
asian	although the food tasted good the restaurant lacked adequate service . we waited long time to be served and when we finally did the soup and entrées came out together . we did not have plates or adequate silverware to share our food . and finally when it came time to pay the check there was no one around to take our bill . i had to shove cash in an envelope and give it to the front desk on our way out . i don 't think will come here again .
asian	the food was not tasty - i think it was the chicken in the pho that tasted bad . the rest was just bland . never been back .
asian	ambiance a + menu is really cool and innovative this place is just way too overpriced and overrated. the sushi is better at most other places in charlotte. the drinks are , however , really good even though they 're overpriced. the service isn 't usually bad but the food takes forever to come out after you wait forever for a table during busy hours since you cannot set reservations. i stopped going after the 2nd health scare incident ( that i know of ) because the price and flavor isn 't nearly enough to risk
asian	granted it was a packed friday night , but we saw our server maybe once every half hour . i was born and bred eating ramen and social house 's tasted like nothing . had to add soy sauce to get a little bit of flavor .
asian	great expectations ! when someone tells me this is one of the best thai places in the country i 'm anticipating mind blowing tastiness w / explosive flavors and heat sadly ... i received none of the above garlic shrimp was the most disappointing after all that hype ~ * ~ this place is hella expensive for the small portions and greasy food plus there is a ridiculous 60-90 mins wait because of their rep = (
asian	however the food wasn 't great . i had shrimp basil with undercooked cold shrimp . the noodles were very dry . the sticky rice was almost like me cutting through a brick lol . maybe it was just a bad night for me
asian	food and price not that great . aquired taste .
asian	unfortunately the food isn 't worth it unless you 're starving . very plain . and this is the first time i 've ever been charged for tea done careful when they " offer " tea or water .
asian	they are cheap but it shows in the quality of the food . most things are served either fried or with some kind of sweet sticky sauce . if your looking for an unhealthy and american style chinese food experience , this place is probably ok for that .
asian	its too small . just imagine 1 bedroom apartment made into the restaurant . the ambiance ruins this once an average tasting ramen . its the cup o noodle 3 / 1 $ .
asian	i would have given it three stars , but when you take the price ( very high ) into consideration , it just isnt worth it . nothing bad , just not worth $ 60 for lunch . very , very average taste and we ordered the signature rolls . there are dozens of sushi places in phoenix where you can get sushi at least as good as pure for half the cost . one more thing - the maguro was pretty low quality - pale pink in color as opposed to the bright red that you would expect at a restaurant of this caliber ( or at least this price ) .
asian	no sushi though . ordered fried rice , grilled eggplant , and two skewers . fried rice came out 30 minutes after ordering and we waited another 10 for the remainder of our food , until we finally asked the waitress . she reported that it was still coming and the guy working the grill had a lot of orders . waited another 20 minutes and no more food . it was getting late and we had to leave . they comp 'd our rice dish and apologized . we left and had to look for dinner elsewhere .
asian	service was nice . drinks were good . i had a green tea martini , pricey at $ 15 but normal for vegas . food was ... " ok . " way too pricey for what you are getting . we left hungry . i wouldn 't go back to eat a meal but would go back for drinks / appetizers if nothing else was open .
asian	eel was fishy tasting , not very fresh same with big eye tuna . a few other sushi places in area offer fresher fish but with less ambiance .
asian	went there for the ayce hot pot . if you are a beef lover , do not go there as base on how i was served on the beef , it looks like the beef has been pre-sliced , then left frozen in the freezer as such all areas of beef are exposed to frost . once cooked in the hot pot , the beef are not tender but rough . whereas the rest of the food are alright .
asian	ambience n service s nyc ... but food is not .. definately taste s nt even close to indo chinese
asian	prices : obscene . best experienced when on the corporate tab . otherwise the overhead-inflated prices will fillet your wallet . a tip to all professed " sushi lovers " - if there 's no resident master sushi chef , there 's no justification for premium prices . however , if eating with your eyes is the depth of your culinary and social requirements , you will find blowfish particularly presenting .
asian	the noodles tasted good . i didn 't like the manchurian . food was very spicy .
asian	also the fact that they don 't allow free refills is interesting . the business probably pays pennies on the dollar for all their supplies , they own the space they 're on , where is the high prices coming from ? when prices go down i 'll be more than happy to be a regular here .
asian	didn 't notice until i was leaving sanitation score was 90 , not saying that is why the food poisoning occurred but generally i dont eat at places below a 93 .
asian	the poki we were served looked like it was made a few days ago and was salvaged from the trash pile , displaying a grayish color along with a rancid smell--i didn 't even bother risking tasting it . the final turn off was just how bad the sashimi was . i love salmon sashimi and any place who can make me not eat it has to be doing it really bad . it 's unfortunate that we can no longer bring friends and families to this place which once served up good sushi . nowadays it doesn 't even look like they 're trying .
asian	don 't really have appetite for most of the entries . ordered dumplings and sushi . dumplings are alright but sushi is really bad . the rice in the sushi is hard dry , not well cooked at all .
asian	unfortunately scottsdale doesn 't have any over the top chinese . too bad .
asian	not nearly as good as any asian place in the asian district of cleveland . crazy expensive for asian food ( $ 70 for two people ) ! old crowd ( mostly cougars ) . below average food . i do not recommend .
asian	enough said . note : i may be spoiled by many trips to toronto and windsor for dim sum .
asian	on the expensive end - won 't be back .
asian	watered down pho and thai tea . good enough for a hangover though . i guess they were missing the msg or something . but if your drink and can 't get off the strip , this is your spot . and yes , chicken pho was 13 dollars and 4 spring rolls were 10 . thai tea was 5 bucks . minus well went to buffet .
asian	my buddy likes coming here , but he likes anything that strikes him as a good deal . that 's code for the prices aren 't that bad .
asian	salty , typical orange colored sauces and flavors . nearly all the main dishes are listed as market price . you 'll never make a bigger mess eating in your life . nothing special .
asian	i waited for a table , and instead a group of 20 + locals who can in after me were seated first . did give me time to look at the buffet , and clearly they did me a favor ; as the food looked terrible .
asian	the wait is horrible . took over an hour for a simple chicken teriyaki meal . the restaurant literally had 10 other people just waiting . will never return again .
asian	? this is the worst sushi i have ever had . yes the prices are amazing but that 's just a reflection of there shitty sushi . i even gave it the benefit of the doubt trying it twice and bringing friends and it was just as terrible as the time before . the color of the spicy tuna roll was literally grey . i don 't understand all the great reviews ... are we all taking about the same place ? ! goeymon and kabuto are hands down the best sushi in town .
asian	but all i could think of as i ate some chicken that attempted to make up for its lack of taste with absurdly unnecessary spiciness was what my couric output would be . disappointing in every regard .
asian	but i went into this restaurant craving ramen , and i left extremely disappointed . i 'll leave this short since i do not want to talk too badly about this place . high prices ( which are yes expected since its vegas and it 's so well known ) but the flavor was seriously lacking . let 's just say i always finish my ramen bowls . yes i know that makes me sound like a plump . but when i tried this bowl of ramen , i left with over half the bowl still there . smh .
asian	i don 't care if it 's a chinese buffet , vichy , la stanza , or the pizza hut lunch buffet ! the food is just okay . but the wine is 3 - 3.5 times the saq prices ! seriously ! ! ! who wants to pay $ 43 for a $ 13 bottle ? it 's flat-out insulting .
asian	their servings for large are not that big and when i ordered beef fried rice there was hardly any beef in it . their drinks are over priced , they sell sushi but honestly would you buy sushi from a chinese place . its like buying mexican tacos from an italian restaurant . never coming back here .
asian	the waitress recommended a sour coconut fish soup to my friend , which tasted weird ... their pho is below average with very small portion , and the service had hardly any presence .
asian	apparently , according to the internet , this occurs when noodles are made with alkali water and the preparing kitchen doesn 't change out the water frequently ( or , i imagine , uses too little water ) . first time in my life i 've encountered this , and i 've had a lot of ramen and saimin . wait staff was apologetic but didn 't offer to comp the meal . i won 't be back .
asian	amount of soup and meat is very low , i 'd say lowest around ; taste of soup is also not the best , if someone likes very nice soup try at keele & wilson just near beer store
asian	the service was great , as always , but did you get a new chef and kitchen staff ? this was not the pad thai we know and love , and even the coconut ice cream was terrible- like crystal ice milk , and blah. please don 't make us have to consider re-trying papaya thai , was a distant second to your food , but may now be pacing you .
asian	an absolute atrocity to all that is good and edible. you will see bundt cake straight from kfc. and what is up with the sushi roll with strawberries in it ? !
asian	the chicken is dry and the hot sauce that was asked for was different only in colour ( red ) from the provided bland garlic sauce . i have visited their other mississauga restaurant and found it much the same . don 't get it but that could just be me as they keep opening new locations ?
asian	i ordered custom sheepskin seat covers . she tried to pass of i 'll fitting cheap version . after several weeks of very unpleasant interaction she reordered then . they are a better fit but still feel the quality is not what i expected or what i had gotten there before . i will never do business with them again
asian	an alright izakaya. interior is cool , loved the big gong. drink menu is impressive and reasonable. however the food isn 't amazing .
asian	but what did i expect in fashion square mall . it 's cheaper to go somewhere else .
asian	somewhere along the line , this place lost the plot . needless to say , i will not be making any new memories here . rating scale : 1 star : avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe . 2 star : with so many great places to choose from , why risk this one ? 3 star : i 'll try it again or consume here in a pinch . 4 star : i go here regularly if financially and / or calorically feasible . 5 star : i look forward to taking my wife or friends here .
asian	in this case , it 's the latter . i can 't judge completely yet , as i 've only eaten there once , but after the first experience i wouldn 't go back . had dumplings and lo mein noodles . the dumplings were actually decent . but the noodles were very bland , the sauce was very salty and the pork was beyond chewy . just didn 't seem fresh to me . to make it worse , all that was about $ 25 . if i 'm spending that much for a meal , it better be delicious .
asian	hard and dry . the mongolian beef was worse . the meat was over cooked and the mushrooms not cooked , the sauce wasn 't asian . the bar tender was too busy hiting on a chick to bring me chopsticks or a fork . a new low in airport food .
asian	out of 8 dishes ordered , we loved only 1 . the rest were mediocre at best . the dynamic light fixture in the main dining room , which seems intended to entertain , is hilariously lame - we did get a laugh out of it , so there 's that . service was good ( poor staff ) .
asian	we would like to love this place , it 's new to the neighborhood . this will be our last visit , there are places in phoenix that actually employ staff that are committed to facilitating a nice dining experience . not red thai .
asian	2 stars moatly because of our server ! and old chinese that keep forgetting things we order . she forget my drink 3 times-after 20 min i finally get it . also her attitude is about the same as her english -bad ! needless to say that we will never go back- an average chineese restaurant in town have better service and maybe food too .
asian	and don 't forget your money it like most chinese restaurants " cash only . "
asian	the curry duck was good , but only because of the curry , the duck wasn 't really worth it . do not order any of the grilled stuff , it 's all just stir-fried and completely over priced for what you get . service was okay , nice but unattentive , couldn 't get her attention and never once came to ask us if we wanted anything else or if the food was okay . not terrible but definitely nothing special ; food was also a bit cold . may come back if i 'm in a pinch nearby , but probably not , otherwise .
asian	that would be in comparison to golden maki for $ 13 , or sushi den for $ 16 . for example , sushi den includes sashimi , but here you add $ 5 making for a $ 26 ayce . was the food exceptional ? no . for example , the salmon hand roll was soggy and only partially filled with salmon . the sushi was heavy on rice . the fish was fresh , but chitose was fresher . red tuna was available , but it wasn 't the rich red of fresher tuna . overall , this is not a bad restaurant , it just doesn 't compare with others . it would be a perfectly respectable ayce for $ 14--not $ 21 .
asian	i know the secret here and it 's my formula for success all through college . you take some meat , add veggies , and make an oyster sauce rue and viola , instant " authentic " chinese food . we ordered several random dishes here and it was all the same . i was pining for some panda after this ... ugh . only if this was being cooked by midgets on donkeys in an outdoor kitchen then yes , instant classic .
asian	they tried to tailor to the local crowd .. but the flavors were not authentic. a lot of just .. soy sauce and satay sauce , and ... why didn 't i just walk a block away to go to chinatown ? chinese donut dipped in mussel juice is not exciting me at all . cute decor , attentive staff , over priced , and food was very .. meh. ordered 3 dishes , not memorable. wont ' come again , this was not the type of chinese food i signed up for. walk a block east and north , lots of fabulous chinese flavors awaits .
asian	they got the order wrong even after clearly repeating it several times and there was a nice long hair in the dipping sauce . yum !
asian	nothing gourmet meal about this place : - / it 's just a regular chinese food taste less , cold , the pig knuckles is very tough not cook enough and no taste , ribs are dry . service is poor ! ! ! ambiance is nice the rest need help ! !
asian	but not coupled with the horrible service . maybe it was a sign out server forgot to out in half out order ? im going to miss the honey toast and beef bowl : ( sorry ichiza , we had a good run !
asian	and they 've officially shut down , not surprised at all this place was terribly run .
asian	with the recent name change from china garden to china ok go , sadly i have lost my favorite chinese take out . with the name change , they must have changed all of the chefs as well . i recently ordered the same options i have always selected . none of it was the same ... chicken chop suey , house fried rice , pepper beef and won ton soup . none of it was very good , period ... maybe that will change someday , but until then , i am revising my rating to a 1 from a 5 .
asian	as a noodle lover i really recommend this restaurant , their variety of noodles is great and their beef brisket is awesome .
asian	i used to always enjoy coming here , yet this time the food was utterly horrible . the food was so salty that it burned my mouth and i was not able to eat another bite . it seems like people are starting to stay away from here . i will definetly never return to here again .
asian	exemplary for when one shouldn 't open up a restaurant . the kitchen was filthy as were all the kitchen equipment.there was so many things wrong with this place that i will only put a synopsis food was horrible . management and service was terrible . no health inspection score posted and the kitchen and establishment reflects it . my new comparisons for all restaurants will be " is it worse than new china ? " i would recommend this place to all my enemies or to people looking for cheap explosive enemas .
asian	lack of ramen stock atmosphere . ramen shop should have a very rich ramen stock atmosphere . i tried the shoyu . then i know that their ramen failed in soup stock . i recommend their chef should learm how to have a good ramen stock . i like this shop because they serve beer , the new kurunama . eggs are good .
asian	ordered sushi for pick-up . they said it would be 30 minutes . just went to pick up and they said it would be 20-30 more minutes . zero apology . completely understaffed and unprofessional . when you call for pick-up they just continue their conversation with staff for several minutes while you wait on the line . interesting way to run a business .
asian	they forgot our appetisers and messed up one of the main courses , forgetting to exclude chicken from the pad thai even after they had been told that one of my friends only eats halal . they quickly rectified their mistake , but i can 't be sure if they cooked the pad thai afresh or simply removed the chicken from the original serving . my goat brisket was 99 % fat and uninspired . my friend did not like his pho at all . the best part about the restaurant : the vietnamese murals on the walls .
asian	just no . when we called they said is was taking long because it was raining . our order never even came ! no call no nothing . good thing we were willing to drive to wok wey . this place is ridiculous .
asian	delivery driver was friendly but person taking orders was less than happy about her job .
asian	and the broth of the house noodle soup was so weak it was inedible .
asian	an hour wait for delivery- rude staff- order online so you don 't have to talk to them , foods okay but the staff will leave you with a foul taste in your mouth .
asian	not sure if the food is any good or how much longer it would have taken , as we walked out after waiting forever for our meal .
asian	the prices are like any other local bar . the design inside is pretty nice with a small lounge area . however , the place is dead . there wasn 't anybody inside on a saturday night . i guess that might be a good thing for some people . however , i like to interact with a few other people . the food isn 't that great . the best thing was probably the pot stickers . i guess if you just want a quiet place to chill that feels pretty nice , this is a nice place to go .
asian	large portion but quality is not up to par .. i got the trio combo meats ( chicken , slice beef and galbi ) all lack in flavors and the beef is so damn chewy . the side mac salad is so bland ! ! ! ! never coming to any ohana restaurants anymore and i 'm afraid to try their new restaurant taste which is rt next door ( same owner ) . oh i do not like the peach tea , awful .. too sweet and weird taste . the tea milk w grass jelly was decent not great ..
asian	went here for lunch with a couple friends on a friday afternoon . we were the first to arrive and luckily we beat the lunchtime rush because 20 minutes later the place was full and you would not have been able to find a seat !
asian	prices and services are good . but they take only cash or debit .
asian	pad khing with beef had absolutely no ginger ( or flavor in general ) and had the taste and consistency of microwaved lean cuisine . the only flavor to the prik pao with chicken was the red pepper / chili oil , which , to its credit , made it slightly more palatable than the pad khing . the vegetables on both dishes were soggy and flavorless . likewise , the fresh rolls tasted like they were rolled the day before , with wilted lettuce and a rubbery wrapper . we ordered relatively simple dishes . the food we received suggests that the quality of the ingredients and the skill of the cooks are both woefully lacking .
asian	this is my second time here and it wasn 't as good as i remember . we ordered the red chicken spicy pork and jerk fried rice . yes quite the combo . i did like the black beans . they were flavorful and not too smooth . the rice tasted so so . it did have an ok flavor but rice was a bit old and stale . pork was tough and overfried . the chicken had a good flavor . just the right amount spice . while it is easy to order it is and a dicey stile atmosphere which is fun and the place was super packed . it was a . it overrated . worth truly worth trying once .
asian	sadly it has gone from very good to mediocre at best .
asian	5 / 24 unable to get in some sort of party . asked for to go food they said no .... today i see on the door they have delivery ? ? ? 5 / 25 i come in there were only 3 customers ... imagine my shock when the waiter wanted me to sit at a tiny table behind the entrance wall ... i went off on him . dude this place has l 30 emply tables and paper table cloths whats the problem ? finally got a table .... i rate the food a 3 / 10 wont be back its just a headache to find parking and deal with bs on a 1 hr lunch break
asian	was charged gratuity at 15 % when there was only two of us . also pricier then other places with food just avg. atmosphere is nice though . went for a la carte. got seafood noodle , sweet and sour chicken , lemon deep fried pork , kam ja tang. kam ja tang was not spicy at all , mild flavours. was ok , but would not order again. only thing good was the seafood noodle , which really was avg and would not come back here . didn 't try ayce korean bbq . looks gd though and crowd were korean so can 't be that bad
asian	i was completely disappointed because not one thing came as ordered and they did not even include soy sauce packets in my delivery . i do understand there are worse things but it would be nice after travelling all day to get a great meal and thought this had pretty good yelp reviews . my order with notes - 1 vegetable egg roll ( greasy and stale tasting ) , 1 bean curd vegetable soup - please use vegetarian broth ! ( came with chicken broth and lots of green peppers ) , 1 vegetable chow mein fun - no onions and no green peppers please ! ( yup , you guessed it onions ) - see photos . no dinner for me tonight .
asian	the ingredients weren 't not fresh but they weren 't of decent quality . having said that , it is not a bad restaurant . just not good . the server i had was very lovely though , and my experience dining there was that much better because of her .
asian	plus , the " chef " used the same towel the entire time we were there- but rinsed it out in the sink as we were leaving - humm , question the health department a ?
asian	for years i 've been coming here every time i come into town . no more . we had a table of 9 and the waiter was so rude and condescending when we asked him to repeat our order ( he did get one wrong , btw ) . when our food came is was ok , not spectacular like before . the waiter slapping our dishes down where ever he wanted on the table didn 't make it any better . i won 't be going back .
asian	the food tastes not so good . i ordered the cake and that was even bad .
asian	suddenly , he left my table and help other table without saying excuse or saying sorry when returned . he tried to persuade us to order his favorite food he thinks it 's good . we ordered something else ; he showed his ugly attitude .
asian	drove 20 miles one-way ( actually thought it was closer than that ) for take out . get there over 20 minutes before they were supposed to close according to their website and the hours shown on their door ( pictured ) . but ohhhhhhhh no ! - closed . i 've been to genghis grill in tucson and the food is awesome ! so , this review / location gets 2 " legacy " stars based on my previous experiences .
asian	have you ever been to a restaurant before ? was this the first time you ever eaten food ? this place is bad from top to bottom . the food is not good , and the dining room area smells terrible . there are no signs that can be seen from the north , so anyone coming from 90 would miss it completely .
asian	ordered the twice cooked pork and jalapeño beef . nothing close to traditional chinese cooking . can 't even come close to the chinese food in cali
asian	it took us a long long time to eat dinner here on a thursday night when it wasn 't busy at all . looks like our server was socializing with another and not keeping track of his tables . on the upside ... i always thought ordering asian food in an non-asian setting would be weird , but their dragon fire chicken was pretty good - i like the combination of citrus , spice , and cilantro .... makes for some flavor explosions on your tongue .
asian	it tasted like sugar milk tea with sugar bobas . the texture of the boba was fine . but they need to cut back on the sugar ! so sweet , it overpowers everything . i even waited for the ice to melt so that it could hopefully dilute the drink a bit . it didn 't help , cuz it was still sweet ... on to the next boba place ! : d
asian	i order a 18 pcs of sashimi and the fish was a size of my baby finger . the salmon was a little fair . i order a large sake and told the server make sure it 's really hot . it came out warm .
asian	located inside the seafood supermarket i had no idea it was a filipino fast food franchise .. it simply read chicken & burgers ... i don 't really have much to say on this one .... i barely got past the smell of the burger to take the one bite i tried before spitting it out . definitely an acquired taste because the place was packed and everyone else seemed to be enjoying the chicken meals not too many eating burgers : (
asian	try hiro or ematei , much better quality and service. check out the actual food / drink to make sure it is what you ordered. we ordered large sake and was given a small one , waiter did not want to correct the error initially. took me some hard work to get it resolved. then we ordered premium sushi dinner and was provided regular sushi dinner , a chinese lady " manager " came and told us it is almost the same and refuse to change . i would expect better food and service at this restaurant .
asian	good prices and ok food . indian food from a truck is not particularly appealing to me , i 'd prefer to walk a little further and have indian food on craig street . if i 'm in a real hurry i prefer other trucks .
asian	we ordered 3 dishes and 1 beef noodle soup . the noodle resembles instant noodle , and my husband who usually loves the noodle soup ate less than half . thai basil ground chicken is the most flavorful dish , but surely salty . the japanese egg tofu tastes ok . the worse dish is the eggplant pot and seafood / fish in the dish is not fresh and tastes gross . the service was so slow . all the dishes were brought in different time , and we had to wait long time between dishes .
asian	another disappointing chinese restaurant their saving grace was their crap house that were actually pretty good other than that food had no flavor no spice even when you ask for chili pay stores oil it was super bland no spice at all very oily service was very mediocre forgot to bring drinks forgot to bring silverware brought one of the dishes and then took 10 minutes for the other one by then my food is getting cold i suggest going somewhere else unfortunately
asian	cheap yes , taste yes , tastes like ramen should , absolutely not . the broth is certainly not a tonkotsu broth and tasted like repurposed chicken stock . the noodles were also not fresh and had a package taste to them . if you 're going to use the word ramen in your name learn how to make ramen . and who puts giant onions in ramen ? ? the restaurant was clean and the service was decent if you 're looking for decent ramen this is definitely not the place
asian	i went there two weeks ago around 8pm during the week . it was empty , which is not very pleasant . ( on the other hand , it seems fuller on friday and saturday ) . we had a curry and a pasta dish . the food was not very tasty , and , while it is not very expensive , it was not worth the price we paid for . unimaginative thai food ( which is too often the case in the us ) . i probably won 't be back .
asian	i ordered the miso pork bone soup . very disappointed with the soup because i could only taste the saltiness of from the miso . putting bean sprouts into the ramen is just gross. come on ! this is not viet pho . $ 10.95 for a ramen like this is definitely a no no . never gonna go back .
asian	my kid like this place so i let him give it a go . to me everything looks dried out & very pastey sauces . they no longer have crispy beef and the other stuff just looks weird so my son chose orange chicken w / half noodles half rice . whats up with the fried rice w / no pork ? yuk ! i 'm not a fan i 'd rather go to pick up stix at least its made to order .
asian	the pork sisig is underwhelming & over crispy and too greasy ! the bangus sisig is better if not lacking flavor . the bami pancit is a little bland and no distinct flavor either ! the kare- kare lacks peanut taste and noticeable curds of cornstarch !
asian	the food at this place makes panda garden look like a * real * chinese restaurant . the " potstickers " are really " deep fryer " stickers and are so glutenous you could use them to plug holes in your boat . there is nothing even remotely authentic or even edible in this armpit . avoid asian house like the plague . thoroughly vile . if you would like a real , authentic chinese meal , head over to ichiban on park street . that place will knock your socks off . if you ever find yourself thinking about eating here , head up the street to mcdonalds where the food is both more nutritious and has more flavor .
asian	cute decoration ( love their glass ) , dimly lit place , nice open patio to eat outside . suffering the same problem as their japanese cuisine neighbour ' injapan ' in that their food is highly forgettable . i would 've given this place a 3.5 though just because their glass noodles has some flavour and chicken cutlet is a little bigger . also purple rice . on ritual .
asian	food was low , they were stacking orders for waiting on orange chicken . the employee " aman " was flippant with the customer before me , and i had to ask her to refresh the fried rice for my order as mine had been cooling in the stack for some time . she complied , but seemed put out . the employee " omar " was helpful . no one was smiling , no one was greeting , just flat business attitudes . i get the feeling that the flat attitudes come from the management level , as there is no joy in the place . dear management , please lead ! thankfully the orange chicken was fresh ( because we waited ) .
asian	it was pretty crowded when we went , so we had to split into two parties to make seating easlier . everything i had there was just ... okay . i didn 't really expect anything that great , since we were pretty far inland and in the nevada desert . you da ma too ! ( spicy tuna w / salmon and spicy mayo ) - underwhelming salmon nigiri - not fresh alaskan salmon roll - pretty skimpy points for having unusual ( sometimes suggestive ) names for special rolls .
asian	tastes like americanized sushi . everything was too salty or too sweet . meh . decor was like a low budget neighborhood place .
asian	i 'm not sure if i should get delivery from here anymore . i ordered at 18 : 30 ( 6 : 30pm ) right after my sons soccer practice . now it 's after 20 : 00 ( 8pm ) past his bedtime and we are still waiting . can the delivery service at this location get it together ! ?
asian	named after the now defunct woodstone eatery , the restaurant opens at the location where hong kong cafe used to be . the food is decent but nothing special making the overall price value proposition to be worse than expected . couple that with bad service ( literally took them 40 minutes for me to receive my tea although my friend 's tea was served inmediately ) . when asked where my tea is , the answer was " we 're busy . " also when we paid , they short changed us by $ 5 . never again . not recommended at all .
asian	disappointed at the first bite , after waiting for 5 mins in the long line . it 's okay only if you are a meat lover and only cares about how much meat you can eat . a lot of handkerchieives with suspicious feedbacks on the wall . those in chinese to my knowledge are probably fake , no real person speakscin that way .
asian	no salad instead for some reason they gave me 2 scoops of half way decent fried rice the egg rolls were the frozen bland variety needless to say i am not at all impressed .
asian	nowhere to be seen then i get a little note from yelp saying , hey , you took some pics , how about writing a review . well , i am frustrated by the lost lengthy review so i will keep this one brief . went in for late lunch with the gf . mistaken impression that hibachi meant it was bbq 'ing meats on a lil hibachi either self serve or cooked to order . told it was basically teppan style and not available until evening . not happy . went ahead and ordered some sushi , soup and a few other unremarkable items . nothing stood out for either of us . no plans to return pics posted ages ago
asian	ordered the kam ja tang and for $ 10 it did not include the rice . well , the bones were of low quality and the broth plain . sometimes i pity people who can 't cook real good quality food at home so they go out to eat crap .
asian	i ordered red curry chicken and basil beef . i could tell that this could be better with a bit of fine tuning , but i could barely discern the flavours because the sauces were so watered down . over rice i could barely taste anything . add to the , the portions are minuscule . won 't be ordering from here again .
asian	another one that closed down . went there once . i was underwhelmed by the food and felt that it was overpriced .
asian	one of their unmemorable soups was extremely salty . i asked the waiter if he 's tried it and he said ' no . ' i think the chef spilled the salt shaker in the process of concocting a nonedible dish . the waiter just said " well , would you like to counter the taste with some sweet dessert ? " are you f * * * ing kidding me ? not worth the time or money . do yourself a favor and eat at chipotle and panda expess for a fusion experience .
asian	i have been eating the thai lemongrass soup 2-3x a week for the last year + . i love it so much . just last week they changed the recipe , and it is not good . it no longer contains real chicken - instead it contains chicken scraps . the soup is now thick and it tastes like yellow curry . it 's a big ol ' mess . i 'm really disappointed and now have no use for this place . their other offerings are not enough to keep me coming back .
asian	if you like rolls the california roll that came with it was edible but my review is on the sushi and sashimi . it seems as though people leaving reviews that this is great sushi are eating it for the first time or perhaps haven 't tried good quality authentic sushi
asian	returned my orange peel beef again . they consistently cook it to the consistency of a cremated piece of wood . i returned the dish and asked for king pau chicken instead . chicken was great , but the accompanying brown rice was ice cold . just can 't seem to get things right here . i 'll try going to the one on gilbert road instead .
asian	another yelp review failure ... i love seafood especially sushi and decided to give it a go and was very excited .... in the end .... complete failure ... if you are quality over quantity kind of a person , i wouldnt recommend this place .. and i guess i shoud not have expected any quality at a buffet in the first place ..
asian	one waitress for about 15 tables made the " express lunch " super slow . the gyoza was delicious , the fried rice not too much flavor and the tempura shrimp on the only side . i might come back someday for teppanyaki but i won 't come back to the restaurant side .
asian	not the worse , but far out competition for the top 50 japanese restaurants in toronto ( would be around 250 .. ) . closes early . not very tasty . not sure about freshness ( i.e. , not obviously that fresh ) . too much corn starch in sauce for a japanese restaurant . go elsewhere .
asian	i refused as we will never be returning to benihana . with the horrid service and the unsympathetic nature of all their employees we would never support them again . samantha implied that it was not their food or restaurant that gave me food poisoning . well , since it was the only place we ate that night i don 't think she is trying to save their ass . she also refused to honor my original gift certificate / coupon . i highly reccommend other places . at the extreme price they charge for mediocre food that everyone should go elsewhere . there are other amazing places out there .
asian	i tasted the difference right away . i withdraw my previous rating of 5 stars .
asian	rolls are horrible , they r wet and rice falling apart , tempura mix they only give u 6 slices of pumpkin and 3 small shrimps at least they r fresh , seafood udon they only give u tiny tiny squids . no more chance to go back again
asian	literally too tough to chew . curry is mediocre at very best . definitely wouldn 't recommend any of the drinks - everything tastes super watered down . apparently the service here is infamous ( downright rude ) , and i wouldn 't disagree - it really is awful . can 't think of any reasons for me to suggest that anyone come to green lemon grass , but i can come up with a whole bunch to avoid it !
asian	not my favorite place . i 've had plenty of ramen soup . everything about the soup was off . the noodles weren 't right , the chicken broth and miso were greasy ... i ate half and sort of started to get grossed out from the fatty smell . i did get the japanese fried chicken appt , good gosh , i could not bite into in the chicken . gross . nah nah .. i dont recommend !
asian	got the cheaper kung pao chicken ( 14.50 i think ) and immediately regretted it . i would pay 5 dollars for that entree . also , the noodles my friend ordered came out in less than 5 minutes . i don 't know about you but 5 minutes is not a lot of time to cook ( reheat ) anything . the only reason any1 should ever come to this place is when all the other places inside the hotel are closed . make sure to plan your day accordingly : )
asian	i went to order a traditional bahn mi ... look , i am a not a cheap ass but nine freaking dollars for a sandwich made me laugh . really ? should be $ 3.25 . just like they are everywhere else . i understand the monopoly and the game but come on .... that is a disgrace and disrespectful by all means . not even good , not worth it , not worth a second chance .... bummer .
asian	it 's like going to a club with jesus staring at you . i guess all the asians in club don 't care how a white guy took asian religion and pretty much trashed it and shoved down their throat . they 're pretty happy at throwing away money to be degraded . buddhist are pretty peaceful . if this had been muhammad , this place would be closed due to extraordinary circumstances . i couldn 't stand the atmosphere .
asian	i gave it one star bec the travel channel was on while i was being nauseated by this slop ! for the price i paid for this " food " i could have enjoyed a meal at kabutos . but i missed the lunch special and ended up in this pit ! i ordered the shrimp and filet mignon . ha ! i got two dirty shrimp and a chopped up bubba burger ! the fried rice was dry and disgusting with canned corn sprinkled in it . i can go on but i choose not to relive the experience .
asian	my mistake for thinking sushi at an airport would be a good idea .
asian	it 's been almost a year since i ate here , and i still have nightmares just thinking about it : : shudder : :
asian	anyone who does it here ... for this cheesecake , is an idiot . it 's fine , but it 's nothing to wait even 2 minutes for . fortunately i had a neighbour bring some home .
asian	the rice here is a congealed mess . mushy and doesn 't seem like it 's prepared sushi rice . the fish lacked flavor . i should have been weary when they loaded the nori and rice in a machine and it come shooting out the bottom . employee 's are nice and service is ok for counter service .
asian	normally i think crappy chinese food is good . this is below my standards .. yuck
asian	i 've had better pho in tx . it 's a hole in the wall like most pho places . typical ambiance one would expect . i ordered the rare beef pho with meatball which was not rare at all ( chewy and overdone ) and came with exactly one meatball cut in half . the bun noodles were soggy like they had been sitting broth all day . it at least came with all the typical accompaniments including basil , jalapeño , bean sprouts , and lime . service was passable . food came out quick . won 't be back .
asian	this " hibachi " nonsense is a total caucasian invention . literally the worst food i 've ever eaten , and i 'm pretty sure they gave my daughter food poisoning . it 's terrible ... i don 't know who all these people are that like it , but they 've obviously never eaten real japanese food , because the garbage they offer is about as tasty and authentically japanese as mcdonald 's . i miss hamikaze , sushi mac and mushi in los angeles . i can 't wait to get back to ca to get some actual japanese food !
asian	i went here on a weeknight when it was relatively empty , with a few men on business who probably didn 't have to pay . the decor feels authentic but quite dated , with the female servers wearing kimonos . i ordered the salmon dinner for $ 29 , which i thought would at least be a bento box at this price . wrong . it came with an average miso soup and salad , rice , and a small piece of salmon which i could have made myself . maybe if you 're on business , you can afford to try one of every dish , but i don 't think this restaurant deserves a second chance .
asian	they are terrible here . if in las vegas try dakao and you will get the best bahn mi around .
asian	the fishy smell is the first indication that the sushi probably isn 't the freshest . just okay , but since it 's in kent , sometimes you settle with what you got .
asian	i started my meal with the fried wontons that the lady said had pork in them . well if there was pork in them you would need a microscope to find it . those same in the shape of flat wontons came in my wonton soup . my wife had the lomein ( soft noodles ) tasted like spaghetti which i put some in my wonton soup to give it substance . they also need to have rules of conduct for their customers . there was a guy ( a regular i might add ) in there on his cellphone on speaker carrying on a conversation . i dought this place would survive in chinatown in la .
asian	limited selection , nothing spectacular with their food . definitely not gourmet food and not worth the price . to top it off the ended up making sick for 2 days after . they have an early bird special if you dine before 5 : 30 pm ... funny thing there was virtually no food put out on the buffet tables . how do you have an early bird special when there is no food ! ? ? avoid this place !
asian	very disappointed . great service , nice individualized bathrooms and booth seating . former china grill location . seaweed salad and miso cod were overly sauced . two pieces of toro were $ 34 and not the best quality . haven 't ordered or seen a lava cake at any new restaurant in years , so of course i had to order and it tasted like something i could make at home . not great . everything edible , just really mediocre compared to yellowtail and everything else on the strip . skip !
asian	i have not tasted the food , but microwaved food is definitely not something i want to pay this much for ! and yes i noticed a lot of good reviews before coming here .
asian	any restaurant that pads the tip deserves a low rating !
asian	we were staying at the golden nugget and decided to get a couple of rolls before hitting the strip and we were thoroughly disappointed . sushi is fish , but it should never taste fishy and both rolls we were served were not fresh and tasted awful . the service was slow and the experience was an all around fail . do yourself a favor and check out the buffet upstairs .
asian	period . food was just okay . and service was ridiculous because they have young teenagers serving you , and they have no clue about sushi . eat at your own risk .
asian	the quality of the chicken in my yellow curry was subpar . the calamari smelled and was also poor quality . the curry itself was very bland and not flavorful at all . i was very disappointed . would have done 1 star but our waitress was just the sweetest thing .
asian	had boiled shrimp at the time and went home with severe food poisoning . honestly , i really enjoyed the lobster roll prior to the shrimp poisoning . 10 / 10 recommend that .
asian	everything has fish oil , or oil that has been used to fry fish . there is a lot of cross contamination , and some of their employees are not being paid properly .
asian	aaaaand everytime i come in at lunch they 're out of half of their food items . you wouldn 't believe how many people come in , see half empty trays and just walk back out again . it 's like this location doesn 't want to make any money . i don 't think i 've ever been here and not had to wait for something to be cooked or just left so i don 't waste time .
asian	i also always ask for extra veggies and never receive them . but it 's close and convenient when i 'm too tired to cook . plus the veggies , meat and bread are always fresh . i won 't be ordering from this location again as it has become a total waste of money .
asian	the food is slightly worse than mediocre . the service is ok . there are much better places in the area and this place is ok if you can 't get into the other places .
asian	the hot and sour soup was just a bowl of saltwater , the seared tuna salad was as unimpressive as it was unoriginal . i was kind of hoping that i 'd finally have an experience there that didn 't suck ; nope .
asian	as i said , earlier much bigger players are entering the market ! it 's more than catering to a select few who enjoy only fatty soup and fatty pork . where is your response to your customers concerns ? where is your website , your blog , your facebook page ? i am still disappointed by my experience here and the poor attention to the customers waiting on the sidewalk . i have no reason to return to sansotei now , with all the other quality ramen places i can select from in the neighbourhood .
asian	the food is average at best when compared to any other gta ayce japanaese restaurants . the ayce is overpriced given the quality of food ( but to be fair , it is the path after all ) . if i 'm in the mood for sushi , any of the sushi shop locations would produce much higher quality sushi than this place ( despite being food court-style stands ) . honestly , i would not come here if it weren 't for my coworkers who occasionally like to drop by for a visit .
asian	rolls were soggy shishito peppers - super soggy edamame was ok drinks strong service - good - felt bad for the lad in all that racket serving bad food cost - ridiculous
asian	the hot and sour soup was just a horror--thickened with so much corn starch it was just terrible--and the bean curd dish i tried was just swimming in a watery teriyaki sauce . my friend had a noodle dish w / crab that was nothing but flavorless noodles and nearly no crab . when we told the server that we didn 't want to take any of the food home , he didn 't seem surprised . not a good sign .
asian	authentic vietnamese ? not really . but still good . a decent vietnamese-ish experience . kind of like a watered down martini . it 's watered down and doesn 't pack the same punch , but it 's still a martini ! would we go back ? if it 's july or august and the other more authentic options are closed , yea , probably . any other time of year ? meh . probably not . there are too many other options .
asian	i work in the area . i love chinese barbecue . and noodle soups . duck sells these items , and per other reviewers they do a pretty good job of it at reasonable prices . i 'd think they were more reasonable if they took credit cards , though .
asian	i called to complain and i 'm waiting to hear back . i rarely buy food from them since they 're not my favourite as their food is too sweet-sugary tasting .
asian	we ordered pork bone soup and asked for mild , but it came up with clear soup base . really ? ! pork bone soup with clear soup base ... we called our server and had it changed to spicy , a few mins later they got us the same soup but with a bunch of spice on the top . wow ! we gave up and just had it cancelled and got the bill . bottom line : if a korean restaurant can 't even cook a basic korean dish that almost all the korean restaurants can do a decent job at , it 's not a korean restaurant , but a restaurant wants to be called " korean " restaurant . nice try !
asian	that 's what i always say . if bathrooms are filth , the place is not worth patronizing . every time i have been here , i will my bladder into expanding itself so i can avoid the restrooms . today , i could not . the bathroom needed serious attention , and i left the mall shortly thereafter because i felt a film forming on my skin just by being in the place . the stores themselves are fine . a lot of them have student discounts ( i 'm still a student of my 3-years-ago alma mater , don 't tell nobody ) so be sure to ask if you are a student or a cheater like me .
asian	a place that don 't have good service just is not good i called at 945 and this hispanic girl answered she had a huge attitude i felt like telling her off but didn 't but love the jumping rice noodles with chicken get rid of that chick ! ! !
asian	a poem to mediocrity : not much to say , ' cept this place is very spacious seats are far enough can 't hear the table next to us forgot what i ordered not that it 's important menu 's very set can 't customize your ramen probably ordered shoyu base with pork and egg on top didn 't have a long wait but when it came it wasn 't hot soup was pretty average taste was mediocre before today i didn 't think i was a ramen connoisseur taste doesn 't really stand out i don 't think i 'd recommend if i had to give a rating i 'd give four out of ten .
asian	i go in at 11 : 45 am on a wednesday morning . there are three customers . the waitress wants to seat me at a little table facing the back wall of the narrow little room . i ask if i can instead sit at a little table that faces out on the other side of the room . the waitress reluctantly agrees . but then she gets into a long and loud argument with the chef and disappears into the kitchen to argue more intensely . at that point i decide that it is unlikely that i will enjoy a pleasant and relaxing lunch there and leave . some folks probably shouldn 't be in the restaurant business .
asian	we visited on a saturday night and the place was packed . few of our items took forever to show up.they mixed up some of our items with others and there was some confusion with the final bill . the only items worth mentioning were pongal ( rice cooked with lentils , laden with ghee , peppercons and cashews ) and mirchi bajji ( chillies stuffed with spices and batter fried ) . the vegetable cutlet is definitely stale and tasted really bad . overall , the food and service were sub-par .
asian	i 've been coming here for years and it seems that something is always broken . first of all its cash only , they do take credit and debit but you have to go next door to sushi shop , pay there and bring back the receipt which is very annoying when it 's busy . secondly , the bathrooms are almost always out of order . and when they do work , count yourself lucky if there 's both soap and toilet paper inside . lastly the wifi is spotty at best , it will crap out at any minute and not work for the rest of the day . the upside is there are lots of chairs and they keep it warm inside .
asian	this place was terrible . inexcusably dry fish , burned " grilled " vegetables and the worst ( read : slowest ) service ever . the place was packed with " all you can eaters " who appear to be more interested in quantity over quality . i trust the all you can eat menu is why portions were so small as well , not really fair for those not interest in pigging out . walked out on $ 40 worth of food on the table , it was literally that bad .
asian	don 't get me wrong , i love the whole japanese attire the waitresses wear but what they should be sporting is a smile . is that too much to ask . really ? the food 's ok but the presentation is horrible and the prices are outrageous . i work across the street and this place isn 't going to be my go to restaurant .
asian	dish wise : scallops + no texture beef chow fun + + of the dishes pretty good kung pao chicken - aside from spice , not much taste shrimp fried rice - plain bbq pork - dry
asian	no highchairs , no kids menu , nada . came a few weeks ago with the kids and wasn 't too pleasant . decided to order to go this time but apparently they won 't honor the happy hour prices on to go . thanks for mentioning that on the phone . last time i 'll eat or order from here .
asian	not much of a selection for european foods . scratch this one off the list unless you are looking for noodles , fish or pretty much anything you can find at the 99 ranch or greenland supermarket . oh yeah , there is a membership fee .
asian	apparently they have an intriguing menu . apparently my friend was super anxious to try that menu . apparently this friend took me there for lunch . apparently this friend didn 't do her research . apparently .... lunch at motherhome is pre-cooked lunch counter specials . for what we had , it was just another regular fill-d-stomach meal . 2.5'd owner was friendly almost gave us steam rice overdose , we kindly denied . spicy curry goat with rice ( $ 5.99 ) fish in tomato sauce ( $ 7.99 ) apparently " someone " needs more thorough research for her future trips . let 's learn from our experiences shall we ?
asian	then i ask for a wintermelon milk green tea and she puts milk green tea instead . then the drink maker put ice when i asked for none . the milk tea is earl grey instead of the standard black tea . their boba is good though but thats about it .
asian	for the worse . dosed with msg , prices are higher , and service is sub-standard . such a shame , this used to be our favorite place for hawaiian style chinese food .
asian	maybe i was just spoiled on her really low prices but now her prices are about average and it takes the wow factor out of it for me . i loved the fact that i could come and order a couple of entrees for 10 bucks . now that time has passed . the real turn off was finding a hair in my chips . i took them back up to the owner and she apologized and offered to bring me another basket . at that point i just paid the bill and left . i really loved komex as you can tell from my previous reviews . at this point i just feel like the success has turned to greed and i won 't be back .
asian	see customer review . wherein the owner was also arguing : fighting with the customer . this is exactly what the waiter and another restaurant worker was telling us - that the owner have a problem . i will not be surprise if one day there could be an incident here that will end up really bad , this owner is a mental case . reminds me of random shooting . only to find out , way too late that the culprit have history of mental problem .
asian	they have a very limited lunch menu . i called before i came down to make sure they were open but they didn 't mention the limited menu so when i took a $ 30 cap from the strip i was very disappointed
asian	that must be why they 're known for being " so fast , " you gotta be in walking distance for them to deliver to you at all . i had to repeat everything four times minimum and i 'm still not sure she got our address right .
asian	it is a lousy chinese restaurant . i ordered 3 dishes and all 3 were buried in a soupy brown sauce even the rice . the people who are chinese were nice but they need to remove the thai name and learn to cook ! i lived in thailand for 10 years ...
asian	i ordered from them a month ago , great service and food wasn 't bad . tonight .. whole other thing . i used the same online ordering process they had before . they took my order , charged my card and no food came . when i called , they are saying i am out of their service range . the service who handles the online ordering is handling the cancellation .. sounds like lazy employees staffing the place tonight ..
asian	the place is pretty small . we were a group of 6 . it barely fit all of us . there are only a few items in this restaurant , i was hoping that 's their best dishes . food comes fairly quick , you are suppose to put in all the side dishes come with the noodle . the side dishes were very small , and the server kept telling us to do this and do that . such that , she can collect the dishes faster . the food was average , noodle not hot enough , portion is small . if you are looking for snacks between meals , or quick meals . this place is an option .
asian	their sushi rolls are ones with lots of mayo and tempura .. ( * very americanized-type sushi / / basic sushi eaters * ) . japanese food is my favorite cuisine and i 'm unimpressed , but if you are basic , you might like it ! their pork chop dish was alright , but again , nothing to actually write home about .. ? after i left , i realized the waitress didn 't even bring me my miso soup . wtf . granted , for champaign-urbana standards , i guess it 's okay .. so i will add a star . i honestly wouldn 't be impressed if i was taken here on a date . lol
asian	slimy grey msg soaked food . unless you have thrill-seeking issues ( base jumping is somewhat less risky than eating here ) , don 't eat here ,
asian	don 't get the 4 star average / never again
asian	we asked if we could have the wor wonton soup without calimari , to which the waitress responded with an emphatic " yes . " the soup came " with " calimari ! ! ! roasted duck curry was o.k. , but nothing extraordinary . the mussaman curry was also nothing to write home about ( we 've had better ) .
asian	still waiting on entrees . it 's not even that busy in here yet . wait times are way too long . food quality is tbd . better be worth it . not a happy eater right now
asian	their excuses are lame like the bartender quit so as the cook . the restaurant open 2013 and they still didn 't get the house in order . bottom line everything just plain suck !
asian	the food like bas a water added to the tika masla and was served . i would avoid coming again . it wasn 't a busy day , so no excuse .
asian	sushi was tasty but over priced for size and cuts . got steak and scallop hibachi and it was not impressive , 2 oz of over cooked steak and 2 large scallops cut into 5 small pieces , best part was vegetables . soup and salad that comes with hibachi was good and the choice of udon noodle instead of rice was a nice option . overall nothing tastes bad , but i know better japanese food for less . strange side note : they have hookah here . this can be good or bad depending on your taste . they were smoking hookah in the main dining and also on the out door patio . by the way ; hookah at a japanese place ? why ?
asian	those of us that had hibachi for dinner found that the quality was fine but it was way overpriced ! for a starter of dumplings and a main dish of chicken and shrimp hibachi , my tab was $ 40 . i might return to this place if it was half that price .
asian	sushi ... not so much . shrimp and crab were imitation meat . rolls were very heavy on rice ... more than should be in a roll . every roll was absolutely drenched in some sort of sauce , probably to cover the fakeness of what was inside . it 's a shame because i 've had really good sushi before and had high expectations of this place based on other reviews .
asian	had pad thai , too spicy and both shrimp and chicken dry and overcooked . thai ice tea , odd flavor . others had vietnam rolls , also tasty , bigger portion than my app . tom kai soup was quite good . 5 stars on that , but overall i was disappointed . 2years ago in desert ridge location , everything was so delicious ?
asian	for our mains we had the garlic shrimp and pad thai . neither was impressive . we were especially disappointed with the garlic shrimp - for the price we paid ( $ 10 ) we expected a much larger portion than the 6-8 pieces we got and a bit more substance than just shrimp and a few pieces of roasted garlic . we just added it to the pad thai . pad thai - good thing we ordered something to add to the pad thai because there wasn 't much to it besides noodles . i think i would have enjoyed standing in line for thai express at the local mall food court - that 's got better flavour than our meal today .
asian	i had a shrimp entree that was decent , i think it was the szechuan shrimp . but i also tried the hong kong style pan fried noodles and seafood . it was the worst dish i 've ever had at a chinese restaurant . we couldn 't eat it . just don 't order that and maybe you 'll be ok . like i said , the szechuan shrimp was ok .
asian	frankly this is very typical service for the last 2-3 months - we eat out too much ! i guess i should thank pei wei for the self awareness . eat at home kids ! best of luck !
asian	sign on the door says 9 : 30 . i get there at 8 : 55 and they say they stop taking orders at 9 . we stood there awkwardly because we were kinda caught off guard by that and then they said they could serve us , but made us feel super uncomfortable . it 's just annoying . bad business ethics .
asian	.. pad thai was unimpressive .... server was nice .
asian	we had the duck rolls , sausage , and oxtail fries . burger however was raw in the middle . staff and manager were terrible . the food usually makes up for the terrible service you receive at bachi burger , but no one i hate to say .
asian	i wouldn 't recommend it or go there again .
asian	soooo , i called archi 's " what 's up with the meat " a frank ( no pun intended chef ) said we were in fact correct , they had switched meat vendors from i believe sisco to a clearly less worthy option . today , i thought i 'd give them a 2nd chance and order something different , chicken satay . it was dark , fatty and less than chicken " y . " so i sent it back after eating a couple bites from 1 skewer . the waitress attempted to charge me anyway ! archi 's go back to your original meat supplier .
asian	when someone calls in to reserve a party of 15 you might want to stop and remind yourself that is a good thing ! ! not spew out some passive aggressive statement about that it is the busiest night of the week . our team will have their end of the year banquet at a place that welcomes business not some place that doesn 't want to be inconvenienced with the dreaded " customer . " good luck with your business model .
asian	on break from our exam cram session , came here with a friend to get some quick chinese food . my hot and sour soup ... was an oily thick soup of skimpiness . there was probably more oil in that soup than anything else . my friend 's wonton soup looked average , while her dumplings were super greasy . it felt as though we were eating at a chinese fast food cafeteria . in all my years as a student at concordia i never went to this place as it always appeared to be empty when i was walking by . i think now i know why .
asian	i 've been to this restaurant 10 + times with no real trouble . today i went back for the first time in about two months . i ordered the tonkotsu ramen , which i usually get . the pork was really overcooked to the point of being charred all around , the broth was lacking flavor , and the bean sprouts were noticeably old . there 's a lot of new people working in there too . i 'm really really disappointed in the experience . one other thing that 's been inconsistent with every visit . on the menu for the ramen bowls , it clearly says " slices " of pork . you get just one slice , every time , in every bowl .
asian	this broth was shallow and bland . wanted it to be good , but kept thinking , seriously ... you feel good about this ? the takoyaki and gyoza were above average ( for phoenix ) , and the bottled beer was cold , though .
asian	the lunch special offers about 10 or 15 choices including several curries , pad thai , and kung pao , or cashew nut to name a few . it is $ 8 for chicken and includes a soda . this is a little pricier than other lunch specials and frankly , not as good . i 've definitely experienced better thai food for a better price . that said , it is a cute place , with nice service .
asian	the location is always slammed and living local it 's nice to pickup and eat at home but after witnessing through others and first hand , the servers constantly get orders wrong and then you get stuck waiting close to an hour for your food . after this being my 3rd experience , we 've decided to order take out some place else .
asian	she seated us and then came to the table 3 minutes later to take our order- " are you ready " ( add attitude ) ... we ordered a few minutes later and she didn 't say thank you , or do you have any questions ... menus taken away with a sneer ... saw her leave at 5pm , barking orders to her staff . bad karma rolls downhill ms. supervisor / manager ... not coming back . rude .
asian	i used to come here everytime i stopped by vegas . last time i was here , the food tasted mediocre . many dishes were salty and unable to eat . what happened to the authentic thai restaurant that i loved ? : ( service , however , was good catering to our big group .
asian	for two chicken teriyaki 's and a small cup of miso soup it was $ 24 ? wtf ? ! it tasted like a frozen dinner . stay away and warn your friends .
asian	why would a japanese restaurant sell bulgogi ? although the food was average and i would give three stars for that , dining is not all about the food and the experience matters a lot . i came to the restaurant hoping to get a feel of japan but i heard the songs from all my favorite korean girls groups , girls day , tara , hyuna etc . that was definitely not the experience that i was expecting . but to those of you who aren 't able to tell the difference between japanese and korean , this place would be perfect to get some exotic experience .
asian	i was not even wearing my cloak of invisibility . we waited at the hostess stand for five minutes before being greeted ( even though the hostess made several trips to the podium without any acknowledgement ) and were then directed to the bar where we sat another five minutes without being greeted or offered a beverage . we did however , stare at the bartender while he ate something and ignored us . we went to roka akor .
asian	really , an insult for pho lovers like me . though , i did give this restaurant another shot with their rice dishes . ordered the rice with pork chops , steamed egg , shredded pig skin ( $ 6.50 ) . it came loaded with the shredded pig skin , a bite size steamed ( burnt ) egg , and a small piece of pork chop . and it was loaded with so much rice . never coming back from such an underwhelming experience .
asian	the replacement arrived at . 40 minutes . the menu is very very very short . we are now at 50 minutes awaiting our meal .
asian	you will have decent meal if you stick to a kebab and wrap it up in a naan ; everything else bathes in oil and frankly you can do much better elsewhere on gerrard east . what more , the prices will make you wince after you 've familiarised yourself with the plastic tables , cutlery and plates . an interesting experience - mainly due to the randomly hanging saris - but one i do not particularly want to repeat .
asian	tonight , the otoro pieces ( 2 ) i ate was served still slightly frozen . after eating the 1st piece , i left the 2nd piece on my plate and smashed it around off and on for several minutes . when i finally ate it , i could see the " small " water ponding . at $ 15 a piece , i believe it should have been served way better , if not , then better to eat at nobu . if only i had my phone to take a picture .
asian	i waited for 15 mins . w / o anyone coming to my table ! i had to go up and get my own menu and remind the staff i was waiting . go to wild thaiger or thai rama ... better food and way better service !
asian	the place was mostly empty . we ordered two soups and an appetizer . the waitress did some calculating on her phone , then announced that we had not reached the minimum of $ 9.95 per customer . she said our total was about a dollar short . so we left and went to a nice noodle place two blocks away . ridiculous and incredibly rude .
asian	i gave a 1 star review to try to call attention to the crispy red curry duck -- it was full of fat and gristle , comprising almost half the duck ! " chef suntorn 's signature dish " lacks quality and care , giving the impression this restaurant doesn 't pay attention to the food it puts on its tables . the website price is $ 22.95 while the actual price is $ 26.95 , further evidence basil thai doesn 't care enough about its business to update its website . thai taste on east blvd is a much better alternative .
asian	we went into an almost empty restaurant , waited more than 5 minutes , during which time no one acknowledged us , got up and left . in the past few years the service went from ok to terrible . i think we 're done bothering to even try .
asian	worst lemongrass chicken i 've ever had . worst taro smoothie i 've ever had . hands down . i was blown away with how bad it is being that it is in relatively close proximity to spring mountain rd . service was also super slow and they didn 't seem to care that it was . would 've been ok if the food was any decent , but nope .
asian	bad customer service ! get some employees to answer your calls if you expect to grow your business ! # fail
asian	have you had the chicken katsu without the curry ? it 's bland and tasteless . $ 38 for a dinky bowl of chirashi ? sure it 's fresh , but so is tarro and aoyama . the environment would be much nicer too . i 'm also not a starbucks supporter but save your money and get a green tea latte at starbucks instead . twice the size and matcha powder . i also have a feeling they invite bloggers to eat for free to get reviews . i saw at least 2 of them while i was there .
asian	are u kidding me people 4 stars had the spicy chicken bowl 98 percent rice chicken not spicy and the tuna roll well ........ the tuna piece was so small all you could taste was rice i relize this place is cheap but thats because so is rice
asian	are we sure this isn 't a " front " for something because they certainly don 't do chinese food well !
asian	welcome to a restaurant in america that gives you the authentic feel of a chinese communist working camp lunch room ! so great authentic and communist that they even refuse to make the american fries correctly . oh but make sure you eat everything or they 'll make you pay . if you decide to eat here , enjoy ! it 's time for me to go let the hershey 's fountain flow ...
asian	is small and not worth the $ 5 i paid . they put nothing on it . i 'm very disappointed . i will not be order from them again no one understands these days that when we pay good money for what we think is gone be good and it turns out to be shit it 's not cool . i have gotten other subs from here but this my friend is so horrible it makes me just turn away from it . next time i will just stick to my regular order .
asian	greasy , too ... i felt sick after eating here . my bubble tea nearly gave me a headache from all the sugar , and i usually love sweet things . maybe this is authentic , but it isn 't good .
asian	we ordered the sweet and sour pork , there was no pork . ordered chicken fried rice , it was not chicken . not sure what it was ? ‍ also ordered lettuce wraps ... basically the same as the rice doused in a strange sauce . and the free egg rolls ? don 't bother . save your money and time . might as well go to panda express . at least you know it 's a corporation who has standards ! my husband just got back in the car and said they were trying to refuse a refund and accused him of ordering food places and returning it ! lol you 're right qun zhang , that 's exactly what we have time to do
asian	it was hardly busy yet all the tables needed to be cleaned . at least four wait staff looked at me as i stood there without any verbal acknowledgment . needless to say , we left .
asian	this place is way over priced for a hole in the wall eatery . the rice is not good either . nothing compared to real hawaiian food . just a word of advice go somewhere else if you have ever had real hawaiian food or you will be disappointed .
asian	the concept is cool ... to have a place with mexican / chinese fusion but , i can go to carnival buffet for that . next !
asian	never ever again ! not to mention ... they didn 't deliver ! ! wth ! ! !
asian	five star for this place ? five star for the look . it looks good with many buffet table but . all long trays . i donno how the other guy get 140 items . i counted 100 with the sauce and raisin pickles thing like that . food not tasty at all . they are busy because they did lots of advertisement people are trying it out and the waiters , they expect a big tips just for taking the plates ice cream nasty ! all long trays . with drinks is 12 buck ! ! not tasty at all .
asian	how this place receives such a high rating is beyond my comprehension . the quality of the seafood was subpar , the restroom was unkept and the wait help was lost at times . i really don 't want to get into more details except to say save your money and go elsewhere , don 't believe the 5 star ratings .
asian	last time i was there , i walked in and three of the staff members were sleeping amongst the booths . food was ok but the service left much to be desired .
asian	this place sucks ass ! we came here for a late night bite . i tried the pho # 3 and shrimp rolls . obviously the people who give this place good reviews doesn 't know shit about pho . the pho was salty and the noodles were soggy . the service sucked too . the lady behind the counter was rude . make sure she doesn 't try to short change you because that 's what she did to us . if this was the last pho place on earth , i still wouldn 't come . bye bye .
asian	everything 's from the freezer or prepared the night ( or week ) before . dark , loud music . who ever heard of a plastic bento box ? an insult to japanese cuisine . cheap though , if that 's what 's important . pleasant service .
asian	this place lacks quality fresh fish and is very expensive for the type of food they serve . we got a small roll combo , and legit half of it was california rolls and rolls with sweet potato in the middle . if you want better sushi , head to north york . better prices , better fish .
asian	sashimis , spicy miso soup , teriyaki chicken bento for my son and some salads. the rice on the rolls were seasonless. the fish used on the rolls were so thin and insignificant that it was just rice balls. the shrimp was so over cooked and rubbery as well as the chicken teriyaki . i will not eat here again.sorry
asian	this place is guaranteed to exorcise you off of anything remotely japanese . this is the place that has the owner muttering " dumb ah-so " anytime any customer forks out money for their gut wrenching fare . after the experience you will be sure to scream " oh my poor raw ah-so " as you crawl out with nary a need to ever go back to associating with anything sushi like in your life
asian	sushi bomb is the place for you ! call now and secure a spot for your all you can eat rice at only $ 19.95 for lunch . that 's right ! you can have all the rice you want in your nigiri and rolls for only $ 19.95 . but wait ! if you call in the next 10 minutes , they will even include unrecognizable soft shell crab all mushed up in your sushi rolls ! what a deal ! that is all .
asian	this place is at best a decent option at an airport . the chicken dishes are stringy . the beef dished are tough . their fried rice is bland . if you are stuck somewhere and this is the only option , it will not make you sick . if you are not stuck somewhere , please yelp a non-chain chinese option .
asian	unsafe tempretures on the food , nothing was hot.homeless people in clear view of my table bumming cigs off anyone entering the place . they are also pushy when they bring your bill half way through your meal . they seemed upset that we used credit instead of cash . i 've noticed that many asian shops dont like that . bottom line is stay away from any restaurants that are located in wall mart shopping centers .
asian	are you serious ? ? ? ? $ 9.99 beef steak ? is this a robbery ? no comment .... not even a small cup .. wow tsk tsk tsk
asian	disgusting ! ! what they served me was more than a day old food recooked . i had some pieces of chicken that were hard as a rock ... i 'm not exaggerating . stay away .... far far away if you value your intestines .
asian	? i 'm livid ! we all ordered at 10 the guy said 40-45 mins then after an hour we were all starving and called to get eta .... just rang and rang and rang after 10 more mins we called .... got nothing ..... called again ... everyone went back to their rooms and hotels . at 11 : 25 the guy showed up ... i can 't eat all that .... we tried to cancel . ... i said sorry everyone left we tried to cancel after an hour and 15 mins ... the guy looked pissed at me then stormed off ........ not my fault ...
asian	we didn 't end up eating here . the place just lacked any sense of atmosphere and they tried seating us next to a family with a kid who was jumping up and down in the booth . we politely excused ourselves and headed out the door .
asian	cold dish : yellow tail ceviche , this is just ok as the grapefruit juice is too sour that cover the freshness of the fish . main course : washyugyu ... omg ... how you can make these tasty beef not even juicy at all ... or is it just a new way people like wasting $ here ? my bill comes to ~ $ 60 and , to be honest , why don 't just go to shinbay for a 3 courses meal ? don 't even put japanese food on your category . this is not japanese food at all . avoid , yelp is unreal for this restaurant
asian	this restaurant is so ugly . there is absolutely no ambiance . the food is average . the prices are high . i just don 't get it .... def a mistake was made coming here .
asian	it , let 's just get panda , " or you 've got a gaggle of screaming kids that won 't shut their mouths unless you immediately fill them with orange chicken , then go ahead . but if you have a choice , and a working brain , go to one of the dozens of local chinese places in the area . i recommend china tango .
asian	sushi . ever . may be we should have stayed away from the sashimi and nigiri . may be when we asked about omakase and the waitress didn 't know what we were talking about we should have just ordered some standard rolls off the menu . may be they should have given us some fresh fish instead of the wretched crap they served . may be upon seeing the dryness / lack of luster on the fish we should have just not eaten . may be that salmon roe was in fact not from a jar . may be i can recover from this horrible experience to enjoy sushi once again . may be . but probably not anytime soon ...
asian	price is too high lunch special is not special at all : ( i thought this restaurant gonna be my lunch spot since my work is just right here but i guess not .... so sad 1star is for the service ! but food was terrible do not pick beef ! not good : (
asian	this place had so much potential : great beer list , solid design and decor , and not too far from our house . unfortunately , they don 't have great sushi . they don 't even have good enough sushi to bring me back despite the beer list . the search for decent , reasonably priced sushi continues ...
asian	first time to this location . 6 : 30 thursday pm . no sushi . no silverware . no water cups . service like mcdonald 's counter . never again !
asian	i thought to myself " maybe i 've been getting things that are too difficult to make , i should just get the boba milk tea . " wrong . i had to spit out the icy , tasteless , pretty much vomit-inducing drink . i wish i spent the $ 4 on water instead . to tally up the three visits : 2 / 3 drinks i spit out . 3 / 3 drinks i threw away without finishing half of it . i need to keep this review here so i stop myself from coming . damn its convenient proximity to the heaven that is asian cafe express
asian	dim sum wasn 't really good , it was served warm and the other meals that we ordered lack flavor .
asian	i wait until 1200 pm to get back on the app to order but now it says " currently unavailable . " i wait and wait and wait and around 12 : 15 pm , i 'm able to place my order. i place it and it keeps saying it 's waiting for the restaurant to confirm my order ... nothing happens and my order expires . i place the order again and the same thing happened . i tried calling the restaurant 6 times and no answer . terrible service. just terrible . i wanted to try holy snack for the first time but i will never step foot or try this restaurant ever . i spent way too much time on this .
asian	what a mess . the food wasn 't tasty when it arrived - and it had taken forever to get the attention of the waitress for anything . in the end , out of a party of 4 , only 1 of us had received what we ordered , 1 of us was violently ill ( and remained so for days - having to visit the doctor , etc ) , 2 of us felt moderately ill later , and only one of us felt ok . such a disappointment .
asian	its a byow but not a place to enjoy a glass of wine .
asian	ordered the 20 piece dinner sashimi . the salmon was delicious , the octopus was super salty and overly chewy , and the tuna was too thin , brown and veiny and the other fish had scales . yuck . never again ! oh and service was awful .
asian	wanted to order a few rolls , it the owner said they would take too long to make . then the proprietor said the buffet closed at 2 , i pointed out the large sign on their sidewalk that clearly stated that they served the buffet til 230 . they did not want my business and i can assure them they will now never receive it . i was in the restaurant business for years and would never treat a customer the way i was treated by the staff at azn .
asian	they were not busy . didn 't get seated til 2 : 50 & got charged for dinner . brisket was tough . bulgogi had no flavor . pork belly was chewy . appetizers came out cold after the meat . took 30 mins to get a refill . service was awful . ordered the same thing 3x because they " forgot " to bring it out . the booth & floor was sticky from a spill they didnt bother to clean before seating us . waited another 20 mins for the check . bad experience from start to finish . so disappointed !
asian	the bartender was great and seemed to know the menu but that 's when things went downhill . very expensive for chinese . we ordered ( i went for the mongolian beef ) an hour and fifteen minutes later , we still had no food after repeatedly asking . the couple next to us at the bar had also been waiting . they arrived 10 minutes after us and she had ordered the same dish as me . guess what , her dish came out but we still had no food . really ? won 't ever go back , if this had been a pf chang 's in the states , the manager would be fired . we won 't be going back .
asian	arrived at 7 : 47 pm would not let me eat in only take out well i said i will go elsewhere to a restaurant that wants my business booo island foods bad customer service
asian	the place is beautiful and our server ( the bartender ) was friendly . unfortunately , the food was extremely average ; the miso soup was very salty , the rolls stomach able . we ordered 2 rolls ; one came out in a reasonable time , the other took forever ( 2 tables after us came , ate , and left ) ! ! $ 80 later ( 2 rolls , 2 sake bombs , 1 miso , 1 appetizer ) , definitely not worth . we are sitting at home eating wendy 's , disappointed and still hungry .
asian	ok it is friday night but the problem is that half the tables in the restaurant were empty and one whole side of the patio tables facing the yard house were also sitting empty . what in the world . shortage of servers or what . no excuse .....
asian	sign on the door said last call was at 930 which makes sense because they close at 10pm . however , when i walked in the restaurant the manager stopped me at the door and told me they weren 't taking anymore customers .
asian	that was the height of my experience . the waitress promptly took my order and then i didn 't see her again for 15 minutes . when i got her attention i reminded her that i was still waiting for a drink . 5 minutes later i got my drink . i waited another 20 minutes for the first of the 2 sushi rolls that i ordered . i had the filet mignon toban and red dragon . both rolls were average and i was clearly paying a significant markup for location . the rolls came out about 15 minutes apart . overall i was very disappointed with the quality of the dining experience and would not recommend for service or food .
asian	restaurant owner yelled " we close at 9 . " i asked what do you want me leave ? will you kick me out ? he repeated himself . " we close at 9 . " i was about to leave when a lady said that she would serve me . food was okay not great . my less than warm welcome left a bad taste . felt very unwelcome .
asian	some people came in behind me , and the hostess totally looked past me and seated those people before me . how rude ! needless to say they lost my business very unprofessional . but thanks to them i found a great new sushi place right down street , called sushi 21 people were very friendly and the food was great !
asian	only one other table was there . ordered a japchae and a bulgogi . portions were huge , especially the japchae . but huge portions most definitely does not equal good . beef was very think . same beef was used for both dishes . food was both way too salty and sweet at the same time . service was slow . the waiter never stopped by our table after taking our order . no one else came into the restaurant during the hour plus severer there . i totally understand why .
asian	ten minutes later another table arrived . we were the only two tables our entire meal . they were out of the first two drinks that we ordered . our order finally arrived 30 minutes after we ordered and 10 minutes after the other table ( who ordered after us and had more food ) . the kung pao chicken was flavorful but not spicy at all . we also had the godzilla & salmon sushi which were average . the empty restaurant should have been our first clue . our server did deduct $ 10 for the late meal , so cudos to her .
asian	the server was rude and didn 't answer my question at the door and made us wait just to answer a yes or no question . i had to ask the cashier . we ended up going to the other location . the other location at distillery district the kitchen closes at 11 : 45pm and the servers were way friendlier .
asian	it was busy when we got in but we were seated relatively quickly but after that , the service got shakey . we didn 't get tea , pencil to order , menu sheet , or soy sauce once we were seated . sadly we didn 't realize this all at once so we had to ' order ' these items individually as we realized that it was missing from our table . the food was standard . nothing particularly inventive and that standard selection was just okay . i 'm pretty sure some things were missed but we were full enough to not really care . random observation : their endame seems to have a bit more salt than other places i 've been to
asian	ordered a chicken souvlaki plate to go . the first thing i noticed about the lettuce is that it was completely yellow and rotten . the server scooped the rotten lettuce into my styrofoam takeout tray after which i stopped her and asked why it was rotten and not fresh and green . she proceeded to say it was fresh ! i pointed out the slimy brown / yellowy coloring on the lettuce - she went quiet and didn 't refute it ... she didn 't knock the price down a few bucks for this either ... no customer service . absolutely disgusting . never going back here again . buyer beware !
asian	upon entering i could smell something that was not pleasant . i was greeted and set . when i opened the menu it was filthy as though it had not been cleaned . the server brought me a water which had things floating in it . i had already made up my mind at this point to leave and then i notice one of the employees picking his nose in the corner . yummy right . i never identified the stench either . i left and went to booger king .
asian	nice looking decor . service was fair as they kept refilling our cups . food was lacking as the maki rolls were made with white sticking rice , so when i took the first bite it get stuck on upper mouth and immediately had to wash it down with water . white tuna was not fresh and tasted very fishy and rubbery . i ordered the crispy sesame balls but it never came after requesting it again the second time . overall service was fair so i still tipped for the service but food quality is still lacking . will i return ? not likely
asian	tried to order a few things family style ... hot & sour soup - neither hot ( spicy ) nor sour . seafood soft noodle - this didn 't taste like anything , except maybe for oil . cantonese sausage fried rice - best entree , but more sausage / egg / veggies would have been nice . chinese broccoli with oyster sauce - not bad . siu mai - nope ! all out . har gow - nope ! all out of this too . ugh . nothing was terrible , but nothing was that good either . i went here since i couldn 't face grand lux for the third time in as many days ... but afterwards i wished i had .
asian	host would not acknowledge our presence , wasted : 30 mins of our time figuring out whether we could get a table or not . terrible service .
asian	however ... some of the dishes looked like it was from the day before , just heated up . other dishes were pretty tasteless even after adding seasoning . my dad 's only comment was the following : at least the lemon wedges they offer were big slices . he squeezed lemon over a few of the selections to add taste . the service was awesome . i would hope so as there were less than ten parties in the whole place . plates were cleared right away and drinks were refilled right quick too . if i could give a half star , i would have rated this place 2.5 stars because of the excellent service .
asian	approx . 5min later host said there was a 25 min wait . we agreed to wait , a table for two . as we came back host didn 't recognize us nor had she wrote my name down . as we were seated the host had clearly just wiped down the table and seats with a wet towel not knowing we sat down and we 're very uncomfortable due to the fact that our jeans are now wet from the wipe down . i will no longer come to eat here . despise the fact that this was not my first time . i 've been here 3 times and all 3 times have been a horrible experience . i will take my money else where .
asian	in particular the lady running the binions $ 1,000,000 photo both who is evidently miserable with her life choices along with the guy you pick the picture up from . go for the free picture and get out .
asian	asian star goes for low cost and speed . there should have been nothing surprising about that given the setting of the restaurant . i had hoped for better on quality from all the four and five star reviews on yelp . i went on a slow night and perhaps the chefs were just off their game that other people are praising . but no family member could make it through more than a few bites of our entrees . far too greasy and breaded : a flavor-free zone which made for a very unappetizing experience .
asian	the shrimps are not prepared , the intestine still attached . the taste is very bland . the curry w beef is ... just ok . the meat is very minimal in a meal , about 6 thin sliced beef . chewy but not very fresh taste . my wife couldn 't finish her pad thai , too sour and the whole thing just doesn 't feel right . may consider this restaurant again if i m very hungry and in the area , but otherwise i will be put looking for a better thai restaurant .
asian	the folks who own the place are extremely courteous , but the vegetarian tofu dishes we ordered were dull as dishwater . we were looking forward to having their momos , but they turned out to be overly starchy . made with more dough than actual filling . it 's too bad , i really wanted to like this place .
asian	totally gross ! dirty , not many choices , taste like shit ! i wonder where are the good reviews from
asian	if this restaurant is in china , it won 't service more than one month . they do not pay attention to cooking , and bad attitude to customer . if you go , you are stupid .
asian	the soup is apparently just water with some soy sauce ... and the noodles wasn 't even soft ... the service was ok but the environment wasn 't good neither . a little bit to nosey .
asian	as a chinese , i will never go back to this place because the taste of dishes here is too disappointing .... never ever go back !
asian	this is really expensive and bad . it may suit your taste bud , but for me , really underwhelmed .
asian	with many new places opening i have to say that this place does not live up to the expectations . i do like the ' fresh ' interior , but food is far from acceptable . honestly , you would be better off getting your ' asian fix ' at chopstick and then grabbing a drink somewhere else . bac please don 't stalk me on facebook .
asian	the long line was promising . but they don 't use carts , and have to say that nothing was good here . from benchmarks like har gao to chicken feet . rather pricey . will not be back
asian	this one star goes to the environment-very clean by all aspects . the bowls of noodles looked good and tasted like taiwanese style at first sip . however here are the two points that cannot lure me back : first is the significant msg that took over my tastebuds quickly . second is that the noodles were not freshly cooked - let alone freshly made .
asian	one order has been worse than the next . the beloved gyoza ... burnt , half the pork in the fried rice was burnt . another carryout yielded flat and greasy egg fu young and the cashew chicken was stringy , the cashews sparse and the sauce tasteless . a third carryout yielded great spring rolls and crab rangoon and burnt asparagus in chicken / shrimp asparagus . we have decided to move on , there are other great choices not only on coventry , but taylor and other surrounding neighborhoods . too bad really , we love supporting local businesses .
asian	being in the heart of india town , i expected amazing food . we were two , and we ordered a " bombay chicken , " and a " szechuan chicken " both lacked the spice that you crave when going for hakka . the chicken was alright and the sauce was nothing to rave about . personally found the sauce to be a little too thick on both , and the lack of chicken was annoying . the chili oil was great , and added a much needed flavor boost to the meal . would i ever go there again , probably not . hopefully , i just went on a bad day . side note : we went during off-peak hours
asian	as good as their food is , this place seems to be opened at random hours , even after i confirmed via phone that they will be opened . i first called asking if they are opened on dec 24 and understandably they are closed . i called again asking about dec 23 and got confirmation that they will open at 6pm . got there aat 8pm due to a delayed flight and they said they are closed . as another reviewer mentionned , no matter how good your food is , please respect your opening hours and your clients .
asian	an hour 30 minutes for my meal to get delivered . with simple instructions ; address , name of apartment , where we were waiting . and the food i think was the worst part . i usually never write a bad review but this was a bad first experience .
asian	when i was working there , there was an infestation problem , but the owner never bother to fix it . i would check their restaurant health scores before you decide to eat here .
asian	i knew they weren 't so happy to serve me because i could hear the cook yell profanity in the background , i did not feel appreciated and comfortable . so displeased i vowed not to order at my former job anymore .
asian	the cheery cashier confirmed that indeed the chili chicken i so desired can be made gluten free ! well , be warned .... most dishes can be made with rice or rice noodles , but will still contain soy sauce . cross-contamination in the kitchen is also a real possibility . hey liberty noodle , if you are going to jump on the gfree band wagon , great---but then you have an obligation to be responsible . needless to say , i am having an uncomfortable afternoon .
asian	this restaurant just made me feel depressed . the decor is so outdated and in bad need of renovations . everything feel a little sticky , a little dirty . the whole time i was there , i was the only 2 tables that occupied the whole empty restaurant .... lunch special b ( $ 7.95 ) comes with salad / soup , 4 salmon sushi and 6 pc of crispy salmon roll . the fish itself was quite good .. the only thing i can comment on is the crispy salmon roll a little too heavy on the tempura bits . i don 't think i will be back again ....
asian	however their soup base is too light , need to add a lot of sauce in order to taste my food . the variety of food is not bad though . the drinks they provide kinda taste like chemical . if there are choices i won 't come back . but it 's good for a big group of ppl .
asian	this is one sad example of such revolting practice . this is not ramen , this is not even japanese . you are better off going to the store and buying cup ramen for 79 cents . comparing this garbage to monta is like comparing prime at the bellagio and sizzler . if you like real japanese food this is not the place to go . if you are so numb that you can 't tell the difference then this might float your boat . you should have been suspicious when there is a need to distract people with all the anime stuff . i would have given no stars if it was allowed , because that 's what this place deserves .
asian	this place was a major disappointment . this restaurant is a chinese restaurant trying to be a japanese restaurant . tonkotsu ramen was wrong in every sense , wrong broth , wrong chashu , & wrong menma . gyozas were more like chinese dumplings ( they are mostly pan fried at ramen shops in japan not deep fried ) , sauce for agendashi dofu was not right either . all wait staff were nice ( but slow ) , i just feel deceived about the food . i will not be retuning to dozo .
asian	broth wasn 't thick and flavorful ... if you cook and reduce the broth with the bones you would get more flavor , but it seems like they 've just added more salt .. the noodles were broken and too hard . tsukemen noodles should be soft , chewy and long . with the thickness of the broth and the texture of the noodles , the broth should really stick unto the noodle when consuming . if you 're ever in la , go to tsujita annex and you 'll know exactly what i 'm talking about . just go with the miso ramen at this spot .. or just go to la .. haha not one star because their asahi was super refreshing : )
asian	didn 't like it the first time , second or third . why is their la kalbi cooked in water ? ! dumplings tasted from a package and not homemade . this place made me sad .
asian	the place has completely become a place for for non-koreans , as a matter of fact on a weekend lunch i didn 't see one other table of koreans . the side dishes which come out first are complete disasters - they look korean but they are not korean , the end . the kimchi is extremely sweet ( red in color but so salty and sweet ) and the radish is also drenched in sugar you could feel the sugar grains . if the owner and the workers don 't eat their own food for lunch what does that say about this place ? i 'm quite sad to know that there are a lot of torontonians who believe that this is what korean tastes like .
asian	unfortunately , my experience today did not match the excellent customer service and food that i know and expect . i ordered the pad thai , but after 20 minutes of waiting , i was told that they had run out of rice noodles and could not complete my order . i was asked to order another dish and when that came out , it did not have all the ingredients as described by the menu description . i am disappointed in the handling of this situation as we received no explanation or compensation for the lack of ingredients .
asian	thought i would try sam woo in china town . food was good but service was very bad . the biggest disappointment of all is their " cash only " policy ! ! ! really ? ? ? this is 2013 almost 2014 . leads one to believe that sales are not properly reported to the irs let a lone the inconvenience of customers not able to use debit or credit cards . you have permanently lost my business .
asian	ordered the ginger chicken . this was swamped with way to much sauce . there was no ginger taste and it was super salty . should have gone with my gut and stood firm and not be talked into going . a flavorless meal .
asian	jeff leaned over the glass wall to take our order and deliver our food . he couldn 't even come around to the front of our table . he was clearing dishes and cutlery as fast as we put down our forks . he never even asked if we wanted another drink or dessert just put down the bill . sadly we will be visiting another location
asian	however , the drinks here , especially the slushes , are terrible ! i tried the watermelon slush and it tasted awful . they do not use real fruits at all and they are overloaded with sugar . the watermelon slush tasted extremely artificial and it left a weird after taste that reminded me of medicine .
asian	nothing to do with locale / service ... but everything to do with the lack of flavor and choices in the menu . soup was pretty good ( get the hot and sour ) but rest of the cuisine was very greasy and until i put 3 cups of chili peppers , i could not taste anything . i normally have very little chili on my chinese food but this place needed more . then the food was too hot to eat . basically , don 't read the local reviews if you are not from here . food is bland and not as healthy as advertised by some of the locals .
asian	as an asian , i feel like i should apologize on behalf of all asians for this craptastic place .
asian	unlike the comments before , they no longer serve traditional vietnamese dishes . we have tried a soup and 2 lunch sets on the menu . they seemed not bad to us , but there wasn 't any specialties ... given the same materials , we could have cooked better . really . don 't understand why there are so many french people here ...
asian	the portions are small and the pho is lacking in taste . in my opinion madison has very disappointing thai / vietnamese food . a lot of white people do seem to enjoy the food here so if you 're white come and if you 're asian seek another place : )
asian	however , the food was not authentic at all . we ordered multiple dishes and non of them actually taste like how they would taste in shanghai style . the meat in xiao long bao was pretty dry and hard , whereas it should be moist and tender .
asian	this was the by far the worst restaurant experience of my life . after a two hour wait , the food finally came . the plates were carelessly decorated and was very subpar . you can get a better meal at thai express minus the wait and the high end price . there was clearly a lack of service and the restaurant was evidently understaffed . i usually never leave negative reviews , however this restaurant experience stands out as one of the worst . our table was not the only one to experience this as there were many disgruntled clients who completely cancelled their orders due to the wait . would not recommend , not an enjoyable experience .
asian	that 's definitely a first and especially since they are next door to mekong market which is filled with different types of breads .
asian	the dumplings were great . we ordered a ton of food ! the soup tasted like dirty water , didn 't eat it . the beef and broccoli was great , i loved it . everything seemed to be alright until i was going to pay to leave . and just as i picked up my purse , a roach crawled up the wall . it ruined my entire experience . i threw away all of the leftovers and just tried to forget it . it 's a real shame bc they 're food is decent considering it 's in arizona .
asian	i dont have anything particularly bad to say but nothing really sensational either . good : fresh fish ( which is the most important thing really ) , very nice decor bad : small portions , poor service meh . i 've experienced better is as good as it can be said . tastes great though .
asian	food looked good . but a disappointment . they didn 't accept debit / credit . so i had to walk to 3 atm machines ! i came back , they gave me my change a dollar short ! oh how pissed off i am ! total inconceinance ! i was so pissed , i almost just didn 't come back to pay . i 'll never go there again . sorry . i know us asian ppl don 't like to pay taxes . but rich ppl pay lots of taxes so time to upgrade and pay taxes and do business a legitament way ! it pays off in the long run !
asian	once we got past that , we ordered the soup dumpling that were beef instead of the traditional pork . surprising flavor , very good . we had the shrimp dumpling which we both thought had too much egg and onion and very little shrimp . the beef patty was very tasty but a little greasy . very few dumpling choices considering the name .
asian	however , i was disappointed with our first experience here . the food was good , but not good enough to justify the bad service . if the food is great , i can overlook a ( very ) non-attentive server , a tight seating area , long wait , etc . the noodle man is all of these without the great food . don 't get me wrong , it was good , just not good enough to make up for bad service . we had to wait a while and flag down multiple servers for our menus , drinks , a spoon , you name it . it was clear they had no interest in making this a pleasant experience for us : /
asian	anyway , i 'm not mad , just kinda wanna tell everyone , if u got any other a choice , just don 't pick this one
asian	the original staff still works at the eastlake location ( which i have also reviewed ) and the new buffet right down the street from this one . i have not been to it since it changed hands , but from what i have been told , it is absolutely terrible . please don 't let my original review influence you into choosing this out of the other options . the better buffet isn 't more than a block away .
asian	i expected it to take a while , based on other reviews . i did not expect for it to taste bland and awful . i ordered green curry with veggies and tofu- thai hot . horrible . wasn 't the least bit spicy . won 't be back .
asian	they were not even close to what lanzhou noodles should be . the broth was bland , the noodles had terrible texture , and i was very disappointed . also , the soup dumplings had a strange flavor . it was a waste of carbs , and a waste of a meal during my time in vegas .
asian	that would tend to indicate that pittsburghers are clueless as to how pho should taste ... so i 'm not even going to try it in another pittsburgh restaurant .
asian	their ramen looked good in the pictures and i told myself it can 't be that bad . well , i was wrong , all items were way over priced , $ 4 for just little bit of extra noodles . a bowl of ramen easily double the price of true authentic " ramen satouka " at mitsuwa marketplace torrance , ca . and the soup broth didn 't taste right . gome-house soup tasted okay but shoyu just plain wrong . i am not even trying to compare them with the ramen places that i visited in japan . save yourself some money , just cook some instant noodle at home instead .
asian	the ramen i ate tonight is too normal , the soup is under seasoning and too thick almost like sauce . the karaage don is basically just chicken popcorn with mayo and rice . only the chicken balls are really good , bouncing texture and great mushroom sauce . im a culinary student , my comment might be tough , but i really thing that as a new restaurant you guys should have a shining dish and do other dishes with heart , instead of showing 3 normal dishes that everyone can do and serve to customers .
asian	especially the workers who stand around directly facing at you and watching you eat when you 're trying to enjoy your meal , i do not enjoy people even the workers staring who are not doing anything during their shift . to add two male workers i won 't mention their names to keep their position as a busser . if i have to eat and constantly look up to see him arms crossed and staring are very bad for restaurant ethics . please hear this report and stray from this poorly instructed service here . enjoy my review . please support and read . pass it on .
asian	none the less , i wanted thai food and i wanted it close as it was cold out . i 'm quite confident the pad thai has ketchup in it . it 's probably some of the worst pad thai i 've ever had .
asian	but the service was horrible . may be it was because on a labor day weekend , but the waiters and the owners themselves were very dismissive and wanted to get rid of us . and it wasn 't completely filled too . the restrooms were so horrible that my parents did not even enter it to wash their hands .
asian	they removed all cuban items from their menu and the pictures on here are no longer menu options . they also removed a large number of their sandwiches and dinners so all that 's left are the greasy , fried tender meals and some mediocre asian food ( on a street that already has 4 other established asian restaurants , mind you ) . if it remains this way , i do not foresee myself or the group of people that i always went with ever eating here again .
asian	the menu looks amazing then when you get the food , everything is loaded with rice . not only that .. it doesn 't taste the same as other places . it 's different , and not in a good way . was my first time and will be my last . neither of us enjoyed our dinner . at least if the price was lower than average it would have been okay but it was on the higher side of ayce restaurants .
asian	the cut rolls are expensive and definitely regrettable . the rolls were sloppily put together , small , plus they only gave you eight rolls considering the average price was about $ 17 . also there sashimi was semi chewy . great sashimi should melt in your mouth ! granted most sushi bars are expensive in las vegas ... but i have had better sushi for the same price at restaurants on the strip . i would pass if i were you . go to shibuya at the mgm .
asian	i was so not impressed by the quality of the food . the way the rolls were made to the quality of the fish , this place did not impress us . i guess being a ayce sushi place , we should have set the right expectations . i will not be coming back to this restaurant .
asian	no salmon ( only smoked ) , and the rest of the ( small selection ) of fish has always been fishy smelling and questionable quality . i 've been here 3 times and its mediocre at best . sake selection is small , 1 or 2 low end choices . however , to give them credit , they do have a good beer lineup and their cooked japanese style food is very good . service has always been excellent .
asian	as we were in line , the cashiers held up the line and they wanted us to pay for the dinner price . i explained to them that they held up the line to cause the change . they told me that we should have come 2 hours before the cutoff . " really " ? so , the advice . get there 2 hours early . we won 't .
asian	the result was a tasteless , kung pao chicken , a tasteless fried rice , and c + egg rolls . not cheap , and a disappointing experience . i chose the place after reading some of the 4 + stars on yelp . in any event , caveat emptor . i will not be returning .
asian	came in the other night around 8 : 30pm , wasn 't busy at all , we were sat and waited almost 20 minutes before we were even greeted at the table , after we ordered we waited another 30 minutes for the food to come , our pad thai was cold , and they forgot our other plate , and when it finally came it was burnt . and that still would 've been okay but our server was unapologetic and didn 't seem to care . i work as a server as well and know things can get busy and mistakes can happen and i am sympathetic with that . but the overall service was bad , slow , and the food was disappointing .
asian	wrong . pork , chicken and shrimp comes with it . the lack of clarification is less than appealing and i won 't be returning to bejing express . their inability to recognize the confusing menu is absurd . bye .
asian	fragrance and flavours are not right . their noodles aren 't even , and food quality seemed old . service and atmosphere are just borderline bearable to alright .
asian	i don 't think the place lives up to the hype . my tomato and tofu sandy was a little dry , but it was filling and cheap ( they recently hiked the price to 2.50 , still a good deal ) . overall , it was a good cheap lunch but i like my viet sub from ginger 's better ( even if it 's an additional dollar ) .
asian	as bad as it gets .... biryani is just average ... u can get better biryani in kabob palace or chennai fusion in chandler and chennai chettinad or mayuri palace in north phoenix .
asian	was given a tiny glass of water when we first sat down , and was not topped up even once after that . found a long black hair in the puddle of sweet and sour " sauce , " which is not necessarily the dealbreaker for this review - but rather the tired , bland stuff they try to pass off as food . i guess i expected a too much for a $ 7 meal that was prepared in about 2 minutes . also ordered won tons as an appetizer , however apparently that order consists only of the wonton skin / pastry , deep fried . basically , won ton skin crackers ...
asian	an absolute scam . we live in new york , and good food can be expensive , even for izakayas . but this was an absolute scam . the seared tuna was meh and was basically a tasting . tempura mediocre . and on top of it , the waitress was implying it was our fault that we had so little food , because we didn 't let her help us with the order . never again .
asian	friends and i went here for dinner . the place is not as crowded as before . as they claim it is holiday season , they do not offer group meal . we ordered four dishes . food came really fast . the food portion is really small . one of the dishes is beef with black pepper sauce . there is only 4 piece . the most disappointing part is the dessert . they normally give tofu pudding . it is my first time seeing this dessert without water in it . if i have an option , i won 't come anymore .
asian	it 's not cool to pay 100 $ for dinner after got food poisoning .
asian	it was like someone poured very sweet spaghetti sauce over chicken . i couldn 't even finish it . the palak paneer was ... okay , wouldn 't get it again . everything was quite expensive for the quality of food . i won 't order from here again .
asian	the lady seating people ( the manager ? ) is so smug , it 's as if she is doing you a huge favour for seating you . don 't you dare asking for a table for 6 .... but the worse thing you could do is ask for a high chair . she will laugh at your face . the 2 stars are for the lovely server with the cedric tatoo and the food was good ! but definitely not worth the wait .
asian	and for being special i didn 't feel the items were too special . usually you get lunch ( read cheaper ) prices , but you won 't get out of here under $ 14pp . the portions are a decent size , perhaps appropriate for the prices but they are a bit big for lunch . i think they should shrink the portions and prices to be better value . if you come here you may want to consider if sharing is possible . the food itself i didn 't feel particularly interesting . if i see people say lower prices i might come back otherwise there is too much competition .
asian	very much not to the standard of bellogio casino this restaurant service and food should get better to the 5 star rating or should close down .
asian	all cultural and other idiosyncrasies aside ... when " wing " ( seemingly one of the senior managers ) literally snatched cash off of our table before we even had 30 seconds to look at the bill and then says " ok " while motioning to get the hell up and out of his money making seats . . . . it just leaves a bad taste in any customers mouth . smarten up .
asian	the fish is sliced wafer thin and placed on top of a heaping mound of rice , making for a not-so-appealling nigiri sushi . the rest of the food was ok . the gelato bar is great , however .
asian	not ! the portions are tiny ! even when we ordered 7 different things to share ..... they just brought single portions and it was like a tasting party . we each got 1 shrimp , 2 pieces of steak or chicken , and some rice . we left hungry . also my brother must have got a bad shrimp because he was sick for 2 days . skip this place ! only reason i bothered going was the view of the fountain . big mistake .
asian	there wasn 't a single saving grace dish , which is basically impossible for any restaurant . highly highly do not recommend . lotus buffet is right down the street , much better food across the board , and less expensive .
asian	i got buddha bowl and seems like there was more rice than veggies . the taste was not that great either .
asian	as far as hibachi goes , this is pretty low on the spectrum. the quality of the food is not where it should be for such an expensive , pretentious place. it 's right in yorkville so you can expect the clientele to be a bunch of dicks , but i don 't need attitude from the waiters too. food is below average and very expensive. masa a few blocks east is better but still not good .
asian	we were seated by the door , and it was super drafty . they refused to close the outermost door ( we tried , they explained to us why the outer door must be propped open .... ) . with every order , we had to wait 30 minutes for they do deliver some raw food , i don 't understand why it takes so long , and about half of the stuff we ordered never came . the plum juice was watered down , there was never any cilantro in the bucket , pro : their magnetic plates that only heat up the pots are cool cons : pretty much everything else except service / servers attitudes , service was solid .
asian	meat is lacking in flavor and is pricey unless you come during happy hour . better off going to ayce at tofu hut and deal with the wait . it 's also always strange to me when they don 't give rice at start and you have to request it as extra .
asian	it 's small and cramped . the bathroom is dirty . if you sit near the front you will be blown by freezing cold air conditioning . not the kind of atmosphere one would enjoy . the food is decent - no different than any other second cup . if you want to enjoy yourself i 'd suggest going to their other location across the street , or if you want to stay awhile and study try the second cup that 's a few blocks down the street on harbord and spadina ( at grad house ) .
asian	but the fact that only a handful of the businesses and restaurants here are actually chinese is ironic . to the left , there is yuyu and to the right , a dim-sum place , with a grocery store anchoring one end and the mall in the middle and no. 1 boba inside- volcano boba ( also in the plaza ) is a better pick though . there 's better chinese food found elsewhere than this plaza specifically , and the parking / driving is a little on the dangerous side if you get my drift .
asian	overall , it was a very bad experice , will never go back here again. for real sushi , go to sushi on trop , still # 1 in my book
asian	i wouldn 't go back and if you want a hot bowl do yourself a favor and go to yc 's instead .
asian	2 stars for good service and a nice setting ... i 'm docking 3 stars for my food being over cooked and not being offered anything to replace it , and our chef not doing any sort of classic teppanyaki cooking tricks ( making oil light on fire , flipping shrip at people , bouncing his utensils around .. ect ) . decent place to eat , but not a value for what you pay for .
asian	my most recent visit was disappointing . the green curry and the starter lemongrass soup that i ordered were essentially the same dish . had i known that , i would have gotten something else for one of my courses . my waiter could have spoken up . the buffet looked ok but i was having a lunch meeting so we opted to go with the menu , which may have been the wrong choice . i won 't be rushing back here any time soon .
asian	haven 't been to thai thai in quite some time , since i like to get lunch and they ticked me off as well as dejai treating me as someone that must be kidding when i request thai spicy. that irks me as much as small portions. waiting for my take out at thai taste , observed peoples meals coming out and they looked more appetizing and plentiful than the food i took home .
asian	so i wouldn 't drive there unless you call first .
asian	i had the pepper steak , chicken diced with vegetables , and steamed dumplings . everything was fried ( except for the dumplings ) and the fake meats were too soft and tasted cinammony . very strange flavor . i couldn 't eat it . waste of money i should have known better * * the service was good . i wont come back again . : (
asian	as fast as the food service was the food itself was not appealing. meat was bland as it could ever be. would not recommend coming here. it 's just a bunch of poorly seasoned meats and vegetables tossed into a bowl for a somewhat reasonable price. never coming back .
asian	the food quality is not excellent , their online menus vs what is offered for all you can eat are not accurate , and the cuts of fish / quality is not great . it is a place you go to indulge in great quantities not quality . would not recommend . bathroom was really messy as well and difficult understanding waitress : (
asian	average service . flavorless food . yes there is lots of food that looks good but does not taste that good . and they charge more than the advertised price . don 't waste your money .
asian	they 've wisely turned this old house into a european restaurant with big paintings and dropping chandeliers . the food however is a a far cry from their beautiful interiors . unfortunately interiors can 't be eaten . i would come back to try their dimsum at some point sure why not , but the place would not meet my go-to place / comfort food .
asian	i went on a saturday night and the place was empty . the food was horrible . i will not be going again nor do i recommend others to try ... the dhaba down the street is much better .
asian	arirang bi bim bhap costs $ 12 but quality of ingredients would be closer to $ 5 . i told the chef and waiting staff that their food was awful and if this is their attempt at quality food then they have missed the mark . if i could give a negative star then i would had done so . i will never return .
asian	in the last year , coincidentally around the time the owner died , i think it was the owner .. whatever the case , in the last year this place has taken a turn for the worse . the food is progressively getting horrible , the wait times are long , i will go back but i don 't think it will be anytime soon , sad day .
asian	pork was overly dry noodles lacked any flavor . the only thing that saved dinner was the yakis . those were freshly made and delicious ! i would come back for those but other than that really nothing special .
asian	we stopped by for a light lunch break from blackjack . it 's quite expensive for so-so standard asian fare . $ 8 for 5 pork dumplings , $ 17 for a big bowl of seafood noodle soup , $ 8 for a pot of jasmine tea . quality of the food was nothing special , which made it harder to pay so much for mediocre chinese food . good clean decor and service though . oh , and we liked how there was a slot for your soup spoon on the edge of the bowl -- no more accidentally losing your spoon into your noodles !
asian	chin 's fails in all three areas . i guess i learned my first midwest lesson : when in wisconsin , eat as the wisconsinites do ! ! !
asian	it was intresting , just not something i want or crave . the kids love it , its fast and convenient . no frills , nothing memorable , it is what it is .
asian	don 't go here if you 're looking for an authentic taste . i went because of all the hype . i was highly disappointed when i tried a couple of the dishes . if i took my asian relatives to eat here , it would be an insult to them . basically , it is take out in a fancier place .
asian	not asian food at all ! ! " went with them last night , sushi were warm . other food item taste awful . totally not authentic , just a rip off !
asian	i ordered a few small plates , since the prices were cheaper than even basic takeout . the tom yum soup was one of the biggest mistakes i can recall in recent dining experiences . it was a consistent sour oil slick that caused heartburn after consumption . the egg rolls were grease sponges that i felt compelled to eat , hoping this roughage could clear my throat . even with a bill of around $ 7 , save your money and buy p.f. chang 's frozen food for a better meal . avoid at all costs !
asian	i have tried a few other dishes and at least give them points for trying - the meals typically look colorful and appetizing and with enough fish sauce , chili paste , or soy sauce , you can transform it into something edible . other pros , the dishes don 't seem greasy which is a plus to me . the prices are also super reasonable .
asian	the food was horrible , they 're serving dumplings and rice at a premium price . if you have money to spend and want asian food because you don 't know what it 's really about , then this is for you . i guess they have a great business plan geared only towards americans who believe in this crap . on the side note , they offered great service and i really liked the ambience .
asian	they quality is not even half of the other one .
asian	jus ' sayin ' .... for a reason . so , i came here with my dad for dinner and we ordered : spicy beef noodle soup - big enough for 2 to share , - generous amount of beef , but was not very tender - soup base was not spicy and needs to be more concentrated - noodles tasted plain , but pretty chewy spicy lettuce - crunchy and juicy - absolutely drowned in chili oil ( which made it more spicy than the noodle soup ) - presentation was very unappealing sweet and sour chicken -this plate screamed msg with its neon orange colour - suprisingly there was a lot of chicken meat instead of flour overall : like i said ... asian legend !
asian	the cucumbers looked like they were frozen along the way and the mandarin orange sections were total mush . couldn 't even eat this and i eat nearly everything . tomato basil soup was fine .
asian	" sounds good , right ? the food was edible , but besides the tiny ( and expensive ) portions , there was nothing else memorable about the food here . the decor is modern , but i felt like there was no vibe to the place . why go here when there are so many better establishments to go to ? mmm mediocre and overly expensive food ! eek ! methinks not .
asian	i 'm all about service and getting my pick up order wrong is already an upset . but to not apologize and to try to justify their mistake is ridiculous . i 'm sure the food is good but the service is horrible as soon as you walk in .
asian	when the waiter finally came to me he just asked what i wanted and not the drink order first . when the soup came it was the wrong one and was just egg drop soup with vinegar . when i got my meal it was the wrong order completely . the waiter did not come over to see how it tasted but only delivered my dumplings while we 're mushy and still had water that they boiled it in , inside the actual dumplings . if you like general asian food come here but if you 're looking for tasty original asian food there are better places .
asian	you 're better off at oishii bento . food is absolutely inedible -- disgusting . i ordered sesame chicken and fried rice . the chicken is dark meat and becomes chewy in your mouth . it 's very unnappetizing and you end up having to spit it out . bubble tea is fine . this place is a waste of money and time . schenley park tourist trap .
asian	that 's amateur . people don 't come here for the charming atmosphere , they come here to have it their way , right away . one star !
asian	aside from the fact that i tipped on the card already , he gave me a really vindictive look as he was leaving . never ordering from this place again , christ .
asian	they have this rule of time limit and food remains that 's essentially never told until we begin got the bill . seriously , if you do care about service quality , don 't even think about this place . my most candid advice .
asian	i was not impressed with any of the dishes the first time i visited that i decided to try it again . i would come back here if i was drunk late night and there was no other eatery open in town .
asian	the waitress was taking our order and pauses to take a call from her personal mobile phone .. what kind of waitresses do that ? ! ? the drinks are still expensive and taste mediocre . one cool thing is they have really innovative mahjong tables that help you stack it together .
asian	sushi " chef " s were laughable ( being taught as they made my dishes ... really ? for a 30 $ dish ? ? ? ) , service was slow , having to remind the waitress over and over for even a glass of water ... and the quality of the dishes mediocre . unless you are offering to spend at least double the amount worthy of the actual value of food and service , i would highly discourage anyone from visiting this establishment . if you are looking for a classy , japanese restaurant with a bar , i would go to umi - soba on ellesworth st. in shadyside .
asian	the decor here is just about the same . the ac was not as strong as i was expecting , but it was satisfactory . there was no wait to be seated . after we ate here , i can understand why . the menu here is slightly different from the one in la . it appears that there are less items available to order . the dishes that we received were lacking in flavor , marinate , and sauce . they cuts were also not as good , or perhaps we got the bad pieces . it was all very sloppy . service was just okay- good . there was nothing else particularly noteworthy . i would not condemned and will not be back .
asian	it was dark and quiet , and that 's about it . i was starving by the time my food was served and i would 've thought anything tasted good at that point ... except i was wrong . the dim sum ... it might as well have been made in a pizzeria . it tasted like nothing . my har gow was just wet and bland . my beef chow fun ... also very wet and tasteless . sooo overpriced . and sooo not worth it . service sucked too . i had never met a such presumptuous ( asian ) servers in my life . luckily , i didn 't pay for that dreadful meal !
asian	egg tarts good . not worth experimenting though if you 've never been here . i think there was seriously only one vegetable dish , and chinese eat a lot of vegetables . so , it 's that kind of " chinese " buffet .
asian	how could you possibly not notice that before delivering our drinks . makes me question the cleanliness of their kitchen . anyway , that was obviously the final straw for me , i decided to not even wait for my food after that , and instead went to eat somewhere else .
asian	i decided to venture into this place again to give it another chance . i tried the fried egg with beef dish this time . extremely salty and kind of gross tasting . it was supposed to be beef but it tasted like mystery meat . never again !
asian	white rice only ! i should have just left then . ( healthy , shouldn 't brown rice be a choice ) ijs . but i prefer , fried rice , yes , i know it 's not a healthy option , but i would have liked brown rice instead of white . i got the 1 / 2 and 1 / 2 chicken and steak . the steak was chewy , so all i could do was pick out the steak. ughhhhh , i new i should have just gotten the all chicken . the bowl was just a disappointment ! i won 't be going back . but check it out for yourself , it might be something you enjoy !
asian	i had to stop a waitress to get out mushroom soup that should have came an hour ago . do not come here . the half price is not worth the 2 hour dinner duration . as the food is good . there service is terrible . they speak very broken english and make it so u don 't get confused and just nod and say ok . ughhhh i want my food ! ! ! update 1 hour and 13 minute . i swear they forgot our order and when we questioned them they just acted stupid . finally left after 2.5 hours . ughhh waste of a wednesday
asian	she didn 't answer the question but looked away and smirked . it was obvious that her husband knew that she was being rude so he answered the question for her . i told her that i don 't think it 's funny . she replied , i don 't think it 's funny either . strange and rude . i used to go there every tuesday on my day off but will not go again . in this day and age with many vegetarians , she shouldn 't find the question peculiar .
asian	when i inquired why this occurred the sushi chef stated " sometimes that just how they 're made , in different orders .... " unacceptable ! not coming back .
asian	yyyeeaahhhh ... sooooo .... the food is still not good . i got the mongolian beef and it 's like " wha ? really ? is this irl ? " i 'm a chinese food kind of a fan , this restaurant , i 'm not a fan of .
asian	that being said , the food here was simply " okay " at best , even during normal dinner hours . with so many other korean places in the area , you can probably do better . i was also a bit disappointed - we had a group of 8 and asked if cheques could be separated and they said they couldn 't do more than three cheques for our whole group . i get that it 's tough to draw separate cheques but if we ask in advance , doesn 't that make it better ?
asian	there were 2 other tables eating . i got water in a dirty glass . there are no vegetarian options here . they will however add veggies for an extra charge . well why not pay extra for what usually comes standard ? don 't we all want less for more ? i got a lukewarm chicken pho with what looks like synthetic chicken , i don 't trust it . i 'm serious . i ordered lemonade and a get a glass filled with ice and 2 tablespoons of lemonade . this place is a waste .
asian	to start with , the waiter never asked for our drink orders . a simple mistake that could have been overlooked had he not later disagreed that i had not ordered ikura and brought out something different . he proceeded to stand over me , taking the plate while yelling to someone else at the table . i have ptsd and anxiety and this was a trigger . the photo attached is everyone having their meal brought out except one individual . the waiter had forgotten to bring it out and took another 5-7 minutes to do so . he barely gave us time to eat before asking for if we wanted boxes . good food , disgusting service .
asian	service was friendly but slow and it was really bad-we had to ask several times for multiple items . food wasn 't that good & sauces were strange . they didn 't have the traditional ' yum yum ' sauce or the traditional hibachi sauces-just an fyi . there are also several menu items that were not included in the 50 % off nights but that 's not specified in the menu . if you want hibachi , try somewhere else .
asian	nakji dol pan ( octopus stir fried with chili paste ) was spiced properly and pretty tasty , but had no contrast and was getting monotonous tonkatsu ( breaded pork cutlet ) was pedestrian kimchi and accoutrement were also pretty bland. eh eh eh
asian	i 'm pretty sure the chicken is seasoned with beef flavor top ramen spice , and the pad thai is made with the noodles from the same package . i contemplated finishing the food but i think i 'm going to have to wave the white flag . never . again .
asian	the things tht i liked were tandoori chicken and kabobs but the biryani was not up to the mark ! the dahi bhallas were old not fresh and shahee tukra was very oily . on the whole its a good place to have dinner with family
asian	? fill it with crab ! crunchy roll ? full of fake crab ! philly roll ? full of fake crab ! california roll ? full of fake crab ... and a tiny bit of avocado ! worst sushi of my life .
asian	i told her mind her manners . the small draft beer is 7 dollars ! total rip off . the food was half way decent . i will never go back or recommend this place .
asian	i should 've walked out then ) , the woman that took my order was very rude ( sighing , rolling eyes , etc ) , my order was wrong and i was charged for something i did not receive . if you really want to try samurai sam 's i would not try this location .
asian	as i approached the hostess and saw there were probably 25 tables still ahead of us , i asked how long is the wait ? she replied with 20-40 minutes . ha ya right . but i really wanted ramen so i put our name in . we proceeded to go across the parking lot to a bar for a drink . 45 mins later we headed back , we got there to find that only 4 tables had been seated in that 45 min time frame . ( no surprise ) -- we waited another hour and gave up . she ended up calling us 2.5 hours later telling us our table was ready . hahahaha. no thanks !
asian	not many people in here but , but jenny is spinning . i see other customers upset and confused . people wanting to order and others wanting to desperately pay . i continue to wait , but this place clearly is understaffed . as i hear people leave , they didn 't enjoy the restaurant or the food . and i too left ..... did i get service ? no , i was completely ignored . customers leaving gave me good enough feedback that this place needs to up their game or just close down .
asian	asked for a honey dew mellon boba they do not offer it ... offered me a winter melon instead asked what was in it and no one new ...... finely they said there was fructose and other unhealthy ingredients in stead ordered a green tea instead still waiting on my order there is more employees then customers so far not happy st all ...... two thumbs down they gave me a a greeted boba with fructose corn syrup and told them i did not request that ..... i got a full refund be careful to much unhealthy sweeteners in a drink not good for u oh boy over all i will never be back sorry offer healthier options and i will be back .......
asian	asked for a side of sriracha and got this so wrong just laziness so sad smh could have gave my the plastic little cups but noo lazy
asian	it was super bland and boring , and in no way worth the $ 10 just for a bland veg soup . when i got up to get some sauce from the corner , they threw my stuff away . what a garbage experience .
asian	spring rolls were good . not good compared to all the good pho around the area . would never go back .
asian	pre-paid , waited 2 hours and didn 't get the food . i had to call them and they said the driver was " lost , " but didn 't bother to call me . horrible service . i will never order from them ... if they manage to stay in business somehow .
asian	in addiction , the attitude of one of their staff was terrible .
asian	ordered chicken vermicelli and there was barely any chicken in it . would not come again .
asian	will never come here again also mentioned i wanted a certain dish and they say the price is higher than advertised . also with regards to the pad thai we only asked for broccoli and noodle and light suace . 4 little pieces of broc only .
asian	also their definition of grilling seems to be what an average person would call frying . taste is fine . otherwise not satisfied .
asian	she just nodded . curry was sugary ! also regrettably ordered coconut shrimp that had no salt ! no salt ! avoid this place and go to khao san road instead !
asian	whole dish tasted like burnt food . bummer . owners seemed nice .
asian	no crab rangoons . over priced , sub-par food . would not recommend .
asian	i got about 3 pieces of chicken for my bowl and the rest was veggies . and it tasted like shit . don 't even ask for their hot sauce cause it 's not even hot . i threw it out and ordered somethings else from the food court . save your $ 15 for a bowl and a bottled water for something better .
asian	asked for them to bring change $ 100 they said no problem the driver gets to my place says he had no change for a $ 100 had to leave my apartment to get my own change the worst customer service ever
asian	just so you know fried rice is made with fried eggs . i simply got up and left and just said " sorry . " # sorrynotsorry
asian	after a nice meal including dessert , as my wife and i were still drinking our tea , not yet ready to leave but almost , our waitress asked us to leave or relocate to the bar area , and make room for a reservation . i thought this was rude and not customer friendly at all .
asian	never got back to me . also purposely ignored me when i raise my hand to ask again , the lady just looked away and then again at other people . and just walked pass by me and wet me . smh . never coming here again . please find other places .
asian	because twice in a row , boxes with sauce are placed on top in the bag insecurely and end up spilling out the gravy all throughout the rest of the items in the bag , including egg rolls on paper bags which end up soggy and soaked with the spilled sauce . create a process that prevents sauces from spilling out or quit putting sauced items in paper boxes that can spill out the top . like the plastic boxes . use those . so another wasted egg roll , a mess to clean up and rinse off the rest of the containers . extremely inconvenient and unsatisfying experience .
asian	spend just a few extra dollars and get some chinese that uses real ingredients . really ... it 's not worth it just to save a buck or two .
asian	whilst the meat was of a good quality the sides were very poor . every table has sides set out and leaves them dry and unappetizing . also they are unable to prepare hot drinks - a restaurant that does not serve hot tea - what is this about ? ? ? i will not return : (
asian	i 'm just glad i did not introduce somebody to filipino food at this place , i would have been embarrassed . maybe i just went on a day they were experimenting on flavors .
asian	friendly owner and fresh / moderately priced beef is all that bring me back . if i lived near asu , i would probably go a lot more often , but as it stands , there are more moderately-priced asian grocery stores to choose from ( like lee lee , mekong , asiana ) .
asian	a small spider at my table - the guy killed it and whisked it away like nothing ever happened .
asian	this could be a decent place since the food is not that bad , but with one sushi chef and one server ( on most days ) this place needs to think about service because people are not going to wait 1-2 hours for a meal ( and this is a consistent problem at big eye ) .
asian	the food 's really standard americanized chinese fare and it tastes pretty decent -- it 's pretty much a not-so-greasy / non-greasy alternative to asian kitchen and i personally find them a bit better tasting than asian kitchen in general .
asian	however , this location is horribly mismanaged . the staff , some friendly , some not at all , differ from every other pf chang 's i 've ever been to . hostesses are absolutely horrible . wait staff are friendly , but disorganized and slow . there 's no sense of urgency . our waiter , who was absolutely gregarious , but slower than molasses in january , couldn 't run my credit card . " the manager has to do it ... " wtf ? ? ? replace the manager with someone who gives a shit , and the place would kick ass like every other pf chang 's on the planet .
asian	it was the service . during our entire dining time , they cleared out dishes multiple times before we were finished with them . we had to stop them quite a few time . for a restaurant that intended to situated themselves as a " classic " restaurant , the service is beyond subpar . no wonder it was quite empty during dinner time on a long weekend .
asian	and , for what you get , it is definitely overpriced . compared to other buffets around town , this one is just slightly below them - again , the price is a bit steep in comparison . as for the food , there is a rather large selection . however , the food was kind of bland . i am not sure which item caused it , but i had an odd metallic taste in my mouth afterwards . i would recommend looking elsewhere . if you want sushi for about the same price but at a better value , try ru san 's in charlotte .
asian	personally , i was not a fan of the dishes that were served . i feel like those who loved smoked dishes would like it very much but as a person who does not love the smokiness and strong fragrance food , i did not enjoy it too much . also the portions were really small for the price it was offered for , my friends and i ended up going for ramen after lol .
asian	they do use fresh noodles - i think ( they are wider and much more slippery ) . nothing special , a bit below average because of the skewers , see below . the chicken satay skewers were a huge let down . the chicken was not marinated whatsoever . the satay sauce is a chinese style satay , not like a peanut style satay i 've had at other pho joints .
asian	maybe because i 've waited too long to finally review the place , but i digress . the sushi selection was okay , but the rolls themselves were a bit dry . their eggs benedict was average . i could actually whip out a better batch in my own home . i guess i 'm spoiled , seeing as i 've dined at the likes of wynn and m resort . their buffets have no contest with ti 's .
asian	this happened to us as a couple of times already . we 've asked them a couple of times and they said we we 're next after an hour . another 45 minutes have passed said we we 're next . 5 groups were seated ahead of us as they indicated they made reservations . it is sad to say we walked out because we were felt neglected as others are being seated . from a customer service standpoint , this is unacceptable . other than that , their food is good but their seating system needs adjustments .
asian	being their competitor pf chang 's is next door you 'd think these guys could step it up ? service is fine but food bland and fish refrigerated tasting and looking .
asian	it could 've been cos ' there 's so many customers , kitchen overwhelmed . one day i was amazed by the plentiful portion of noodles in the bowl . another day i look at the sad sauce poured on separately cooked meat . for now , i designate this a fill-d-stomach on cheap destination is all . 2.5'd
asian	we are regulars on this place we come as much as once a week . he gives you attitude , does not greet us and is mean . i think customer service should be a priority . sadly they lost me as a client .
asian	the bathroom wasn 't working and the right half of the restaurant was shut down , only leaving 3 tables to the left open . we felt so rushed while we were eating , they were giving us to-go boxes while we were eating and the lady that served us even picked up the tip while we were still sitting and had the nerve to ask us why our tip was so low when our bill was $ 70 . my sister and i were so pissed and felt so disrespected .
asian	it wasnt the staff , they were great but the food was mediocre and the place is just falling apart ! the seats are ducttaped together and the carpet is disqusting ! the place would do so much better with a little remodeling ! the fish i had was very fishy and the sides were over salted . i dont think it was the chefs fault as much as the prep cook who got it ready . i was really disappointed in the food qualty and have had better meals at take out establishments . for the price i would pass until i see progress .
asian	today i ordered a curry dish for lunch . they gave it to me in a paper container , so when i got home it had leaked everywhere . and i didn 't receive a salad like the menu said i would . just disappointed .
asian	i 've called five times , even making sure it was the right number by confirming on google . i just want some takeout ! geeze . revision : i saw a different number on their website and asked to place a takeout order . a man asked to call him back in 15 minutes because he wasn 't at the restaurant . i asked if anyone was there and he said no . am i in the twilight zone ? !
asian	the manager made my order she was in such a hurry everything was tossed together . and her portions were not consistent . my daughters food was missing the orange chicken . not driving all the way back so they can make it right . next time we 'll go somewhere else
asian	we showed up in the drive -thru no answer so we drove to the window and the workers only looked at us . we continued to try to get their attention but all we got were looks and laughter . after honking several times we finally got someone to the window with a clueless face of how can we help . we decided to leave since this business doesn 't understand customer service . looking for a new panda to go to .
asian	the ingredients are different in toronto and don 't taste as good .
asian	a snoozer , there 's quiet and peaceful and then there 's ' put you to sleep , yearning for some of the vegas hustle atmosphere ' - i get it , mondrian is a quiet , respite , no gambling and smoking , but the restaurant was so dead on a wednesday evening that it seemed like they were actually out of business .... the sushi was solid , but the ambiance + staff was like a stepping into a vacant spa with random ceramic pumpkins adorning the space overlooking the strip -- choose another spot
asian	i didn 't like the food took it back to them because the food had a very uncooked taste then i ordered another dish , the chef and owner i think came outside to me and verbally attacked me saying i was making this up . i barley had two spoons of the food and put it back down . the least you could do was give me another dish and i would be on my way . i didn 't want to argue so i just left . i paid $ 32.00 and walked away with no food , i was visiting from seattle definitely will remember this horrible experience . do not eat here save your money go somewhere else .
asian	it is being turned into a new business , a korean fusion style restaurant . according to the new owner , the business shut down about 6 months ago .
asian	) . i haven 't seen mention of this in other reviews , but considering the challenges of preparing sushi alongside these issues makes me very , very hesitant to ever come here .
asian	it 's been considerably renovated and there 's a greater number of items available . the prices are a bit higher , but soft drinks are now included . the people running it are the same and their approach to cookery is the same . if you liked it before , you 'll like it now ; and if not , not . i live right nearby , so i regard it as a useful neighborhood resource .
asian	as of january 2015 appears that both the yakitori bar / seoul food company have closed ( window are all papered over-inside is being cleaned out ) --not sure why this failed--but clearly the number of customers was slowly but surely declining ( some evenings only saw a few people eating there with the waitresses essentially talking to the cook ) ---i hope they put an italian place in here next time--i understand it was supposed to have been a wild wing but the other restaurants stopped them from getting a patio liquor license
asian	not sure if the chef has left or change of management , but food was being brought out cold and portions were inconsistent .
asian	i decided to write the review and time myself until it gets to my table . the food tastes great , great quality , inside looks hip . but alas , my food is taking a while . i waited 5 mins to post ... 20 mins total for a rattle snake and a chicken teryaki roll .
asian	when opened it wasnt the best but not that bad for a slimey area location .
asian	my experience with 2 ladies here have ruined my chances of ever coming back . one of the ladies that goes by the name of kristi ( cashier ) is very rude and very unprofessional . this is the second time i 've ran into her with a bad attitude . you may not like the place you work but complaining to the customer and having a very negative attitude isn 't going to help much . today i called customer service around 754 to ask a question about an item and once again i was treated with an attitude . i 'm done with this store .
asian	sushi rock started going down hill around 2011 and continued to plummet to levels below belief , especially when you consider the highs it once soared to . i just wish i had the recipe for the sauce they used to toss their fried calamari and shrimp in . the place smelled like it had been cleaned using rancid dish towels and their sushi smelled the same the last time i was here ; dirty menus , bad service and overpriced portions are the only things left here . buyer beware , i wouldn 't be surprised if everyone walked away from here with food poisoning .
asian	for lunch i had a 3-roll lunch special for $ 19 - the rolls were a bit on the small side , and some of the more basic rolls ( tuna , california and one other one ) . it 's also quite noisy and a lot of bay street boys that i don 't really care to be around . yuzu 's prices are on-par , but quantity / quality is better . based on the high prices , i 'd go somewhere else .
asian	my parents took me here with a family friend once because they heard positive reviews from their friends but it was the worst sushi i 've been to in a while . their sashimi were sub par and ratio of rice to raw fish left much to be desired . their cooked food were ok , because the only thing i can really say i liked were the tornado shrimps which were huge and fresh .
asian	i ordered the general tso 's chicken ( $ 13.49 ) . it didn 't come with rice so there was a $ 3.99 up charge . the chicken was dry and tough , like it was leftover from the previous day . i hadn 't eaten all day so i forced myself to eat it . hopefully , i won 't regret it later . i will update my review if i end up sick .
asian	i usually eat here every time i shop for my basic korean supplies . most of the dishes i ordered were tasteless and old . even my old standby , fried korean dumplings was tasteless and greasy . also the personal hygiene of the front cashier / food handler was outrageous . she was coughing and sneezing into her hand and not washing . just could not take it ! won 't be coming back again .
asian	however , the quality is not up to par . the rice paper was thick , rubbery , and coated in oil . the basil was non-existent and the cracker tasted bland . at least they tenderized & seasoned the pork well ; so perhaps get that w / rice or noodles instead .
asian	the presentation was nonexistent - they just slop it on the plate with no attempt at making it look like anything other than that they slopped it on the plate . the food quality seemed ok but not impressive . what was really a turn-off is that they have shark fin soup on the menu , for anybody who knows how shark fins are obtained . surprisingly , for a place that advertises as a dim sum restaurant , they really didn 't have that much dim sum on the menu , and so we ordered something else . probably more chinese friendly than non-chinese friendly , sort of the place that you take your family for chinese -- if you are lukewarm on your family .
asian	the overall impression is that they don 't really care about customers . we were needlessly made to wait for a table and after much waiting without any information from the staff had to " seize " one that cleared up , otherwise we 'd had to wait longer . the cashier messed up our bill . however , this restaurant is the only place in montreal at the moment that serves these kinds of desserts so they can afford to act as a monopoly and treat customers as a nuisance . let 's see how long this advantage lasts . the restaurant itself is very loud so try getting take out instead .
asian	the salad wasn 't really fresh but the ginger dressing was passable . the soup wasn 't horrible but i bet it was just a beef bullion cube . the chicken teriyaki isn 't bad . good portion size , small veggie portion though . good alternative to fast food .
asian	there are apps for delivery drivers , useful for guidance and directions . once , i ordered and they brought me the wrong item . they did the right thing and issued a refund . was peeved but that happens . another time i order and 15 minutes later i get a call saying it can 't be done , the driver is sick . that was annoying , if deliveries can 't be done they should make that clear so we don 't waste our time ; which they did on the eat24 app after hanging up with me . not sure i 'll order from there again . food is decent , although once the chicken was undercooked in some spots .
asian	fried seafood , decent lobster roll , other non-impressive dishes. good for a few drinks and a quick bite if in the area .
asian	there are many other sushi bars in and near the area to have to settle for this place - and i work right next door .
asian	when the cashier was told about it , the reply was " he didn 't know . " is it ok to eat other peoples food off of their trays and make excuses for it ? very disappointed .
asian	i had the general tao , some noodles and the mixed vegetables . ( only brocoli )
asian	no napkin or cutlery ... am i suppose to eat with my hands ? ? tired of feeling like a burden to employees when i enter an establishment to order food . it is your job--if you don 't like it , quit . is there any caribbean restaurant in scarborough where i can go and receive equal service ? you clearly see the demeanor and attitude change when a customer comes in who is , how can i say ... not white . on my list of never agains , along with sunrise and a few others . i liked it much better when the asian ladies worked there .
asian	also got chicken wings n pint of sapporo beer ( $ 3.80 ... couldnt resist ) .... broth in ramen was ok , thin noodles style ramen ( not my thing - not what im used to when ordering ramen ) , cha shu and egg were cold ... wings were interesting - half wings styles , deep fried but soft .. wasnt hard or wasnt soft . wasnt sure what to make of it ... the batter was kaarage style and flavorful . would i come back ? probably not because so many better options , service was the best thing they have going on for them ... id rate them 2.5 ... but yelp only has full star ratings ...
asian	dumplings were okay but lacked the flavour and oomph i want in chinese food . some disappointment in non-dumpling fare . yes , clean and cheap - but need more bang for the buck .
asian	there was a wait for a table but leas than 15 mins . menu was pretty standard but pricing seemed high for a bowl of noodles . 7.95-12.95 ... our table had tokoyaki to start which were great but again pricey at 9.95 . also tried the tuna fish onigiri which was quite tasty . some if the ramen brother was spicy and from the non spicy section so that was a bit if a downer .. then we were promised a 20 % discount and was never given it . want to give thus one another shot , but it will all depend in if we can find something better before the ramen itch
asian	i had the royal milk tea with tapioca . the drink just tasted like water and cream powder and there was next to no actual tea flavour . the tapioca was also quite bland and way too soft and overcooked . my friend had their signature wintermelon foam drink and she says that it as okay but nothing special . with all the new competition here in this area gongcha would not be near the top of our go to tea shops to visit . on another note , why is it so dark in here ? it 's eerie and does not make for a comfortable environment as it is already quite a small space .
asian	now , there wouldn 't be a problem coming here and paying that if the quality matched the price . last time i was here it cost less and the quality was still great . today how ever was another story . the meat had extra fat and easily identify it as lower quality cuts . if the price didn 't go up of they quality change i would mind paying the 8.75 they were charging a few weeks ago . i would not be coming here again . a little longer drive for quality food in which you get what you pay for . time to look for a new spot
asian	the rice is poor ( not remotely seasoned ) and laid too thick by their rice spreading machines . the freshness of the ingredients was acceptable , but not impressive . the roll was quite overpriced for what i got . i guess this place is alright if you want heavily americanized sushi fast , but with sushi boat and oishii bento right on the same block , i don 't know what anyone is doing eating here .
asian	the place is clean and employees are working hard , but the food is terrible . first off , this is not japanese food . it 's advertised as such but it is a chinese restaurant . i really hope people don 't eat this stuff and believe its japanese .... as a japanese person , that makes me want to cry . anyway , i ordered a $ 9 bowl of ramen that turned out to be instant ramen . it was the first time i had a broccoli in my ramen . terrible .... people do not eat here unless desperate .
asian	and like her , there 's no way to know for sure that it was this place , but this was the only place i ate out at .
asian	honestly , it was such a surreal experience with the completely oblivious attitude of the server , i can 't put it into words . the sushi was actually very good , but , wow , the server gal was dumbfounding . she was slow , non-responsive , and spoke in cryptic language , while my wife and i looked at each other like we were watching an odd movie or immersed in a nightmare of a dream ... wow .....
asian	this place was the pits . very small selection of non-raw rolls . it seemed like all they offered was california roll with this and california rioll with that . i was very disappointed in the selection and it is really cramped in there . it was ok , but i have definately had much better
asian	to sum up a really bad review , the lines and wait times are abnormally long ( i really don 't understand why people rave over chakos when there are much better kbbq places elsewhere ) , the food is really average , service could be better , and they have a terrible ventilation system - the whole place reeks of this greasy charcoal smell that makes me lose my appetite . so no , i won 't be coming back here unless every other restaurant in the world closes down . even then i 'd probably think twice about paying another visit here .
asian	" the fish is precut and minuscule . the rice is dry and crumbly and the quality is as low as it can be without being a risk to your health . the avocado salad had only white iceberg lettuce and the miso soup was so thin it was like water . the tamago was frozen and cut into triangles . for $ 36 it was a colossal rip off compared to even the other bad all you can eat places . to cap it off , the decor is so empty and bland it reminded me of an unfinished old folks home lobby .
asian	i ordered the shrimp bahn mi burrito via grubhub , and i 'm truly hoping the wrong item was delivered . firstly , the burrito did not have any shimp in it and comprised only of dry rice , large pieces of vegetables and jalapeños with a warm mayo sauce and warm cucumbers . the flavor was not at all of a bahn mi .. any pickled vegetables were masked by immense amounts of american rice , there was no cilantro , no semblance of bahn mi flavor . disappointed by the order inaccuracy , but moreso over this restaurant underestimating their customers ' knowledge of vietnamese cuisine .
asian	when i called jabo 's to ask abour gliten free options , the host didn 't really seem to care , and didn 't seem to know what she was talking about . she told me all the meats and sauces were gluten free , so i decided to come in.when we got their , i wanted to double check with our server , who had no idea what items on the menu were gluten free . after checking with the kitchen , it was revealed none of their sauces were glutwn free , and almost none of the appetizers . overall bad experience , and wouldn 't recommend this restauraunt to anybody with allergies or dietary restrictions , as the staff is both unknowledgable and uncaring
asian	the miso ramen was better than with the black fungus one . forgot what it is called , but i was scared of the fungus . also we got the steamed pork bun , not what we expected . honestly we are all about ramen republic , maybe we like " trashy " ramen , but its consistent and yummy .
asian	i got two dishes that i always get at other places ... general tso 's chicken and beef pepper steak . the general chicken had no heat and was almost flavorless , the chicken was pretty dry too . the beef in the beef pepper steak was tender but this sauce had no flavor either . i decided to try a new place because of all the great reviews and i was passing through this area , i am so disappointed . the customer service was the highlight of the place . but that won 't bring me back .
asian	just because my other family members are dinning at hong kong garden for dim sum does not automatically mean that everyone is looking to eat there . i was and had a craving for deli sandwiches in which i did ended up walking in to purchase 2 as planned ( receipt still in hand ) . don 't go around assuming and start off with horrible service . i ended up keeping my car parked there the whole afternoon taking a space just because that lady was rude . * * * also would be nice to offer water for your customer that is waiting for his to-go order * * *
asian	once my entree arrived ( chicken larb ) the servers only came back to my table to give me my check . they didn 't check on us once . even after we made eye contact . the larb had too much onion and rice powder . it was way too gritty . i finished a 3rd of it .
asian	after having stood by the door for a good minute , one of the waitress motioned me to a table . didn 't hand me a menu or asked what i wanted to drink . right then , a chinese ( ? ) couple came in . they were greeted warmly and escorted to their tables . i 'm filipino by the way . 3 more minutes of waiting and nobody came to take my order . i just left ...
asian	and i was not wrong . i went to wash my hands only to find the dirtiest bathroom i 've ever seen . i lost my appetite after that . pretty sure there 's a lot of health violations . if the bathroom was this dirty , i don 't even want to imagine how dirty the kitchen is .
asian	i ordered a pho tai . the noodles were very soft , and seemed ? overcooked ? . the broth was tasteless . the meat was soft , but a good texture i think . i actually wouldn 't mind the noodle part if the broth had more taste . the place isn 't dressed up , but is a cozy place for something casual .
asian	we still put that aside and tried to give this place a benefit of the doubt . we waited to get seated and no one came to us to assist us . finally we got someone 's attention and the guy told us oh they 're close . first off we got there at 8pm and this guy insisted to say they are closed already even though they had clear open sign . i remember liking this place years back but this time it left a bad taste in our mouth . i won 't be surprised if this place closes one day .
asian	few minutes later we were told only buffet and it was $ 12.99 . with no other choice we went for buffet .. choices were limited and food was very much below average in taste ! finally when it was time to pay the bill , we were told the cost is $ 14.99 .. when we said we pointed out to the person who seated us , the manager ( ? ) , i apologize for him but the price is $ 14.99 .. most importantly the quality of the food was very poor and i will not recommend this restaurant
asian	i ordered the ramen and this is by far the worst taken i 've ever had , noodles were not cooked properly and the broth tasted sour . i also ordered the katana roll and the salmon was not fresh and really warm . other than that our server was really nice and took this time to explain the menu .
asian	the service we received was short and shorty . the associate kept leaning on the other side to talk to her coworkers . she didn 't keep eye contact and was very unprofessional . the chow mein was missing sauce . it was simply just the noodles dry ..... the roach was still there by the time we left . this is unsatisfactory and disgusting . i wish no one has to experience this again . im assuming its bad luck considering i also did not get my fortune cookies ..... wow ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
asian	we ended up paying 46.00 for nothing but rice horrible mushy tempura with only 2 shrimp and a dried out piece of salmon . i asked not to over cook it . my husband ordered the steak and asked for it to be med well and it had blood running out of it . she offered fried rice but didn 't tell us it was extra . we had water but somhow our bill was over 46.00 with our groupon , don 't go here it is a whole in the wall , felt very dirty and gloomy . they are very dishonest
asian	but once you step over to the sushi bar the quality immediately drops . from the dried out rice , to the limited options of sushi selection . maybe it is a different atmosphere and variety during the weekday but at 4 : 30pm on a saturday it was a waste of money . on a positive nite a couple next to me order the hot pot and it look nice , wish i had order it !
asian	however , my husband and i were very disappointed with the quality of the food despite all the good reviews i 've read . i ordered sweet and sour pork with fried rice and my husband ordered a chicken dish with plain chowmein . boy was that chowmein plain tasting alright and unfortunately so was the rest of our food . the only thing i enjoyed were the fried wonton strips .
asian	it 's nothing spectacular , but it 's filling enough . maybe i 'll return to try something more interesting , but i 'm not in a huge hurry to do so . i hate downgrading , but today 's visit was kind of icky . i had a student special again , this time with added vegetables . they drowned the vegetables in more gooey teriyaki sauce ( the chicken bowl last time had just enough to be tasty ) , and they were blah vegetables ( celery and cabbage , just short of overcooked ) at that .
asian	it 's pretty hard to mess up pot stickers and friend rice . it somehow they managed .
asian	a.better choice would be yc 's at indian bend near the 101 . this place was not big on being clean and tidy . ingredients were not fresh looking on bar . presented a bowl that host had his fingers in . asked for another and was accommodated but he looked stunned . all in all a mediocre experience .
asian	i 've experienced better . " i came here for dinner because i saw the awesome reviews , but after ordering their oyako-don , i was pretty disappointed - the flavour was subpar and the rice itself was non-traditional . their maki rolls ( we had their spider roll ) tasted pretty good , but again , meh , i 've experienced better . * cough * inaho * cough * as a bonus , though , they have free parking behind the building , so yay for convenience !
asian	we had some sort of chicken dish - it had an overly sweet sauce with way too much soy sauce and only after i was half way through did i realize what was really wrong . the chicken pieces appeared to be the preformed chicken nuggets you get from any fast food joint smothered in a disgusting sauce . you can get better from the freezer cabinet at safeway . beef chow mein was tough , greasy and bland .
asian	only highlight was the summer roll . to be avoided unless desperate . had the penang chicken curry which had 6 small pieces of chicken and an overload of overcooked veggies including peas and carrots . do they not know how to make this dish ?
asian	this buffet was one of our poor judgements and we regretted it at the first bite . the food was cold , there was chinese noodles in the middle of an ' authentic ' indian buffet . the chaat was up to the mark but everything else seemed to be a let down . the food was cold , the naan was rubbery , the rasmalai was spoilt , the spread wasn 't impressive , the malai kababs were tasteless etc . the service was good though and very welcoming , we also really enjoyed the gulab jamuns . everything else however was a sad excuse for indian food and i would not recommend this place to anyone i like .
asian	white picketed fence , a patio with mismatched furniture , small and family owned ... i really want to like asuka .. but ... lunch special weekday till 3 pm from $ 9.95 this is the first time ever i ate a chirashi ( $ 13.95 ) that has shari rice served microwaved warm .... the fish got a little warm because of that too ... i feel sorry for this nice waitress / sushi chef / cook .. she is the only one here .. but that way how she prepared my lunch makes me not wanting to come back again .
asian	not enough sauce , tho more just made it less dry- not taste any better . the cashier seemed annoyed that i took her away from her phone . and all the condiments ( salt , pepper , and soy . no sriracha ) and utensils are behind the counter . you have to ask for them . but i really didn 't want to because i didn 't want to bother her anymore than already had by coming in ... if you want good- no . great teriyaki- goto grilled avenue instead
asian	sushi rolls are small , taste bland , plus the service is horrible . we ordered a bunch of rolls and the waitress forgot at least 3 items , plus she forgot our drinks . avoid at all cost .
asian	staff didn 't appear fazed by this , we left our meals mid way and left the restaurant disgusted . we were charged the entire bill regardless of our experience . interesting .
asian	while eating her rice and chicken , my daughter found a bunch of hair in her mouth . she immediately threw it out . safe to say , they lost a customer .
asian	they were thin , undressed , and only flavor was spicy . no amazement what so ever . reminded us of the sushi rolls at local supermarkets . maybe one day i 'll try the hibachi , or better yet maybe not .
asian	then as we complete our order , they tell us they don 't have an item . this place isn 't worth dinner time . everything was breaded to doughy with no meat .
asian	not a good sign if the cooks won 't eat the food at their own restaurant . my wife and i bought the groupon , and sampled a few things from the menu . we shared a shrimp ball , which was huge but lacked seasoning . we tried a couple pieces of the dim sum , which were tasty but falling apart . we also tried a platter with the noodles , orange chicken , and walnut shrimp . the walnut shrimp was a highlight of the meal , crispy and flavorful . but the orange chicken lacked flavor , and the noodles had way too much onion . there was more onion than actual noodles . we probably will not be coming back .
asian	when we tried to go look for a seat he then put his phone away to ask us how many people is in our party . after we all got seated we put in our order . 3 out of the 4 people got their foods while the fourth person waited for the food to come out . we kept looking for our server and asked the other server for our food . no one even came over to acknowledge us until the 3 people were done eating . there were no aplogies or anything . never coming back here again .
asian	a staff member did pursue to roach but i was unable to confirm his kill . i still decided to give this place a try and it legitimately made me feel sick and it was not my first sushi experience or anything like that . i don 't know if i 'm just really unlucky but non of the sushi from the conveyer belt was even kinda fresh . my recommendation is to pay a bit more and actually enjoy your food and not struggle to finish .
asian	this use to be a great go to spot , wish i knew what happened , just not the same .... my favorite combo used to be beef and chicken . the whole meal was not awful but the beef taste as if it 's been under lights all day , and lots of fat . this has happened on more than one occasion , this just maybe my last time ...... first the fat boys breakup now this ... so sad .
asian	in other words , just ok . you won 't be wowed nor grossed out from eating here . you can get your dim sum fix and forget about it . perhaps if you 're new to chinese food or looking or something outside of panda express , you may find this place decent before going back for the orange chicken at panda .
asian	" and bonchon don 't make no difference to me . i don 't recommend this place . truly disappointing . the first thing--that i 'm still not over--is the rotting raw chicken smell that hit me as soon as i walked in . i was looking for the yummy cooked chicken aroma . we came for the wings but they were out of the spicy sauce for wings . they only have two kinds on the menu so how do you run out ? we also had the bibimbap with bulgogi which was ok . nothing amazing . not sure how this place made the eater list .
asian	second time stopping by and was not greeted until i waited five minutes at the door . omar sat , the waitress had a fan on my chair and didn 't move it for me to sit down , waited another 7 minutes and no one even showed up to offer water . we left . never again : - /
asian	i 've never had szechwan beef noodle soup , so it 's hard to say if i 'm simply not a fan of it or if it was just not done well . the noodles were extra soggy and the ' beef ' was all fat . i should 've trusted all you fellow yelpers and not ordered this . lesson learned . i will say , the woman who rang me up was nice and , as previously mentioned , their chrysanthemum tea is good ( $ 4 + ) .
asian	i 've had amazing food and its not always expensive , usually not . i just expect quality and care in any dish . i was craving thai food and went to thai rama on a recommendation based on dinner my sister had there 3 years ago . i always order thai beef salad at a new thai spot ... sort of a litmus test . it wasn 't my favorite . loads of onions , no tomato and no cucumber and no mint . the spice level was nice , good flavor . the beef was way over cooked and far from the medium rare juicy i expect . i 'm not sure i will be back
asian	wrong ! i have eaten here twice and ended up with the worst food poisoning each time . first time i though i was just sick but few months later when back in vegas , we came here again since my friends wanted to do the seafood buffet . it happened again . i have no idea what is in the food or how fresh it is that makes me sick every time . on the second trip 2 other friends also got sick . i don 't know what others experience is but i am not coming back . the casino is fun but this buffet makes me too ill to return .
asian	i had the dim sum sampler , half of which i enjoyed , but the sodium content is sky high . six hours and several large glasses of water later , my mouth is still dry . i did not add any condiments either !
asian	that should have told me something right there . i placed my order , the grill had to be heated first ( because why have the grill on when you don 't have any business , right ? ? ) waited for the food to be cooked . got the ground chicken kabobs . they tasted like there was a whole lot more filler than chicken in them . and then , i felt sick to my stomach the rest of the day . threw out the menu i brought back to the office with me , and threw out the frequent buyer punch card cause i 'm not going back there !
asian	the dinning area is tastefully decorated and the service is fair but the food is truly made for the city of whitby , and like whitby it is nothing out of the ordinary , exactly what you would expect , bland or filled with soy , etc . it is one of the better sushi places in whitby and i would recomend going there but they haven 't made a regular out of me .
asian	they said they were closed , that they had already " thrown the food away . " we got in our car and watched a family of 4 or 5 let in to the restaurant , so they fed them . we went to another viet namese restaurant and it was delicious and cost less ! we will be going back to the 2nd restaurant !
asian	but we came in in a relatively large group & my fiancé did not receive her first roll until an hour after she ordered it . most of our party also had large waits as well . the taste was fair to average , nothing to complain about , but there are better tasting sushi restaurants in the valley . a manager was extremely nice & tried to help out , but an auto-gratuity on the check was definitely in bad form after the very poor service .
asian	the prospect of watching food cooked before my eyes teppanyaki-style or the variety of options from the bento boxes was always an exciting adventure . the lunch menu options are reasonably price , though the dinner pricing fairs close to the price to an all-you-can-eat japanese dinner buffet elsewhere . with the emergence of so many japanese restaurants around , it had dampen the once crowded atmosphere to a quiet few around the peak lunch hours . quality of food has definitely gone downhill compared to it 's once glorious days , and for the price you pay for just mediocre food , most customers decide to go ayce instead .
asian	the staff are really rude , saying there 's only 1 size for the pho bowls when on the menu there 's a small and large . not recommended for big parties also .
asian	the salmon was really good , the tuna was terrible and left uneaten . i 'm not a connoisseur by any stretch of the imagination , but bleh . overpriced , substandard , major fail .
asian	called and complained , to the manager of the restaurant who was very uncaring in her demeanor and claims that no one else called in a complaint today . we will never eat here again . avoid this place at all costs ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
asian	i 've been sick ever since . vomiting , diarrhea , chills , fever .... definitely food poisoning of some kind . if you decide to go here make sure everything is cooked all the way through .
asian	we were the only ones in here . the teriyaki chicken was like rubber and grisly . i couldn 't eat one bite . it was disgusting . the tempura was ok but it 's hard to screw that up . i have been here a few times and no one ever seems to be happy to be working here . the place needs a make over . the seats are cracking so they are uncomfortable on your legs . it 's dirty . we have given this place too many chances . i paid my bill , didn 't complain and left . we will not be back .
asian	24 hours later when i reviewed the photo i took , i saw a freaking fly in my soup . it 's probably in my stomach now .
asian	husband and i eat there at least once a month . since it has been opened the place has become very rundown , dirty and in need of a good overhaul . the food is good to very good , but eating in this atmosphere makes it feel just plain nasty . i have told the manager about our concerns and he seemed surprised . until there is a face-lift we won 't be back .
asian	was thoroughly disappointed with the food . for the price , the portions were very small . the cut rolls were mostly rice and the sticky rice with spicy tuna was too greasy . ( the tuna was good though ) . the worst part was that the waitress tried to shame us into ordering more food . i understand the upsell but she was trying to make us feel bad . we saw right through and couldn 't wait to get out of there .
asian	tried the sister store in mesa today . thinking they changed owners this was not same quality of food we had before ! chicken patay oily and peanut sauce a blob . won ton soup old and tasted like canned chicken soup , spicy seafood should have been called spicy veggie for lack of clams , mussels and shrimp . only good dish was chow mien chicken with special papaya sauce . the server didn 't get our drink order right but after asking twice for 2 diet cokes and hot tea we got 1 of each ! it was not busy 2 other tables besides ours and food came out fast ! thus1 rating i wish we just passed this one up !
asian	the food was generally well prepared but the bao were terrible and everything was cold even though they were quite busy . the staff were even colder than the food ; i felt like i was on an assembly line being passed from person to person . won 't go back .
asian	ate at the buffet with my family. only giving one star since i can 't give zero or negative. fish in the sushi was not anywhere near fresh and made my sister so sick she threw up. all of the meat products were raw in the middle causing me and my stepdad to get sick. it was the worst food i 've ever had in my life. everyone that ate here got sick. even the watermelon was horrible. i don 't know how they fucked shit up that bad but they did .
asian	ate at this place last night ... miso soup was good .... vegi noodle dish in beef broth was horrible .... this place is way over priced ... i will not go back again .
asian	first sushi place that the shrimp was not cleaned out . soooooooo grosssss ! service was really slow and they weren 't very busy . really disappointed and most def not going back .
asian	so , we decided to do it again the next saturday and were told the buffet ended at 7 : 45 . the sign says they have it both sat and sun dut no stopping time . ask to talk to manager and he was very rude . he stated that it is his decision when to close and we should order off regular menu that costs the same but with less food . i really liked this place but we will not be back .
asian	service consistently rude and absent . last time i walked in , i walked right out . it was like i walked into a triad meeting , no music , just the quiet whirring of the overhead fan ... more like a crime hideout in a warehouse than a restaurant . very dirty .
asian	nothing tasted homemade or authentic . tastes like americanized filipino food . my moms tastes way better . the lumpia was even disgusting and the chicken adobo wasn 't appetizing at all . idk how this place has so many good reviews because if you are a true filipino , you know dang well that this place doesn 't taste good at all .
asian	this time was not good . service was slow . first dish was a seafood pad thai . it was mostly noddles , with very little seafood . the second dish , which came 20 minutes later was seafood pain fried noodles . the noodles were burnt . again , there was very little in the way of actual seafood and mostly noodles . the mushrooms were also almost raw .
asian	the last time i ate here i had a dish i was used to and after a few bites , i broke out in a rash . they advertise no msg , but my reaction proved otherwise . very stingy when i asked for my money back . to be fair , i was at work and wouldn 't get there in time to get my money , but i was scolded about not saying i was allergic to msg . .. didn 't know i was supposed to if there is a no msg note on the menu . really uncool . won 't be back .
asian	they have a great selection but service and wait times were well below average given there were only a few other tables of 2 present during dinner . the two stars are for their variety and flavor . a few of their special rolls were delicious but almost every item was poorly constructed . it almost seemed like sushi rice wasn 't used . all rolls and nigiri fell apart as soon as they were lifted off the plate . i know that all new businesses go through their growing pains so i 'm hoping quality will be addressed . i may try them out again in a few months with hopes of improvement
asian	have waited a couple times to see if it 's actually fairly consistent . it is . consistently bad . bottom line is this ... good for airport food , bad for sushi . rolls are soggy , as is the tempura . rice is nearly suffocating - like peanut butter around the roll . found a small rock / pebble in my roll today . not kidding . again - probably decent for airport food , just don 't expect much .
asian	the food was not good at all . i didn 't like any thing i ate . it was all cold and had no taste . on top of it all my boyfriend and i have been sick all day today . never going back here again . it seemed great at first , but the service continuously gets worse , the quality of the food is getting worse , and now the last two times we are here we both spend the next day sick .
asian	i don 't know what happened since our last visit here but it was awful this time and we won 't be going back ! too bad we will just have to find another sushi spot when we visit vegas .
asian	service was terrible unless you are korean then you get served right away even though you came in after us . ayy goo racism ?
asian	it was pretty gross . no clue if it even exists anymore . moving on ...
asian	i have tried several chinese restaurants and buffets that are good in phoenix , but this was just awful . i will never go back to this one after it made me sick like that .
asian	food tastes okay , but definitely not worth it .
asian	read the bad reviews . knew it was not going to be that great . decided to go again because i wanted to try something different . got this chinese fish dish that was just absolutely horrible . fish fillet floating in grease with absolutely no taste . i could make something better at home . avoid at all cost . why go here when there are much better restaurants around . on another note , apparently they have hotpots there now ? maybe i 'll stop by there again just for the hot pot even though i 'll probably end up regretting it , again .
asian	also , they have been leaving flyers on my door lately , so i 'll definitely never be doing business with you guys again .
asian	decent selection of food and usually many unfilled tables / booths , so feel free to choose wherever you want to sit . food isn 't all that great , but for around $ 7 , you don 't have much to lose , other than the possibility of getting sick . stuffed crab and ribs were my favorite . the inside is very dark and dull looking . also somewhat gloomy .
asian	they are open till 2a.m. i showed up at 1 : 40a.m. and they said they were closed and wouldn 't serve us . i pointed to the sign that said open till 2a.m. and she just walked away and left us standing there !
asian	the food had so much sauce on it i could not eat it i had the lettuce wraps i would not order again . also was expensive for something i could not eat
asian	we thought we 'd give this place a chance again ... we were directed to the opposite side of the room away from any servers and we 're were waiting for about 30minutes counting without being noticed . i feel embarrassed and about to leave . thank you yelp for allowing a place to share this experience .
asian	i had the shrimp mojo . in my opinion if was very average and salty . couldnt eat all the shrimp which i have never done ! my business partner had the 20 vegetable fried rice . he said it was ok , but there were very few veggies and in some instances only one veggie of a particular kind . the seats were incredibly uncomfortable . i would not recommend this place .
asian	i was so disappointed cuz i 'm crazy about pho. this was one of the worst i ever had. would never eat here again . i can make a better pho at home .
asian	i had realized my table was near the bathrooms and there was a very obvious sewage problem going on in there . i had lost my appetite and will never go back again .
asian	egg roll and squid awesome ordered the pad kea mow at a 3 but came at a 8 easy too hot called the owner over and tried to explain and he started to yell at me grabbed my plate and in front of a crowd to me to get the f out of there . i will go to the corner thai kitchen at trop . and tee pee .
asian	my wife 's parents owned a chinese take out restaurant so speaking from that perspective . this place is just ok . nothing special and over priced . i ordered extra protein ( sumo protein ) and did not appear i got much more . also there was a plastic twisty in my food . they were apologetic and gave me a $ 10 gift certificate but won 't be back .
asian	general tso chicken was grizzle . kung po chicken was greasy and very little chicken - what was there dark meat . chicken lo mein oily and smoky not much chicken there either . no fried rice available another review said great food like ny ? ? ? no way - lived in ny for 49 years . this stuff was awful and not on the same planet as food from ny . i do not suggest eating here - i know my family and i will never go back
asian	food was average along with the service . spotted a roach running around in the dining area . needless to say we will not be returning
asian	i 'd give 2.5 stars if i could , the spring rolls were very nice and stuffed with shrimp . however , the order of chicken i had was completely dried out -- it was seriously like eating chalk . the flavor was ok , i guess , but the meat was so overcooked it was impossible to really tell .
asian	it was super slow and took about 45 mins to get my food . all i ordered was a lunch entre , the thai fried rice i mean it tasted good but service was bad due to how long it took . on top of that , it seems like the air conditioning was broken because it was really hot in there . not sure how a restaurant operates like this considering how hot it is here in az . i don 't think the food was worth the wait nor dealing with the temperature .
asian	egg drop soup was watery and bland and the general tso 's was over breaded and very dry . even the egg rolls weren 't good . the only redeeming dish was the crab angel which had a nice amount of filling . we won 't be back .
asian	was pleasantly surprised . food was fantastic and probably some of the best sushi i 've ever had - and all for a great price . ------ update : june 1 2016 i 've decided to downgrade my review from 4 to 2 stars . since the new owners took over , the quality has gone a bit downhill . they appear to be trying really hard , but it 's not there yet . instead , i 've now switched to mine sushi down the road .
asian	food here is over priced like it was before and i would say the food is so so . my party and i had rice combo plates and spring rolls . the rice plate were really run of the mill avg , nothing special . the sauce for the spring rolls was really loose , no way near a true dipping sauce for a spring roll . i wouldnt come back here at all ... just based on the food . our bill for 3 entrées , 3 desserts , and 2 appetizers endeding being close to $ 55
asian	everything tasted like bad fish , threw it all in the garbage . beware
asian	i have been vomiting and having the runs all day ! i was very dehydrated with body aches . felt like the flu , but worse . i don 't recommend this place for sushi .... it will have you in the hospital = /
asian	i should have noticed most of the bad reviews are in july , seems like its getting worse .fish was not fresh rice was bad . most of the staff just seems confused .
asian	possible food poisoning from the salmon rolls . didn 't taste good , and was skeptical at the time of eating it . i should have taken a clue when the owner was also serving and making the sushi . dishes pilled high in the hand wash station . the kitchen looked dirty . avoid .
asian	me and 4 others ate here and towards paying our bill , one of my friends noticed a b grade hanging up near the kitchen as well as a c grade near the entrance door . if we noticed this before eating we wouldn 't have eaten here . this is my 2nd time eating at this place and never seen a grade for a restaurant with a b. or either both a c. if you plan on eating here , i would think twice . this restaurant needs to update their grade . will not eat here again until this issue is resolved
asian	selection of food was pretty good , though nothing tasted amazing . now for the bad news : my poor fiance got such terrible food poisoning he hasn 't been able to get out of bed today except to stumble to the bathroom to throw up . needless to say we won 't be going back , and i strongly caution anyone considering going !
asian	won 't go back . smelled fishy when we walked in and i assumed it was the seafood on the buffet ... as we left i realized the smell was the fish tanks that looked far overdue for a cleaning . the walls on the booths were dirty with food and grease as were the siracha and soy sauce bottles on the tables . all desserts i tried were dried out as though they had been on the buffet all day . the rest of the food was average . i tried the sushi and regretted it immediately . i was thankful i didn 't get sick . you would be better off going to panda express .
asian	my son had the orange chicken and i had the lemongrass chicken . we both ended the night with upset stomachs and painful trips to the bathroom . we both had sweet and sour soup which was funky tasting as well as the crispy bean appitizer . our server was nice ( her first day of training ) but the service was so slow . we were there two hours . they also did not clear the table after each new meal delivery . i can 't return to this place
asian	both of us got food poisoning . i would recommend anyone to stay away from this place .
asian	the food came out very quickly ... maybe too quickly you know what i mean ? it 's a funny thing when it comes to quick service .... there 's a fine line between an efficient waiter and feeling like they 're trying to rush you out the door and get their tip . unfortunately it felt like the latter . the meal was affordable and decent however nothing outstanding .
asian	very sketchy . food hygiene seems a bit weird , ie crab legs leaking onto the desserts . i would not go here if you have any severe allergies . also we were initially seated right beside a cart full of dirty dishes , which was pretty gross , and annoying when the servers would come and dump their plates . fortunately they moved us to another table at our request . definitely not worth the prices they were charging for a lunch buffet .
asian	was the most sick i have ever been in my life . had not eaten anything that day so absoltely positive this was the cause as was she . called and spoke with manager who told me to come in for refund . went in and was told by owner she would not give me refund unless i had hospital report . she was rude and they completely did not care about my wellbeing or making this right . do not go . disgusting .
asian	the sushi & sashimi is quite good , but the service is terrible . we were greeted by a yawning hostess , had 3 different servers over the course of an hour , had to ask for parts of our meal , and were made to feel that it was an imposition to serve us . in this economy , restaurants are fighting to keep a customer base . pure is not .
asian	we ordered the sushi and sashimi combos which were okay , nothing special and not the freshest . spicy salmon rolls were not good at all . they give you free salad , miso soup , and jap chae which was too oily . wouldn 't come again unfortunately .
asian	got turned off cause when my wife took a bite there was a piece of metal in her soup . they brushed it off like it always happens not coming back here ever
asian	pad thai spring rolls the pad thai was the most unusual pad thai i 've ever had , in that it really didn 't taste like pad thai at all , was too dark looking ( too much soy ? ) and was basically crap . the spring rolls were a little better , but not better than the nearby vietnamese place . so i do not recommend this place at all . if you want good thai ( for madison ) go to thai noodles on mckee . adios !
asian	got the veggie maki option which was made in front of us , but small . also got the general tso 's made with tofu , which was acceptable . still longing for a place that makes vegetarian tvp dishes . if you have to eat it , i 'd reccommend take out though , as the place is so crowded with random stuff you wouldn 't want to find a restaurant , you feel like you 're sitting in a pack rats living room .
asian	fish quality is just okay . i ordered my food to go bc i was waiting for my friend at the salon next door . when i got my food ... everything has deep fingertip imprints on it . and the fish fell apart off my rolls . the whole having fingerprints on my food grosses me out man .
asian	definitely do not recommend the all you can eat deal , it is not worth the money . on top of that they had horrible customer service , mediocre food and a laundry list of rules and regulations for their all you can eat special . they also don 't follow yelp rules by enticing customers to leave 5 star reviews and get a free dessert . so they definitely have a bias yelp profile !
asian	threw up 2 hours later . i 've traveled all over south-east asia and latin america . when traveling i 've gotten sick about twice .
asian	overpriced , and execution was sloppy all the way around - each dish was clumsier than the next ( oily and soggy , unbalanced or uninspiring flavor ) . oh well , maybe i caught them on a bad day , but next time i will go somewhere else .
asian	granted , i do not need to eat a lot of food , but i thought the portion sizes were too small . much better chinese restaurants in the immediate area . maybe on a second visit my experience would be better .
asian	it was awesome ! the next time , we ordered 2 different meals to go . we paid for them then came home and opened the bag only to find out that they competely messed up out order . they got our soups right and one of our sides , but our 2 entrees and the other side were wrong . decided to try those meals because i didn 't want to drive back to chef chiangs , and both of them were pretty gross . love the mongolian beef there but i don 't know if i 'll ever risk ordering it again only to get the wrong meal .
asian	pei wei used to be great . i had one of their new noodle salads and was so disappointed. there were about 4 noodles in the bottom of the bowl and the rest was lettuce. my friend had shrimp fried rice and that was disappointing as well. only about 4 shrimp. don 't think i will be going back any time soon .
asian	went to the bathroom after . washed my hands and a live cockroach was in the sink . reported to public health .
asian	was always one of our top choices for korean bbq , but now toward the bottom of our list . first time we have been here where restaurant was empty . and now i know why .
asian	gross ! ordered the lite plate of their meat and 2 which means that it is less food . however , price is the same for lite or regular plate . the food was subpar , and i won 't be returning . so disappointed !
asian	ordered one of their lunch specials which is green curry beef with rice at $ 10.45 tax included . the curry was runny , bland and has small servings . i can eat at new thai family restaurant a few blocks beside sobeys at a lesser price and still have a satisfying experience . the only saving grace is the quiet environment and not sure if that 's helpful for a restaurant business and my polite server which i forgot the name .
asian	it was terrible . the food tasted good but the service and portions were way off . they had to replace both our orders and the portions were small and the vegetables were super skimpy for shawarmas . all in all super dissapointing first and last impression . the server tried to tell is that we ordered wrong and that she personally saw the cook put the vegetables that were clearly not in the wraps . definitely wouldn 't go back . maybe other locations are better but this was terrible value . could have had pitaland for half the price and bigger portions .
asian	we told the waitress and she just looked at the counter and walked away . i am super grossed out and i won 't be back. ever .
asian	we ordered the 4 course dinner for 2 and waited forever for our server to even take our order . then after the apps came , the dinner entrées took 45 minutes to come out after the apps ! ! ! our server never came around between the apps and the main course . i used to come here all the time and not sure if we 're going to return .
asian	rice dishes are pretty good but stay away from everything else , including the namesake : pho .
asian	once in restaurant and once ordered online . the food is terribly meh . do not get the " oodles of noodles , " its terribly oily and lacks zip . the spring rolls i ordered were also not fried to golden brown , there were a sickly beige undercooked colour . overall , waaay too expensive for what you get .
asian	thought i 'd try the new vegas buffet . while , it is clean , the food was terrible . my 4 year old didn 't even like the rice , and he loves rice . maybe i had a bad experience and i 'm willing to try them again when it 's a bit more busy .
asian	i am sad to say that i was highly disappointed . i was looking forward to this place ! we had dinner here on a friday night . the service was okay . the food was bland and just plain terrible . the fish tasted anything but fresh . the soup was sour like rotten milk , and i almost threw up after eating . needless to say i don 't think it was authentic shanghainese food . my husband was looking forward to the soup dumplings and even those were below par . i should have known better because there was only two other parties in the restaurant when we got there . never again ! sorry not sorry .
asian	the service was awful . even though the restaurant was empty , the waitress only came to our table once after taking our order to refill our drinks . the chef who made our food obviously wanted to be anywhere but there . the food tasted good but the portions were really small . i had the chicken & shrimp , which was $ 4 more than the chicken , and received only 4 shrimp . my family joked the rest of the day i paid $ 1 per shrimp . we will not be going back , too many better options in las vegas .
asian	total bill was about $ 100 which included $ 12 automatic 15 % gratuity cause our bill was over $ 80 ? ? ? common food and nothing special , place was quiet on a friday night . not coming back as it was bad value .
asian	the server was attentive and explained the dished very well , and i might return . i had the basil steak and the rest of the group said their meals were good , but not great . for a restaurant in the aria , this one fell short of expectations in comparison to other thai restaurants .
asian	the selection wasn 't great at all . seems like they only had 4 different carts of dim sum and we were being offered the same thing over and over again .
asian	we are thai food enthusiasts . all i can say is : don 't bother !
asian	it 's now $ 18.40 to eat the ever shrinking all you can eat menu . the service is slow and not attentive . the quality of the sushi is passable . i am now officially over this resto chain . i understand that this place will last because of all the offices along decarie - captive audience . their others probably will die because the quality to price ratio has gone way down .
asian	i have had authentic chinese and fast food chinese . this was neither . it was just incredibly greasy , poorly prepared food . the only dish that was decent was the pork fried rice . pretty tough to really mess this up but surprised they didn 't ! food served quickly . then service disappeared . strange place . never again .
asian	the food was okay but the service was absolutely horrible . one person in our group waited an hour for her smoothie even with asking about it 3 times . they messed up many of the orders , were rather rude about their mistakes , and customers who came in and ordered after us were served before us . never again will i waste my time at this restaurant .
asian	ate here yesterday .. food was average for a chinese place nothing special but all of us got diarrhea .. someone had written about mice running around 20 days ago .. should have taken the hint .. first and last visit ever ! ! ! !
asian	the food however ... my friend ordered the bun bo hue , myself and another friend got the 88 special . i asked for meat on the side ( which is normal and means the raw beef on the side ) , but instead got all the meat including tripe on the side . that was fine , but my friend 's bun bo hue had a hair in it and they promptly had to apologize and replace it . the meals themselves were bland and seemed to be teeming with m.s.g. we finished our meals and now realize that we all had bowel problems the next day . what the f % $ # !
asian	said i wouldn 't come for dine in ever again . fast forward a couple weeks .... i decided to try carry out with slices . i was told they are pre made slices and should be ready in 2 minutes . 20 minutes later .... i 'm still waiting . what the heck is going on with this place ?
asian	i defined have co e across other small places that the chicken had a good appearance and the shrimp was larger for around the same price . tried this place out - trying to find a good chinese restaurant close to home . will need to cont to looking .
asian	over priced , and just blah . again , i 'm sorry i 'm white , but my money is just as good as the chinese guy next to me right ? !
asian	the music was too loud - i couldn 't hear the person across from me . had the lobster egg roll - it was ok . nice and crunchy but the flavor was meh ... had the meat that you cook on the hot rock ..... did it once , won 't do it again . had the spicy tuna roll - the rice was too wet had the hamachi negi roll - rice was too wet will only come here for the drinks next time .
asian	the food is expensive , but not enough food . brought chicken green curry and there were no chicken . the same with the salmon . last time i ate at this place for lunch , i got super sick . i still trying to feel better but my stomach and my belly hurts no stop . not sure what was in that food that made me so sick . i will never go back there again .
asian	ate late on a sunday night and the place was packed. sexy lighting and decor and it was buzzing. great service. the food was pretty lame. i had the sea bass because i 've been overdosing on steak lately. it wasn 't cooked properly in the middle. also got some apps for the table : ribs weren 't very tender , the green beans were okay ; the edamame was okay. my friends got the kobe " signature " dish , which was underwhelming at best .
asian	walked in and three employees standing at the counter they just stared at us like they never seen customers . finally one of them gave us menus . the beef curry i ordered was the worst i have ever had . i 've traveled extensively in asia so i know what it should taste like . it was very salty . we had to ask for napkins , chopsticks , as the server didn 't give us any . also ordered wings omg so salty couldn 't eat them . i don 't understand how this place can stay in business there were no customers and seven employees working . my advice is ur craving chinese food go elsewhere fast .
asian	hibachi hicken was rubbery and had gristle , beef was not tender . sushi rolls seem to be the best option here . portions were adequate , service was good . not likely to go back , there are other places that are much better .
asian	worst food i 've ever eaten . lean cusino in freezer section is superior .
asian	all of our portions were undersized and overpriced . the food itself was not spectacular . two of us ordered the curry and i ordered the pad thai . service was unenthusiastic , classic rock blared over the speakers and throw rugs were worn and nasty . will not return . too many better choices in town .
asian	very disappointed when i got my bao like it came straight out of the fridge . the veggies were flavourless and they did not have cilantro .. a key ingredient . the banh mi was not toasted and was also cold . the meat was not seasoned well and the pickled veggies lack a lot of flavour . i expected a lot more taro fries at $ 5 and it really wasn 't that good either . prices are also higher than bmb .
asian	for one , the food is just terrible . there were 8 of us , ordering different food , and none of it was very good . i had the pork bone soup , which was watery and very skimpy on the meat . also , there was no potato and no rice . i was told that the korean bbq ( full serve ) was also very disappointing . my friend had a bowl of seafood noodles and found " 3 pieces of seafood larger than a dime . " the service was slow and seemed to be exasperated by all our orders . a terrible experience all around . no wonder no one else reviewed this place .
asian	thanks to her cuz will never come back no more to spend my money in this rude server thai restaurant.i spent too much money and the lady is so rude . she 's not supposedly in this kind of business cuz all she got is her mad face all the time . we 're not spending money juz to be treated bad . i hope the management can do something about this it 's ruining the image of this good restaurant
asian	the food has absolutely no flavor , the soy sauce made my white rice black , not the usual brown color soy sauce makes . got beef and broccoli , chow mein and some other stuff with mushrooms . never again .
asian	the spring rolls were fresh although i recommend the no chicken option . the wonton soup was great with a tasty broth . definitely recommend . the pad thai chicken smelled funny and wasn 't good nor was it a 7 hotness . not spicy at all , in fact . i won 't be back because the pad thai chicken was not good . service very nice but very slow . not many people were in the restaurant at the time and it was snowy outside .
asian	very disappointed . the chicken was over cooked and dry . beef dish was cooked in an unknown sauce with too much onions . a seafood casserole dish did not contain much seafood at all . the only passable dish was the snow pea pod vegetables . came with visiting friends from foreign . will not return or recommend .
asian	nothing but f-this f-that , * igga * igga that . gonna * uck you til you walk sideways . not what i would call restaurant music or environment . no wonder it was almost empty at dinner time . no respect for customers . can 't imagine many kids go there . unbelievable . worst ramen experience yet .
asian	it was typical buffet food . wasn 't very hot & food was bland . was very expensive for the quality of good .
asian	began vomiting 5 hours after eating there last night . had to miss work and still feel awful .
asian	salty and not much flavour . pad thai tasted like sweet and sour noodles . i 've been to thailand , and i 've tried many thai restaurants in vancouver . bangkok is really just mass-produced salty greasy north american " thai " fast food .
asian	food was veggie dish . the dish was almost 60 % onions . told server and her only response was sorry . told he manager on the way out . he said sorry . nothing off the bill but told me to let him know next time we came in and he would take care of an item . no thanks . won 't be back . if you are looking for japanese try the south point casino .
asian	last time i ever eat sushi there ( fish was half frozen anyway ew ) . i am so sick . : ( at least my boyfriend enjoyed his burger .
asian	around 1am ish , me and my little 6 yrs old boy has food poisoning from that place . we 're at the umc urgent care right now . hope that help . i 've also filed a complaint with the health department .
asian	the only other thing i had yesterday was a fruit salad so i 'm 100 % sure it was this restaurant . i ate the chasu pork , potato wrapped shrimp , tuna nigiri , salmon nigiri and a cucumber salad . not cool guys , step it up .
asian	the restaurant was very crowded and the wait was more than 15 minutes after you left your bowl at the grill to be cooked . the food in the buffet line looked old . the broccoli was not florets but rather tiny , tiny pieces . the green beans looked like they were out of a can and the quality of everything was average at best . two of us for dinner , one time through and 2 ice teas for $ 28 seems a bit much for fast food . if we are looking for mongolian bbq we will stick with yc 's .
asian	there was about 4 choices . food was cold and very gross . i 'll never go back to this place .
asian	i was very disappointed in the quality of the food . i ordered noodles , and teriyaki chicken . there was only 4 small pieces of chicken , and the food overall was cold .
asian	waiter sneezed into his hand and then wiped his hand on his apron . i refused to accept the serving plate that he then brought out and asked him to wash his hands and bring new plates . after the meal i complained to the manager . the manager said that the waiter had told him about my asking him to wash his hands after sneezing and that he never sneezed . the manager then told me " to get over it . " i will never go back even though i had been going there for over 10 years .
asian	i ordered the large beef stew , it was delicious , but had only one little piece of meat the size of a quarter and the rest was potatoes . i finished my meal , pissed , looking at my roommate eating his big portion of chicken . you guys suck !
asian	the place was pretty expensive and just not very good . generic food court food .
asian	will not repeat . cheap prices , but also verrry cheap quality food . many better quality food options in the area for the same price-point .
asian	there were plenty of food options , but the food was horrendous . one of the worst chinese buffets we 've been to . even the kids were turned off .
asian	young man went to sit us and the owner came over to tell us the table is not available . after a while a table opened up and he sat a group of people behind us . i asked him what happened and he said no one told him we were waiting when he was the one to tell us to wait . we left as he threw his hands up in the air . i bet it 's good food but don 't go there unless your a regular . lots of tables opened but reserved .
asian	waited a long time for crab leg . over an hour they were tiny for a 16 dollars buffet good variety but all tasted mediocre lots of dirty plates . told the girl at the fruit bar , and she came out with a towel to clean it right at the buffet table . donno why she did not take it back to the washing machine . i took a pic too great wall taste better and shan hai too
asian	we both shared a bowl of saimen with bbq pork in it . after we ate it we both started to get an itchy feeling in the back of our throat and i started to get bumps on my lips . we are both allergic to shellfish . my sister then asked if they put any shrimp in the broth , they said yes . aloha kitchen you can kill people who are allergic to shellfish and other seafood , you need to place warning on your menu !
asian	therefore the music and the mood were killed . we did not enjoy the food . after spending most of the night with stomach pains due to the sushi will never go there or recommend people going there .
asian	the sea weed salad & rainbow roll were both delicious . then , i ordered the fried calamari ... it tasted like rubber with a very slimy texture . wasn 't separated at all just one big ball of tempura . the salmon roll was warm . there was a bug crawling around my friends roll and they still charged us for everything . cool art on the walls but i refuse to return .
asian	but most of the food was cold , not lukewarm , but cold . you expect that buffet food isn 't going to be piping hot all the time , but this was ridiculous . upon telling our waitress , she offered a bunch of excuses . she took 2.57 off our bill as a discount for us mentioning the cold food . we ordered hot tea , flavorless . she had brought a teapot , but only one cup . we asked for another cup to use and were charged an extra dollar for that . bathroom walls are disgustingly dirty ... bloody boogers and all . sushi was just ok . overall , very disappointed and will not be back .
asian	once we sat down after waiting 20 mins after being told 2 minutes we ordered our drinks but was missing a coke . we reminded 3 waiters for this . waited 1 / 2 hr before receiving it . cooked food came quickly still waiting on sushi . service is not the greatest . waitress is very abrupt . food was not bad - nothing memorable or impressive no debit is available only cash or credit at this location . atm at front door .
asian	they keep changing their hours and have completely removed their breakfast menu . for the most part their food is really good but the place itself is so unreliable . they used to advertise a dinner menu too and now they 're only open 10am to 3pm ... make a decision and stick to it so you 're customers don 't walk over there only to have to find somewhere else to eat ! furthermore , they could really stand to lower their prices . in comparison to panda express , cupz , and mypie , nocawich food is on the expensive side . at this point there 's not a lot keeping me eating there anymore .
asian	at first i really liked this place but then they changed their chicken and it 's not very good now .. the past 3 times i 've been there i had throw my meal away .
asian	at first i really liked this place , its pretty inexpensive i once bought 8 people dinner and drinks and was pleasntly surprised how cheap my bill was , but after eating yokoso its game over for saga. compared to other places their sushi is subpar and their hibachi is just loaded with soy sauce .
asian	but after further reflection , and after burping fried chicken burps for about 4 hours after eating , i 've decided that big in japan isn 't worth the trip at all . the food court seating is somewhat lame as well .
asian	the first time they no showed i had ordered online , after an hour i called and spoke with a women who had no idea what i was talking about. they still never sent it. the second time i decided to order by phone to make sure there wasnt just an internet ordering system error. i spoke with one of the younger people who speaks english quite well. he assured me the food would be delivered with in half an hour. after more than an hour it never showed and i didnt think calling would solve anything this time either , so i didnt bother. waste of time and disappointing .
asian	the food came quite quickly to our delight . the actual service was below mediocre and the food tasted like dog food . my boyfriend and i ordered two plates he got the teriyaki and i got the kung pao which contained raw peanuts thrown on top of thinly sliced overcooked meat covered in some mysterious sauce that tasted like a dogs gravy . i informed the man that i didn 't like the dish and his response was a scowl and then he walked away ...... still charged us even though i only took two bites from the whole plate . i will never be coming back .
asian	i ordred the sweet and sour pork and chow mein ... where i 'm from chow mein implies noodles . delicious noodles . not the case here . what i did get was everything but the noodles . it was ok . the pork was okay but the peppers and onions were under cooked and there were marchiano cherries in there ... why ? and the pineapple was tasteless ... so was the eggroll . maybe i 'm just used to the amazing asian fare in california but the food from this place just made we want to fly home .
asian	i am being adventurous and eating out of my comfort zone . i ordered the hot and sour soup and the dinner lo mein combo . the soup didn 't taste right , it was peppery and sweet . the lo mein dish is okay , nothing special . the restaurant is nestled in a shady area and inside of the restaurant is small . overall , the food is okay .
asian	tandoori 's dishes have a lot of " fillers " so the meats we got in our order were very minimal compare to the other indian restaurants . the flavor is more americanized than i thought so it didn 't hit the " authentic mark " in my opinion . service is horrible , but i didn 't have much expectation on this field so it 's pretty much the food that i have issues with . it 's fun to try this restaurant once if you are running out of option , but i personally wouldn 't go back again .
asian	" we asked how many people for the gratuity and she said 5 , but we had 4 and a toddler . another lady ( better speaking english one ) came over and said they charge 10 % because holiday on a " sunday . " 10 % is not much money , but they tried to find any other excuse to charge extra . good one , san woo .
asian	one time ordered extra chicken and veggies and that 's when i got sick . i 'm not sure what it was but i couldn 't eat it again when i ordered the chicken didn 't even look cooked . what a shame because we needed this in our neighbourhood .
asian	we were seated and no one came over for at least 10 minutes . we flagged down another waitress who said she 'd tell our server to come over . we waited for another 5 minutes and she didn 't apologize and didn 't address the issue at all . the food wasn 't as good as it was before and they meat offerings changed and we more limited .
asian	we would mention the problem and made to feel like we didn 't know what we were talking about . when the last order had more fat than meat and again the management seem not interested in replacing our order with one with meat , we have never been back and never will go there again .
asian	they serve big portions for a low price . looks fairly neat and big when walked in . however , the food is tasteless , i never walked out a restaurant before with food left on table and hungry still . food needs big improvement . such disappointment . not returning .
asian	understaffed with many dirty tables , no rice roll material to make spring rolls and short supply of noodles in the soup and i reluctantly give it two stars . drive just down the street to pho annie instead .
asian	the servers are nice . food took forever to come . food presentation was beautiful . as for taste , it was good . but not $ 400 good . i 've had better at one tenth of the price . every dish was extremely sweet and loaded with sugar . the dessert tasted like sugar mixed with concrete .
asian	how anyone would dare to eat raw fish here has never heard of all the nasty worms dwelling in raw fish gone bad . the open kitchen looked too dirty and not refrigerated enough to go raw so i tried one of the veggie roll - nothing special . but honestly the smell of oil was so intense it just completely turned me off eating . i had to wash my cloth and hair twice to get rid of the smell - would not go back .
asian	however , and similar to folks sitting near us , server unfortunately forgot to bring ginger , etc . , and then took an extended time to finally bring it .
asian	i had read the reviews , and i thought everyone is just so picky about their sushi . but seriously . dont eat here . thankfully w saved a family from missouri that had walked in about 20min after us . it taste good when it 's in your mouth but after , not so much . great customer service but horrible food .
asian	no service . i had lots of questions and nobody to answer them . it might be better after 5pm .
asian	we only get 1 / 3 of what we ordered and we did not order lot at all . the food though not bad but compared with the price we paid and the waiting time , i guess we can find many other better restaurants than this place with the same price . very poor service , the ordered items never arrived . i personal feel it is a rip off restaurant as they use the waiting time to be an excuse to the customers for not getting food and we finally have to leave as our patience reached the limit .
asian	we ordered 3 out of 4 apps . very small portions the stew beef with peanut sauce 4 chunks of beef for $ 16 and it doesn 't come with rice . rice is extra $ 2 pork sisig for $ 15 was more like and appetizer size . overall not really worth the money .
asian	i didn 't expect the taste to be anything " authentic " but it didn 't even taste good in an americanized way . presentation was quite poor as well and portion size was below average . not worth it for the price you 're paying .
asian	bun bo hue : worst bun bo ever . the soup was beyond bland , presentation was horrible , and the veggies that came with it were all wilted . 2 . bun thit nuong , cha gio : so everyone was raving about their spring rolls and i had to try . this was also a disappointment ! spring rolls were filled with beans instead of actual meat . their grilled pork was rock hard . couldn 't get through either meals overall : definitely won 't be bad .
asian	bbl tea was average . nothing to rave about . food is terrible here . i had a curry dish with rice which was soggy and bland . my wife had a noodle dish which was the same .
asian	the food is a definite hard pass . i 'm a pretty big fan of sushi , and , for the price , there are at least three other sushi bars in town that will both taste better and be a better value . the service was attentive , but overbearing . i felt very rushed on a very lazy afternoon . don 't order any cocktails . stick with beer . you can 't screw up beer .
asian	atmosphere is like i 'm at a mexican / chinese / jamaican restaurant ..... cuisine could be better .
asian	food was not that great . servings were too small , though the bowls were sizeable . add-ons , expensive . i got the curry . it had lots and lots of rice sadly , little else . noodles looked okay . but not too interested in a second trip .
asian	the food is good but can get better at tomo a half mile north ... and a lot less expensive !
asian	food on the other hand was unfortunately not my favourite . we ordered from the hakka side of the menu . it was nothing amazing . pretty plain and lacked the classic hakka flavour . i will probably give it another chance and order some non-hakka items .
asian	had a bimbimbap and a soon tofu soup however neither of them worth the money we spent . food is a bit over priced , the soup was watery , bimbimbap had the smallest portion i have ever seen in my life . waitress was quite nice . not going back again . taste : 3.5 / 5 atmosphere : 3.5 / 5 average cost : $ 17
asian	food came really fast which is great , but it 's a pity that the food was too salty . most likely won 't return .
asian	food is good i like how they don 't use msg , the pho broth seems more clear than other places i 've been to . it 's about $ 5.00 for a small vegetarian pho soup and $ 2.00 extra for two meat add ons . i wouldn 't get the calamari as it was $ 8.50 and the portion was extremely small , and was only mediocre . i also ordered vermicelli which was really good . overall it was ok . update / next morning : my brother who ordered the rice dish with egg and chicken had an uncomfortable stomach this morning maybe the chicken was undercooked ? ? ?
asian	they do not stings on sauces , all pots come with plain broth , and from there you make your own soup base and sauce at the counter . there 's a choice between beef ayce and seafood . most if their ingredients are decent , out of 3 plates of beef we got 1 bad one . does not come with drink , pitchers are 3.99 overall : debatable if i 'll be back , if anything it 's because it 's so cheap .
asian	overall : probably wont be back , ill rather go to kinton down the road .
asian	pad thai lunch set - creme soup : adequate , few pieces of corn - pad thai : 1 / 5 , entirely ketchup based , i couldn 't even get through a quarter of the meal , barely any meats or veggies . overall : probably wont be back , nothing memorable .
asian	bun bo hue : way too much fish sauce , not a lot of meet , veggies were in fresh 2 . banh cuon : flour roll was unfresh overall : won 't be back .
asian	food : 1 . pork and spring roll vermicelli : delicious ! exceeded my expectations , being vietnamese i am a bit picky on viet food. but this was great . 2 . beef / chicken spring roll rice : this on the other hand was not that great . the beef was so tough , and dry . chicken was super super thinly slice . the entire dish together felt really strange . ive never had a spring roll with my rice dish before .. overall : probably be back if im looking for something quick .
asian	cheese spaghetti bolognese : 2 / 5 , nothing special , sauce wasn 't that flavourful 2 . hai nam chicken : 2 / 5 , the rice was a bit too moisted , chicken had lots of fat price : 6.00-8.00 for lunch special , included soup and a drink overall : nothing really stood out , prices were cheap , burned myself a few times with the hot spaghetti plate
asian	cheese spaghetti bolognese : 2 / 5 , nothing special , sauce wasn 't that flavourful 2 . hai nam chicken : 2 / 5 , the rice was a bit too moisted , chicken had lots of fat price : 6.00-8.00 for lunch special , included soup and a drink overall : nothing really stood out , prices were cheap , burned myself a few times with the hot spaghetti plate
asian	overall : probably won 't be back , there are way better asian food in the area
asian	restaurant itself is good , but have to go through elevators and the imperial palace atmosphere . : - / food : is decent . price : over priced . highlight : pa-jun is good warning : tips are included in your bill for party of six or more . first time being in a korean restaurant that does that . others : not a place i would take my guests to .
asian	atmosphere : typical chinese , pretty pack during lunch hours , located at time square food : beef brisket noodles : i didn 't particularly like the noodle used , and found the beef to be quite tough overall : won 't be back , there 's much better restaurants in the area
asian	chicken and vegetable noodle soup : the noodles were way over cooked , all choppy , same for the bok choy and chicken pieces . i would definitely not recommend this dish . 2 . beef brisket noodles : this dish was definitely much better . not the best i 've had but the broth was well flavourful and was given a good amount of beef brisket . overall : service wasn 't too spectacular either . but i 'll probably revisit , if in the area
asian	stewed beef stone pot- 2 / 5 disappointed , there wasn 't that many pieces of meat , the stew was overly sweet , and overly priced 2 . soft tofu soup : 2 / 5 portion was tiny , have had much better overall : probably be back to try other stuff , food wise , i would say its pretty mediocre .
asian	service : really bad . slow . waiters / waitresses will never check up on you . you can 't even flag them down . food : average . two of the three dishes i 've had here were really greasy . their bubble tea is probably the only thing i would ever have here . try out if you really want to . but as for service and food . not recommended .
asian	i wanted to like it but it didn 't taste very fresh ! more like packaged lunch meat and salad . soup was cold and it felt like i was in a cafeteria .
asian	had to ask for water twice . had to hunt down a server to get our check .
asian	the area was very crowded and left little room to move around or feel comfortable enough to relax . sushi was pretty decent , probably would be good for a to-go stop .
asian	servers and greeters were nice . i had ordered the tsuke-men and it was full of oil and super salty which would have been fine if it was rich in a flavourful way ... but it was just salty ... i generally love hanjuku tamago ( soft boil egg ) but this one was too salty as well ! in retrospect , i probably should have said something just to see if it was an accident or if it was how its suppose to be ... had to drink a lot of water after to hydrate myself ...
asian	at my visit , first thing to get my attention is the bright lighting , feels clean. the decor feels a bit chinese theme yet contemporary. the tea pot and cup are cute.but the food are pretty normal and even worst than average.end up 108 + tax for a guy and two lady which is super pricey for this kind of food quality .
asian	he served our filet mignon to the person next to us , then realized his mistake and instead of making more steak , reaches onto the strangers plate that she had been eating from and took back the steak and served it to my girlfriend . embarrassing . will probably not dine here again . one star for yummy yummy sauce .
asian	i ordered lunch special bbq short ribs for $ 12.99 --- all i got was 2 pcs of short ribs ! the picture on the menu was deceiving . bad service too ; will take forever when you call a server to come to your table . i will definitely not come back here ! ! !
asian	first of all the chicken was burnt and was room temperature . second the cheese rangoon was burnt so we asked if they can make a new plate of cheese rangoon then the cheese rangoon after being cooked it was frozen then we had lomein the lomein was cold and not good . they said since they are slow , not a lot of customers , that 's why it was cold . what a poor excuse ! ! !
asian	don 't expect much and take-out or request delivery . food is savoury , salty or extremely sweet and tangy . it 's a pretty depressing place . i sat there for an hour once and had some pretty depressing thoughts . i blame the setting . i 'm being serious . excellent choice on those days when you 're broke and really don 't want to eat at home .
asian	they harvest rice grains and make noodles per order . they also slaughter the cow in the back kitchen so that you get the freshest beef with your pho . at least that 's what i tell myself to justify this place taking 45 minutes to serve noodles in premade broth . i 've never seen a restaurant where 85 % of the people are not eating anything . if waiting a long amount of time for something that should be served in 10 minutes after you order is your thing then pho kihn do is for you ! oh and about the food ... it isn 't even that good . place is dirty too . never again ....
asian	swung by this joint for a saturday lunch , the place was packed , with a schmeezly one server for + 10 tables . questionable spring rolls with peanut sauce uncomfortably light brown and milky .. luke warm broth in my bowl of pho ( should be piping ! ) ... and flagging down the server to order , to get water , to get a check , to get back a check was not cool at all . yes , i may be critical because of my southern california descent , but i know it doesn 't take a rocket scientist to make a decent spring roll or hire more servers when clearly needed . x-nay !
asian	complete apathy of service , almost borderline rude . food was sub par , my usual favorite dish of matar paneer was almost inedible i threw most of it away . i would mention pricing but honestly if the food was good i wouldn 't be too upset but $ 20 + for a terrible meal isn 't good value . change your attitudes and your chefs .
asian	when this place opened it looked like a place that would serve authentic hyderabadi dishes at a reasonable price . the quality of the food steadily came down to a point where their food tastes very stale and has zero flavor . looks like the owners of this place threw in the towel and are pretty much out to get whatever they can before they eventually shut down this place . the attitude of the people that work at this place isn 't very helpful either when it comes to addressing customer complaints about the quality of the food that 's served . won 't be going back to this place ever .
asian	avoid ... unless you want to get insulted ! ! we were staying on the royal mile for a week and had some great food but our whole trip was soured by one lunch visit to this restaurant and very low level of service . the manager / owner was rather rude .
asian	had dinner recently for 10 people . the captain did such a poor job of recommending dishes that we did not have sufficient food . all he wanted to do was to make sure that enough expensive dishes were ordered like the $ 80 steam fish.will not be back .
asian	save your money and go somewhere else . went here for the start of a bachelorette party . we were seated downstairs in the basement at one of the hibachi tables . it was hot and no air was circulating . the heat continued through our 3 and 1 \ 2 hour meal . that alone should tell you how slow the service is . by the time i received my shrimp and scallop hibachi , i was ready to get the hell out of there , and so was the rest of the party .
asian	seriously the worst . bad attitudes , grim faces . the food is good if you can get someone to serve you . no welcome . no greeting . no thank you . they make you feel like a burden . deserve zero stars but the food is good enough if you 're desperate and patient
asian	be wary food goers , the english and chinese menu do not align . you may have ordered cucumbers with parsley , but receive a plate of onions . do not stumble into this pitfall as i did . service cannot process english well , so enjoy your plate of onions . food is below the standard of similar cuisines in the surrounding area . and at a higher price point . the interiors look and feel like a kidnappers ransom note . hideous . 1 / 5 would not order a plate of onions again .
asian	the food is good , but check your bill . i noticed a huge discrepancy on my bill and brought it to their attention . they adjusted it , but it was still incorrect , but still in their favor of course . it is my opinion that the error was not accidental . my eleven year old niece can add better .
asian	the service was slow , disorganized and inattentive . we ordered sushi as an appetizer which arrived after our soup and salad . the sushi was far below average - don 't even touch the yellowtail . as we waited for our appetizers our wine came even slower and apparently sharing a glass of water is a thing . the other people at the table all received their cooked appetizers before the meal . the teppanyaki chef was dull and rushing to get through our table . sadly he wasn 't in such a hurry as to cook our filet mignon rare as ordered . in short nothing went well . the food was bland , poorly prepared and presented .
asian	i order the rib tip dinner and was truly excited , until i took a bit . the tips tastes like they had been reheated a couple of times .
asian	this place is a pass . $ 6.35 for pho , $ 7.29 for a large bowl . the noodle wasn 't good , the broth was ok , and the place was uninspired . go to another pho place .
asian	unsuccessful . eggs were rubbery , fruit was old , and everything else was greasy and unappetizing . i hear ti has since changed ownership , so maybe it 's better now .
asian	they had a buy 2 rolls get 1 free sushi special . there was only 1 person preparing the sushi and 1 server for the whole place . our server took our order , brought our drinks , soup and salad and never came back . we ordered the sushi special along with a shrimp & chicken dinner . we waited 30 minutes for our food and finally got up to leave . the manager apologized but did nothing to encourage us to come back . we went to yama down the road where we received excellent service and delicious food . will not go back to tsunami .
asian	tried to get take out after that and they said they " didn 't offer " takeout . will not be going back .
asian	horrible service or just awfully mismanaged ! waited 10 + minutes to be seated , wasn 't ever even greeted ( even speak some basic thai ) . we watched them setup a table for 2 , our party was 3 . at that point we walked .. not sure any of us will return .
asian	attempted to have dinner here tonight -- place empty at 530 pm -- hostess -- reservations ? no -- sorry nothing avail -- no aloha sprit in my opinion -- took my business elsewhere -- and we 're nv locals -- maybe i need a gold card to feel the aloha ? -- nice decor - maybe 1 / 2 a star
asian	walked in , waited at the hostess stand for several minutes without being acknowledged . decided it was probably an indication of the poor service to come and went down the street to pei wei ! if the restaurant had been busy i would have been more patient , but after poking my head into the dining areas i only saw a few tables of patrons .
asian	the door was unlocked and the sign on the door says they close at 3 : 00pm . will not be coming back here since they do not want the business .
asian	i guess they didn 't need my money even though my order would have been to go . i will never attempt to dine here again .
asian	poor customer service from restaurant and server . no response still a week later from the restaurant . terrible .
asian	great bao was one of the competitors . the staff at the truck were friendly . the pork belly bao we got to sample had good flavor , loved the soft bun and crushed peanuts on the pork was a pleasant surprise , but the pork was half fat , and the fat was slimy , white and cold , we all pulled the fat off and ate it without . i 've had pork belly before and it was nothing like that . they ended up losing the smackdown , i wasn 't surprised .
asian	do not come here to eat. it 's terrible dirty and the foods are suck. the plate and cups they use are all plastic and dirty. the foods even worst. the services of course are worst , no service but charge tips on the bill without telling you. we only have 2 adults and 2 kids but they charged tips on the bill. really need to report them to city. the restroom , omg ... smell and dirty , worst than public restroom. so you can imagine how 's worst this restaurant is ...
asian	attention everyone , scam they said only $ 17.99 on sunday but when i came there it 's $ 20.99 , scam scam , false advertised ordered dynamite sushi roll , it came with no avocado , replaced with cucumber inside , when i asked the server , he said " the pics on the tablet was only for reference " false advertised , scam eveything advertised there was only for reference baddd service i rather come to sushi 168 instead , better server better food do not come there to eat
asian	the customer service is disgusting . they never smile to customers . i made to go order , the lady who took my order is very rude . never come again .
asian	this place will include tip in your bill and will not mention it , customers then leave a tip on tip big scam ! ! ! they did it to me a few times they got me the first 3 times on my 4th , i came prepared and asked for my detailed bill just as i was paying. he started justifying the extra " divers " lines in the bill saying these were tips included
asian	we sat at the bar upstairs which served a few items from the downstairs menu . the momofuku ramen noodle bowl left a lot to be desired unfortunately . broth wasn 't great and there was not a lot of noodles in the soup . the pork belly bun was very good . i got the ginger scallion noodles which had no broth , only cucumber , mushrooms and green onion . would not go back again .
asian	nice atmosphere . unfortunately i wasn 't impressed with the food . the salty pepper pork chops were not as crispy as i would like them to be and the flavoring a were all toppings not cooking into the batter . the seafood sizzling soup was awful . no flavor in the soup . no sizzle in the block of rice the put in before it actually got to the table . there was mushy fish and a few tiny tiny shrimp with no flavor either . i thought i would try it because it had good ratings but maybe what i ordered wasn 't the favorites of my fellow yelpers .
asian	if it 's an empty restaurant at night then yknow there 's something wrong with it ..........
asian	what i wanted had a 5 minute wait . what i ordered took 10 . i think any time food is fried , it should say it in the description . i don 't like fried food . got kung pow chicken , which is fried , but the menu description doesn 't say that . so salty it 's almost inedible . the snap peas are good - all 8 of them . the menu does indicate this is spicy , but it 's not at all . hey , pei wei - people who don 't like spicy won 't be ordering this . people that do will , so live by your little chili indicator .
asian	however , i really love their sushi boat conveyor belt , it is very cool and don 't see it often in toronto .
asian	for some reason they are staying open during a renovation , and it is extremely noisy . the choices on the buffet are slim pickings and at this time you are better served to take your business elsewhere . i wish them luck and i 'm sure after the renovation all will be swell .
asian	the sushi is overpriced and not very good . we had a $ 62 chefs sushi . the tuna was fishy and the shrimp mushy . the dim sum dumplings are excellent . we had the white shrimp and the heart of palm . excellent sake selection . note the sizes of the bottles when comparing prices as they vary from 300 ml to 750 ml .
asian	take that sticker down . with no reviews , i took a chance . expecting an asian fusion menu , the menu is similar to one you 'd find at china a go go . i ordered the orange chicken lunch special , which came with rice ( white or fried ) and soup ( egg drop or hot and sour ) . service was good . egg drop soup was solid , orange chicken was pretty bad , and the fried rice was mediocre . with so many other options in the area for quick americanized chinese food , this place doesn 't make the cut .
asian	at the entrance you have to prepay your food this cashier was telling us how much we have to pay but we did not understood it so we asked again but she ignored us and then she just pointed us sign !
asian	it wasn 't the case , my friend ordered the noddle and pork tonkatsu and what a let down it was . it was just a ramen pack served with an cold premade pork cutlet . also , i ordered their braise pork with rice . it was just taco bell meat serve with some mushy rice . in conclusion , the restaurant and the price seem inviting , don 't go to cafe unique 17. it 's a huge waste of money .
asian	ordered spring rolls and general tso chicken . spring rolls so greasy i sent them back after taking 2 bites . i told waiter they were greasy , but they remained on the bill . ordered my fave , general tso 's , which was composed of hard , deep fried " chunks " of chicken , and no broccoli . white rice was perfect . cursory , silent service . ample servings . beautiful space , too bad the food isn 't better .
asian	maybe it 's due to a language barrier , but the lady at the cash taking my take out order was not friendly at all . she was impatient with me prompting for my order ( even though i had already asked for 2 pork bone soup to go ) . obviously she didn 't understand what i had said . then i asked if i could choose the 1 side order that comes with the meal since dine- in customers get 6 dishes and the curt answer was " no , only kimchi . " food is charged at standard price , but the staff is enough reason not to go back !
asian	i suppose being spoiled with asian food while growing up in san francisco , i am totally biased . pei wei 's food is edible , just nothing compared to the asian cuisine you can get elsewhere ( even in chandler ) that is tastier and less expensive . for what this is , i would rather go to panda express .
asian	and this isn 't my first in counter either so be very much upset when they pull it off on you . quality of freshness on food is decent .
asian	at this place right now .. came in at 11pm .. food not out til midnight .. ppl that came after us had their food way before us .. when food came out everything was cold .. manager was ignorant , didn 't want to listen .. they took the food off the plate and refried it and put it on the same plate .. health code violations .. with the same cold ass rice ... manager still charges me for the food .. chilli oil and soy sauce on some tables going rancid ... like our table
asian	absolutely horrible . why are they so rude when they work for tips . this place used to be good back 4 years ago . they need new management with friendly staff . price is higher than other korean restaurants yet their service is very poor . i am not coming back here .
asian	waiter was not anxious to explain the menu . i do enjoy pho and this was truly just average.my wife ordered the pork and shrimp and it contained only two shrimp . they only take cash . i ordered a spring roll and the waiter told me that they were out of them . 10 minutes later i saw them serving it to someone else . i won 't be back .
asian	attitude sucks food don 't matter restaurant hours says closes at 9.30 and 8.30 they were closed once
asian	you will usually encounter flocks of church goers on weekends from across the street . i think its a convenient neat place to go to when you dont want to cook at home . if this is your first time trying filipino food , going for lumpia shanghai ( deep fried meat spring roll ) , okoy ( fried shrimp fritters ) is a no fail .
asian	i ordered under the fresh rolls : firecracker & rock n ' roll , they were good but nothing spectacular .. i then ordered an entree terriyaki salmon ( this was with the sushi rolls we ordered ) and let 's just say for abt 20 mins that entree plate never came out and in that same time frame the waitress never even bothered checking on us . not satisfied at all with the service . if you 're looking for a place with really good sushis , great food selection , and happy hour all day ( sushis ) check out oh yah sushi ( 49th ave / tbird ) . highly recommend the hawaiian sushi rolls !
asian	nothing special . what really bugged me was the service and attentiveness . it 's a small place and when i was there , there were 3 other occupied tables ..... you would expect quick attentive service especially with 2 waiters but no don 't fool yourself ... the service was mediocre with no attentiveness what so ever . for $ 19.99 per person i expected a bit better ............ oh well ..... live and learn .
asian	i had their beef noodles today which i would not order again . the beef is impossible to chew and swallow . msg and salt makes the food tasteful but be careful if you are allergic to the chemical .
asian	the food isn 't anything too special , it 's regular chinese food , although it is a step up from fast food places like panda express and pei wei . the service is not too attentive . it took us halfway through our meal until we got waters . the best thing on the menu ( in my opinion ) is the seafood crunchy noodles with a gravy-like sauce . sooooo good . this place is also known for their duck but i 'm not too much of a fan of it . i would not usually come here and probably won 't unless it 's for a friend or family member .
asian	brought my grandma here for dim sum on sunday . i don 't mind waiting cause it was expected but there 's no seats for the elderly when people are waiting . dim sum is norm for most older asians for breakfast brunch and lunch . the staff is quite rude also .. will consider other dimsum places since the wait is the same . update * * * * we waited for 45mins apparently they give seats to ppl they know . even though you got a number it means nothing .
asian	i 've eaten in the chain before and expect consistent results . sadly that 's not the case here . unfortunately along with the glacial service - they were badly understaffed , i ordered the kare lomen , which according to the menu is a coconut , chilli , and lemongrass soup , filled with ramen noodles and topped with cucumber , beansprouts and coriander . in this case the dish was most notable for the complete absence of lemongrass , cucumber , and the presence of one small sprig of coriander . a big disappointment .
asian	their $ 9.99 lunch buffet is great ! yes , it 's not as spicy as some people might expect , but the flavours are good , there is plenty of choices for vegetarians and carnivores ( and there is actually plenty of meat in the curries ) , the mango salad is delicious , and their rice pudding is amazing . the decor is a little tired , but the location is great , the waitress was friendly , food at the buffet replenished regularly . easy choice for a quick and delicious lunch .
asian	i used to always love lins but not anymore . hint ... maybe wear a hair net and hair pulled back .
asian	i had the chicken fried rice and that was ok . i probably won 't go back but only because the food was a bit far out for me . the service was good and the people were nice . a mix of cultures were in there eating . sorry for the poor score - just not my cup of tea .
asian	cow esophagus , cow tongues , gizzards , etc. are not usually found in american restaurants . whole fish comes with all the bones . you will need to be careful eating the fish . biggest complaint i have is the portion . one strand of small squid tentacle will cost a dollar ? all grilled goods are very small . i would say a person need to eat one hundred skewers to get full . fish is small too and expensive . i will not come here again because the value is no good . service is not so friendly either . decor is new and nice but the gigawatt tv screen is blinding and uncomfortable .
asian	the green curry chicken tastes funny . the pad thai was too sweet . the mixed veggies was too sweet . i still tastes sweet an hour later . there is just no way this is a 4 star ! ! ! i give 1 star for good service .
asian	good taste . service is ok , no smile , cold face . overall , 2 star is the most i could give . because dessert dishes have been overpriced , even doubled than market price . won 't go again .
asian	so authentic no one speaks english . the menu is translated very poorly , there are no descriptions of the type of beef or chicken or what ever it is you 're ordering . don 't expect them to have egg rolls or fried wantons . and whats more they don 't even carry chinese beer , they only have heineken . say what ? the waitress was very rude , but that 's expected . go somewhere else , go next door , its delicious and they help you with the menu .
asian	and of the main vietnamese restaurants , only the one on the left side of the main entrance shows promise . at least the bathrooms are acceptable , which is more than what can be said for lee lee 's or the chinese cultural center . hopefully mekong plaza will improve as more stalls open up in the food court hidden off on the north wing . until then , stick with lee lee 's .
asian	only ordered 4 entrees ( total $ 70 ) . i 'd like to have the option of gratuity for service especially when there is no service during take out . i probably would have left gratuity anyways during the payment process but auto adding for takeout on a relatively small order is just plain robbery and arrogance . the food is expensive for the portions to begin with . i will be avoiding this place simply due to principle .
asian	my family and i were lured in by the yelp reviews . fish didn 't taste fresh . it all tasted like something you would buy from the walmart sushi isle at their supermarket . i know walmart doesn 't sell sushi . but if they did they would sell yamas sushi . there are a lot of ayce places better than this . next time we 're in vegas . we are avoiding this restaurant .
asian	i called them asking if they had vegetarian food before i bought the groupon . they said yes. my sister order saki , and din 't even take a sip when we asked what we can have that was vegetarian. surprise ! no vegetarian broth or anything vegetarian . than i though i would give the groupon to a friend and decided to leave , the waitress asked me to pay for the saki , we never drank. i asked me to talk to the manager , she said she will be back with the manager , and returns 5 mins later saying no manager on duty .
asian	after reading multiple site reviews that showed it to be above-average , i gave it a try . the dumplings were rubbery and not very flavorful . the pork fried rice was okay . it was worth a try , but only one .
asian	although i cant say that i have had much success with chinese food in charlotte altogether either .
asian	my girlfriend and i have ordered take out numerous times . this last time we both ordered the sesame chicken dinner special with an egg roll . after about 8 hrs we both became violently ill . i have had diagnosed food poisoning before and this was it . my guess would be the egg rolls . again this was an isolated incident , but we will not be eating here again .
asian	hours were confusing as the first time i was there the hours said they should have been open but an hour into the day they were not open . found the selection average .
asian	i would almost suggest paying for a cab to get you off the strip and enjoy a more authentic asian experience . ambiance was fair . portion sizes were healthy but the chow fun noodles didn 't really tickle my fancy . lacked the flavor depth i was looking for in a restaurant in this price range .
asian	the sausage and pork katsu was dry . the food is made with no care . disappointing .
asian	been here twice , twice got chewy bulgogi that tasted old . grey and chewy and too sweet . sushi is terrible . avoid . if you want sushi , go elsewhere . like anywhere else . if you want korean bbq , go to cafe ga hyang . never again .
asian	i ordered the chef special butter chicken with white rice , the portions are small - a bowl of sauce with a few pieces of chicken . the flavours were very average , nothing to rave about . the most frustrating thing is that a $ 16 main dish does not even come with rice , and i only found out when i got the bill , they charged me $ 5 for rice . for a meal that costed $ 30 after tax and tips , i essentially had a bowl of sauce on white rice . simply despicable . never again .
asian	everything at wazuzu was frozen and thawed ... uni - they simply didn 't have it , nor mahi ... um guys it is vegas , and it is on your menu . if i remember correctly , this is the wynn , are we not at the pinnacle of indulgence yet ? hamachi - very bland and obviously frozen . ahi - just pitiful , guessing the steaks came from the local walmart frozen section . the final straw ... the salmon made me sick later that night , simply wasn 't good . beautiful setup , great service .... total crap food . do not waste your money or time .
asian	ordered spicy , not at all spicy , smokey maybe . not enough options . garlic ? anyway , enjoyed the saki and time with my family . won 't be back .
asian	not sure how a chinese restaurant could screw up chinese food , but these guys did . the lo-mein and kung pao seemed to have been cooked in the same sauce , both bland and lacking of any flavor and the lo mein was made with linguini noodles . based on this experience , i won 't be going back anytime soon .
asian	there 's nothing that really stood out , but i wasn 't expecting much from an asian restaurant located off the highway exit to one of cleveland 's inner-ring suburbs .
asian	this is thai fast food . ordered spicy basil rice noodles . the rice noodles were overlooked and there was not a lot of taste to the dish itself . the dish itself is titled " spicy basil " but it wasn 't spicy at all . i expected the dish to be at least a little bit spicy . if you are hungry the place will at least satisfy your hunger since the portions are big .
asian	average at best , very blend flavours everything tastes the same after the first bite , cash only .
asian	you 'd think that a restaurant called just thai would pride itself on attempting to maintain the integrity of classic thai cuisine . i was wrong . the restaurant itself is modern and pleasant , the staff friendly . the food , pretty bad . pad thai is something you don 't mess with . it seems that every item on the menu has been modified because they were low on ingredients and thought the customers wouldn 't notice . this place is only passable if you 're drunk and need sustenance .
asian	only decent for ayce . just like every other average ayce place , they will forget your order or even mix them up . we ordered beef and got squid tentacles instead ( we ate it out of shock still but hmm ) . also limited menu for lunch . sushi is not fresh , but will get you full nonetheless .
asian	chicken terriyki bento was 10 dollars . i would rather go to terriyki iii on flamingo then here . service was also non existent
asian	the place wasn 't very busy at the dinner hour on a friday night . the food taste overall was average and you have to bus your own beverages . i wouldn 't return . it was just ok and for the money you spend it should be a bit more upscale
asian	place can get pretty crowded quite often . long waiting times even for take-out orders .
asian	7 adults can eat sunday lunch for $ 55 includes tax and tip . the lunch was made up of 6 dishes and 5 pop or tea or coffee .
asian	is that would probably make it less than average . the food and tea is fine , but for the non-wow factor , the prices don 't match up . for this kind of pricing , go down the street to spring villa ! the inside , on a quick glance , looks like those fancified chinese banquets but this is an illusion . tinsel to everyone 's gold leaf . plastic to everyone 's crystal . if wanted fancified dimsum with average food , just go premiere ballroom or casa victoria ! if i 'm back again , it 'll be at the request of the family , not my own recommendation !
asian	we are at mizumi at wynn the night before , which was an amazing experience , so we had high expectations . the food and service were average at best . we did the family style omakase menu and was just not a pleasant experience .
asian	spring rolls boring and greasy , as was veggie chow mein boring . broccoli in oyster sauce was good and a good price
asian	the place has 3 floors . sometimes they turn this place into a club for events . the service is excellent , but the food is just alright .
asian	there was nothing hawaiian about it . i was hoping for some kind of pineapple but there wasn 't any
asian	lunch meal for both me and wife was bland . even spring roll was bland and small . not impressed at all . go across the street to bo lang for dim sum and flavorful food . i 'm not sure where the great reviews are coming from for this place ? maybe i was there on a bad day ?
asian	staff were okay . the food wasn 't so great , noodles are on the hard side and causes an upset stomach . cleanness level should be concerned .
asian	shrimp tempura came cold and food tasted bland . such a shame as this place used to be better . i won 't be back .
asian	sat outside on the patio which was nice . but you had to walk past the garbage and recycling to get out there . we ordered the tuna tartar which was delicious , served with yam tempura . the red dragon roll and the spicy roll was okay . they was soggy and overpowered with sauce . we had the fried banana and red bean ice cream which was good . the bill came to a little less than $ 50 . i had a groupon for this place , so that made it worth it .
asian	average food and bad services , most of the time , korean restaurant has some nicer service but this one is one of the worst .
asian	the only positive is that they deliver . when you call on the phone the people who answer make you feel like you are bothering them . not a friendly group . half the time they let the phone ring ring ring . skip this place and fun pizza somewhere else in peters
asian	kind of dirty and some flies going around . was ignored by two staff members when i walked up to ask a question . plastic cups , bowls , and chopsticks .
asian	probably won 't go back staff we 're not that friendly and messed up our bill . food mediocre at best . made me appreciate my regular thai restaurant so much more
asian	average food but nice decor great place to chill and have a drink but the food is not that great and it 's very $ $ $ $ i don 't mind paying more but the food quality must be higher as well .
asian	it 's a hit and miss with this restaurant . if you order to go , you will get scammed . me and my colleagues decided to order to go one time and when we opened the food up , we knew we had been scammed. it was 80 % potatoes and rice , 10 % meat and 10 % veggies . very unsatisfying that we had to find something else to eat . i would not recommend eating at the eaton center urban eatery branch to any one as there are much better authentic , honest middle eastern restaurants within the vicinity .
asian	crappy delivery time ... 1 hour and 15 minutes . not good -.- seems to be the standard around here . if your hungry from a hangover , order from here it 's also good for bigger parties . yum vodka and take out mix very well
asian	good delivery . bad side : we ordered the 3 choice combo plate with soup for 14.99 on their online menu ( see their website : http : / / maisonthai.ca / menu-en.pdf ) , and did not receive the soup . we called back and asked about the mistake . they simply said you need to ask for the soup . well , it says clearly on the menu the combo comes with it . not ordering here again .
asian	great ambiance and service . the dumplings were outstanding ! that 's about it . i had some type of curry noodle dish with thin rice noodles . it tasted just like pf changs - nothing special . i did order two orders of dumplings because they were so incredible . i would only come back for those .
asian	great concept and enjoyed my first visit . however , the only really good item is the red jade chicken .
asian	we were the only table in the restaurant at 8 : 15 - our server was rushing us out
asian	lack presentation , ingenuity , and tasty . taste like something i 've picked up from a grocery store .
asian	especially when you consider about its price ... none of the food here is either traditional chinese food nor good taste dishes ! do not come here ! ! ! you can find a lot of much better chinese food in chinatown !
asian	overly sweet curry and almost flavorless spring rolls fried in oil that tasted stale . not a good experience for sure .
asian	not worth wait . one time visit is enough for this place .
asian	i usually pay 50 % less at good restaurants . the waiter was really successful at upselling us appetizers for more than 60 $ alone , while sounding like it 's free . i usually trust waiters , but this incident reminded me to be careful next time . totally unprofessional .
asian	finally the food came - food was quite tasty but very greasy. and when we finished we have to ask for three different servers to get our bill . i 'm really not that impressed and will not come back in the future . for that price there are better chinese restaurants who serve better ( and healthier ) chinese food .
asian	our food order was incorrect ( and no apology whatsoever ) and when ask for something all you get is " it 's coming " but nothing came . also , try to avoid fried items . all you will see is batter without any meat inside .
asian	the only reason that i went there again is my son love one ( the only one ) item from their menu , for me " no , thank you ! "
asian	i personally don 't like over cooked duck skin , so i wanted to look at both pieces for a second time , the woman start to scold so loud even people at the supermarkets cashier could hear her . " you are a bad customer and i don 't want you . " will never go back to this place ever again . if you want to be treated with equal respect and freshly cooked food , then you are at the wrong place . found two hidden reviews describing the same thing .
asian	there were incidences where servers gave us looks for ordering food . there are better places to be for this price .
asian	" the price was pretty good as there are " afternoon tea " and " all day breakfast " specials . on average you can get away with eating here for under $ 10 . the service isn 't the best but the food is average and decent enough for me to come back perhaps for lunch or snacks . it is a place i 'd go to if i wanted to save money , it 's " cheap " on average .
asian	i don 't think i will be back anytime soon . many better options for $ 10-12 lunch
asian	don 't expect quality meat or good service . i understand it gets busy , but when you 're slammed and you 're just chillin in the front when we continuously ask for water it gets annoying . i 've been to many kbbq spots where they 're busy and still do their best to provide the best possible service . price is good for what you get , but like i said don 't expect great quality meat . just something cheap and filling .
asian	we ordered the kalbi , spicy octopus , and bi bim bap . the kalbi was good--well flavored and juicy , but i have never been to a restaurant where you had to pay extra for the lettuce , garlic , and bean paste to roll up the kalbi . the octopus was super tough , which i realized later , must have meant that it was frozen before preparation . the bi bim bap came without rice , which i had never seen , and barely covered the bottom of the bowl .
asian	nothing special about the flavours . overpriced too . go to tao , you 're much better off for the money !
asian	not bad but not great either . had a sushi craving and it 's a few minutes from my house so it was convenient . a bit pricey for the quality of food . i ordered to go over the phone and it took longer than they initially told me . i have been to several different sushi spots in charlotte and there are far more places you can get better sushi for the price you pay .
asian	had the pho ga and there was hardly any chicken in it . we dropped in and ordered take out and they were quite quick however i would not return as there is much better pho in the city . service is friendly however .
asian	had to add half a bottle of hoisin to generate any flavor . my beef was mostly gristle and there was no vietnamese mint which made me sad ! two stars but only because no sooner had i sat down , my meal arrived . if it were slow , 1 star .
asian	the soup wasn 't hot coming out of the kitchen which is my biggest gripe .
asian	a mix of japanese , thai , chinese and western food . no dessert ! ! big disappointment
asian	average quality of food , hostess cold has the north pole , service ok , prices dont make sense to what you get , it is a no , no , no ... but probably there is not much offer of japanese quality in vegas , except yellow tail which was much better when i went this summer
asian	the broth wasn 't as flavorful and i felt like they were super stingy on the meat and veggies . one plate of veggies for 12 bowls ? really . = [ the plate of meat had 5 pieces all about half of a baseball size of the thawed frozen cut meat . overall - there are plenty of other pho places that are better . skip this one .
asian	didn 't really enjoy my visit there ... i rather eat elsewhere for better quality food .
asian	the service was so terrible and the waitress was such a rude and belittling woman with awful english skills . the food is just your basic sushi that you can get at the deli counter in any supermarket . i suggest sushi hour for better food in a similar price point . ok not amazing .
asian	can 't pinpoint what , but something was missing from it . we had the philly roll and cali roll . def not the best i 've ever had . and the edamame had a weird smell / taste to it . like it had been either sitting around or over cooked . pretty sure i won 't be going back . oh , and they charge you a 5 % sushi tax . not sure what that for but i saw abut her reviewer mentioned it too .
asian	nothing to write home about but if you are hungry and in the area , its a decent meal . prices are mid to high for sushi . come in , eat , get out ...
asian	i sat at the sushi bar and the chef rarely look my way and it was slow , there was only one other person at the sushi bar ! the chef never asked what i wanted , i had to approach him . personally i will never go here again . food is average and the service is poor . with so many sushi places here in vegas i would recommend eating at another place .
asian	average sushi , mediocre service and poor house wine .
asian	ambience a nice change up . service , meh . took too long to get waters and drink order , but after that , service was okay . just felt like we sat a little too long from the initial seating til we got some attention from wait staff . i did like the hamachi popper , calamari and goyza ( potstickers ) . unagi sauce a little too sweet . don 't think i will go back unless we are dining with folks who want to go there . i prefer sekai in mesa or masa in gilbert .
asian	i got the spicy butter fish maki , spicy salmon maki , and sakura maki . it 's not a great sign when the best one on the plate is the plain old avocado , bonito , spicy sauce roll . i tend to dislike chopped fish in my maki , and that 's what this place offered . and it tasted too fatty / rubbery .
asian	average sushi , served quickly enough to feel like a fast food establishment with surly waiting staff and over-priced menu .
asian	average sushi very nice servers. this place has potential if only they hired a better chef. but what else can you expect ? i walked in with these expectations and i got exactly what i came for. do you honestly think you can expect better sushi with the kinds of businesses nearby ?
asian	it isn 't an inviting atmosphere and you can get so much more for the same or even less $ in terms of the sushi spots in az . if you do go here , pick sunday as that is their deal day .
asian	also badly managed service kept us at the table for too long . we had to wait for about 40 mins only to get our orders taken and served with water .
asian	definitely not worthy of a visit by samuel l jackson , or at least that 's what the management claims . hope you are a fan of the ketchup if you order the pad thai .
asian	granted , the ambience is better than your neighborhood thai restaurant but i can 't trade flavor for ambience . the service is earnest but save your pennies and head to bahn thai instead for the real deal .
asian	fish didn 't taste fresh and over cooked . they must have changed chef as food quality is not as good when it was pin kao . place is still nice and clean .
asian	one good thing , at least they have some sort of asian wait staff
asian	average thai food with very poor service.the attitude of the two waitress was extremely rude.have been to better thai restaurants and will not be back to this one .
asian	as best as we could tell , the kitchen was prioritizing making uber eats orders over the diners in the restaurant . no thai food , no matter how good , would have been worth that wait . spend your time and money elsewhere .
asian	staff was rushed and left me to call them over to get our check . waitress then looked at her tip with me sitting there . didn 't mind looking back at her while it seemed like she thought about asking for more . food is average szechwan fare . hot and sour soup is spicier and good , but missing the sour part . dumplings were good quality and didn 't skimp on meat . however , their sauces were bland . almond chicken is servicable ... just skip noticing that they use peanuts instead of almonds and that there is barely 3 oz of chicken . rice was a tad dry . meh ...
asian	typical buffet place . i over ate fried greasy food . the mongolian grill is hit or miss i 'm not a big fan of making your own meals as usually i get the flavors wrong . i go out to eat so someone else can cook me a good meal . dessert subpar-only good thing was chocolate fountain and fresh fruit . cakes and other desserts a disappointment for dessert junkie like myself service was good . prompt and friendly . clean dining area and bathroom
asian	i had the tasting menu and experienced some wonderful flavors . i was sick the next day , so not as keen after that .
asian	there are some standouts on the menu ( fried spicy calamari , duck and chicken lettuce wraps , some of the dumplings ) but most of what is on the menu is pretty weak and bad portion sizes . and the clientele is pretty terrible . i guess king west just isn 't my thing but if you go here any later than 8 o clock from thursday to saturday i wouldn 't bother eating here . more of the same tacky lounge crowd that domintes king west these days . if you want asian food then maybe actually venture out to one ( too bad all the good ones are in markham ) .
asian	apparently the menu changed to chinese cuisine . service was so poor , we decided to leave without even eating .
asian	the food was below average . sambhar was super sour and vadas were rock hard . price is also steep for the quality of food . silverware was dirty and when pointed this to the owner , he just ignored .
asian	every meat choice was either too sweet or too dry . the cabbage was not chopped , mac salad tasteless . i was going to share my concerns , but nobody was behind the counter . they were laughing in the kitchen . i do not think they were the owners i will not return or recommend .
asian	the food isn 't bad . i love pf changs , but for this amount of money , it 's better spent on one of the many unique restaurants in vegas
asian	i had a free coupon . it is similar to chipotle style when you order . i liked the food but more of a fast food vibe than authentic asian food . i like that it was on the healthier side . they serve complimentary miso soup but it was not very good and more bland .
asian	sadly the food was really bad . i may have ordered poorly , but mine was bland and luke warm . south asian food is my favourite , but this isn 't it .
asian	the place was an entire bar , with a gothic / rock vibe to it . food was okay , considering the fact we had to send back a plate because the noodles were so hard and had a nasty taste . save your money and go out to an actual restaurant .
asian	portions are small also . they were nearly out of everything . the staff from nathans was also running the cash register at pan asian . i assume they share ownership . would not recommend this place at all based on the quality , quantity and cost . you are better off spending your money elsewhere .
asian	seafood that only a portuguese peasant would like , seriously over cooked , charred on the grill and low cost selection of fish . the only thing edible were the shrimps which came as the finale . i guess there are folks who will eat cuttlefish , but they certainly didn 't show up friday night . only 3 tables occupied and the other 2 tables really interested in drinking , not serious seafood . they do have a regular menu , and according to the waitress we should concentrate on it .
asian	when i go to the frozen seafood and find most of the items are not fully frozen i have to wonder about freshness and food handling . saw a lot of what looked like older " fresh " fish too . cloudy eyes and dark brown gills . gonna take a hard pass on this place .
asian	disappointed that food looked prettty shabby . service was excellent ; it was the food that let me down . i saw some mussels , clams and one fish dish as far as seafood was concerned .
asian	unfortunately , i got the shitty service . i ordered delivery from them but the driver ever came . an hour after i ordered , i called to see if the driver was on his way , and of course i was promised the food was on the way already . another half hour passed by and the food still didn 't come . oh well , that 's what you get for buying chinese food sometimes .
asian	they take cash only . rude in manner , automatically stereotyped me for not being able to speak chinese when i spoke to them in english ; i 'm not from a chinese decent .
asian	based on the reviews here for the lunch buffet , i gave dinner a try . of many indian restaurants i 've tried throughout the world , this was at the bottom 10 % . so don 't expect much . ( and do not order the pakoras . the worst ! ) but , this being scottsdale , it seems that folks will settle for just about anything .
asian	not authentic . the service is slow . food is quite average . it 's lack of depth in flavor and really salty at the same time . everyone we observed eating there ordered the random asian dishes inspired from various east asian countries . it 's an expensive pf changs
asian	it tasted like they used sweet and sour sauce and are tryung to pass it off as pad thai . tasted one bite and did not want anymore ! the mi goreng was ok but nothing special . i don 't see how anyone can rate above 2 stars here .
asian	the noodles were over cooked as well . not our favorite .
asian	bad service , awful food . probably the worst in montreal . the waiters are not attentive , and don 't inform you if anything you ordered is unavailable . many items ordered did not arrive at all . the nigiri and maki were overfilled with too much rice and very little fish . cutting corners ?
asian	ordered fried rice and discovered that there 's was a piece of meat heavily deep fried with legs and a head . trying to determine if it was a fly ... looks like one . my brother went to the bathroom then came back and he couldn 't eat anything afterward . major upset stomach during the night for the family , also . cranky waiter and waitress , not happy to be there . hence , please avoid going here ! !
asian	the food was horrible from brownish not fresh salad down to dry hibachi chicken . and to top it off sushi was worse than local grocery store and double the price ( should have stop with sushi ) please learn from my mistake ! !
asian	nothing is fresh . they pre made their rolls and so the rice is really hard especially the spicy salmon roll . the shrimp tempura within the roll is soggy and you know it 's been pre made .
asian	pathetic service ..... least interested in serving . street food at chinatown will get u better attention , good food and less price . bill was 96 , i got credit card charge of 111 ...... customer review card that came with the bill was pre filled with all good options ........ will never repeat
asian	decided to sample the appetizers and boy was that a mistake . ordered vegetable & chicken egg rolls and they delivered all pork . the teriyaki beef was as tender as shoe leather and just as tasty . don 't get me started on the crab rangoon ! ! ! if you have no other options for places that will deliver i guess order from here but don 't expect to enjoy the experience .
asian	should be renamed ickybahn . the people who gave positive reviews have obviously never eaten good asian cuisine .
asian	terrible food , service and experience . i had dinner with 5 friends and we all agreed we would never go again . the food is not tasty and i highly doubt it was prepared on the spot . i regret having wasted time and money at la maison vip .
asian	ordered for pickup . sat in the restaurant for an hour waiting for a simple order . very slow . when order arrived i went home , opened it up , and found it incorrect . at this point all i wanted was to get a hero burger but the staff at the restaurant claimed they could not provide a refund - i had to talk to a non-present manager . i was able to get a refund for the missing item . i will never return to thai room .
asian	avoid at all costs , rude and horrible service food is mediocre at best , and it takes one hour to get to your table , and if you complain they pretty much tell you to shut up , avoid this place at all costs , do yourself a favour and drop by mcdonald 's or something at least you 'll still had your dignity .
asian	i did all you can eat and regretted it . their advertising said one price and they charged us more and then apologized but still charged us more. isn 't that illegal . they also charged us for our 2 year old that ate next to nothing . i 'll never come back here . at first they were hospitable but understaffed and totally rude when it came to the end of the meal . i can 't believe people are recommending this place. we all left disgusted
asian	the waitress that served us had the personality of a north korean prison guard . the overall service was the poorest i had ever experienced . the food was tasty , but took over 40 minutes to get to us .. we 're talking the soup took 40 min . it 's too bad , the food was fresh and did taste good , but the experience is part of the deal too .
asian	treated my wife so bad and the food is below 9 / 10 other quick chinese restaurants . stay away
asian	the service is slow and very laid back ! we had basic stuff like mixed vegetables which was bland !
asian	sushi chef is the waiter , busser , and chef . extremely small selection for the all you can eat . low quality . i thought the chef was cleaning the refrigerator but when he turned around he had a california roll on his plate . it tasted just okay . kind of on the plain side but what the hell was he doing in the fridge ?
asian	the perfect kitchen is far from perfect . these yelpers below me must not have had dim sum before . cheng fun is the worst i had . the skin is like plastic like grocery quality . fried squid is not fried but dipped in oil . cheng fun with donut fritter is not crispy and does not come with sesame sause . tried to cancel a dish but it still came out 15 mins later . we have much better dim sum places in mississauga . not cheap either .
asian	this hotpot place is horribly understaffed and undeserving of tips . they even force the service charge on the bill . they lost our order sheet and made us redo it .
asian	this place is only trying to rip you off ! i went with my family during the holiday season and all they had on there menu was $ 38.99 menu selection and nothing else . and what you get is plain steak and half of a lobster and disgusting salad . they had a santa claus there that night who was the saddest being ever lived . he never once smiled , even when taking the pictures with the customers . you can tell the owner does not treat there staff well and is only trying to squeeze every dollar out of everyone . avoid this place like the plague and do not go to there affiliated restaurants as well .
asian	food is good as are all pei wei 's . customer service and wait time are horrible .
asian	worst service ever . and the food , not good . sticky rice not cooked at all . soup , all broth with a few chunks of nasty meat ( i think it was meat ) .
asian	bought chicken and pork skewers on monday . husband and my father both got sick several hours after . both high fevers , vomitting , stomach pain , and diarrhea . took hubby to urgent care today , has not gotten better . asked lady that served if the meats were just made . should have took it as a red flag when she shrugged and took a moment to say yes . no long lines . it looked like skewers have been out for a long while and the way they stack it , not all of them would have maintained being heated through . ate at several filipino style buffets but never have heard getting anyone this ridiculously sick . never again .
asian	avoid . avoid . do not go here if you aren 't forced to by your boss with the threat of termination and without a package and ui . absolutely atrocious . they can 't seem to get anything right . sorry . correction . their soft drinks are fine .
asian	avoid ! avoid ! i just took two bites of the chicken teriyaki , and the rest is going in the trash . not even worth feeding to a stray animal . if i could leave zero stars i would !
asian	terrible service . the only good thing i 'll say is the owner didn 't need to be told it was time to give me my money back . skip this place and just go to the print shop in the atrium on bay or aden camera on yonge .
asian	there are about a hundred options in the area with better food , prices , and service . not sure if the servers at this place are in a competition to see who can treat customers the worst . like the poster below me , i would also give them a negative star if i could . yuck .
asian	these people seem to have a thing for bringing their kids into work , and one of the little bastards tried to drop kick me as i walked in the door . i should 've left then . the place was filthy ; they must have friends in high places that keep them from being shut down . i was in a big hurry because i was on a break from work , so i took a chance and ordered chicken lo mein . it was edible . the young guy working behind the counter was very polite , but that doesn 't make up for the filth , and the attempted drop kick . try springgarden or king fong instead .
asian	what is this place japanese ? italian ? do they know who they are ? we ordered seaweed salad - i think my frys has better salad for $ 2 ; my daughter ordered california rolls - very average ; the pad thai was as bland as i have ever had and the calamari was over fried and zero flavor - no wonder they offer sauce . kids liked the cinnamon flavored bread so that accounts for one star .
asian	heard terrible things about the drinks here so i decided to go for the food . ordered har gow , shumai , and lotus wrapped rice . it took twenty minutes : the hargow was fine , the shumai was still uncooked , and they ran out of the rice ( after i already paid for it by the way ) . take heed and get outta this place asap
asian	especially during lunch . the service is just terrible and i 'm quite certain they forgot my order because i just got soup and side salad to go and it cannot possibly take more than 30 mins to prepare that when i arrived earlier at 11 : 40am . the guy who was behind me got his food 20mins earlier and he did not preorder .
asian	expectedly poor service , super crowded , food is meh ( signature lobster dish is ok ) price is good but other chinese places around here provide about the same value and taste just as good . just because this place is new there are throngs of people . don 't be one of these stupid ppl . what 's the fuss about ? crap . i want my money & my limited 2 hours priority seating time back .
asian	i came here for summerlicious . the appetizer was nice . however , the main entree which i ordered was just simply a pan fried small cheap salmon filet dumped on a plate which i could make anytime by myself at home . the dessert was supposed to be a sake cheesecake but there was nothing special about the cheesecake . it looks like a cheesecake you buy at a cheap supermarket . i paid $ 36 for a meal that should have cost at most $ 15 . waste of money . the portions were soooo small that i went to mcdonald 's afterwards to fill me up . avoid this place .
asian	this place used to be better but now i 'm not feeling it that much .
asian	have ordered from this place twice , both orders have been over £ 40 , both times the delivery was 2 hours late and when we phoned to see what was happening to our order we where told the order was on its way which it really wasn 't if it 's still hasn 't arrived 40 minutes later , so unhappy with this place ! ! ! the communication between the staff is shocking you cant get a clear answer from them . i will never order from this restaurant again . also forgot parts of the order .
asian	their deal was lots of rice and paper thin sushi . stale rice and sashimi was left over bits just go to a real place not chinese joint masquerading .
asian	poor variety and the quality is not great . most food was cold / warm and not tasty at all
asian	if you ever see those white square plates at a korean bbq , it 's fake and owned by a chinese person . it 's not korean food at all . korean grill house franchises are all horrible with bad quality food and service ; the meats should not be watery with sauce or blood everywhere . it 's all quasi korean food and you are better off going to christie-korea town or north york at a smaller korean restaurant that will serve you fresh meats .
asian	had the spicy umami miso ramen and crispy chicken . both were horrible ! ramen was cold and tasteless . chicken was more like jerky . do not recommend eating here and i 'm very surprised by the positive reviews .
asian	i got duped with the chicken teriyaki that came with miso and salad . added shrimp tempura . salad was drizzled with ketchup ! ketchup ! miso soup did not have tofu in it ! barely any seaweed . teryaki was loaded with sugary sauce with next to no chicken ! the shrimp tempura was just deep fried with white flour batter . paid 30 $ with tax nd tip . avoid this place if you are looking to experience proper japanese cuisine ! i am just thankful for avoiding the sushi at this place !
asian	i was excited to try this place because i know a lot of people who like it , but it 's super expensive ( $ 14 for lunch combo of miso soup , 4 pieces of sushi , and a spicy tuna roll ) , and the sushi was not good / fresh at all . also , they don 't tell you that there is a $ 20 minimum card transaction until the very end . this is a modern restaurant in " downtown summerlin . " not even my chinatown places have a $ 20 card minimum ! ! ! luckily i have cash . very disappointing and stupid !
asian	i went here for the buffet recently . they hardly had any food and promised to refill . this lie is what made us agree to pay for the buffet . they bring out only a little bit of food at a time . there is tons of food in the back , and the whole restaurant was complaining about the lack of food especially the meat . yet only little bits would trickle out from their pre-made pile in the back . they let you fill up on rice and naan which is well stocked but have to compete with other patrons for the meat . you are better off going elsewhere . we left hungry and frustrated . it 's a trap and a ripoff .
asian	the food quality is continuously horrible . my food had mold on it . when i called and asked to speak to a manager no one spoke english . never again .
asian	i 'm not sure what their sanitary standards are like but i bought a milk tea and got sick to my stomach and so did my girlfriend . i 'm not sure if this is an isolated incident but it ruined my weekend at my vegas house .
asian	the last two times i went there i left after sitting at a table for 20 minutes with no food . sometimes a cart would go by - a different table . no amount of hand waving or imploring looks would do any good . you couldn 't drag me in there kicking and screaming on a weekday again .
asian	avoid ordering the ramen noodles here ... totally disappointed and not worth the money .
asian	overpriced , bland meals that fully take advantage of the area 's tourist draw . the pad thai was incredibly average and in one of the smallest portions i 've ever seen . service was slow and other patrons were served before we were . i paid $ 30 for two dishes ( no tip ) and i 'm no less hungry than i was before i arrived .
asian	had the hibachi sesame chicken , my husband had the hibachi steak . first course onion soup was super salty , tasted like it was hot water with beef ramen seasoning . salad was decent enough . veggies served first then meat . bland- nothing special . certainly not worth $ 50 . they also serve this nasty " shrimp sauce " which is basically thousand island dressing . i was worried about the food safety on the hibachi " chef 's " cart . kinda grimey-lookin . worst part was that later that night , both of us got sick from eating there . i 'm talking sick like from the movie bridesmaids . it was bad . spend your money elsewhere .
asian	the portions are sub standard . there 's no special flavor at all . the wait time to put an order in is long . they don 't tell you how to pay and you 'd be trapped at your table forever if you don 't scream out to get the attention of their super spaced out staff !
asian	the meat isn 't that fresh or appealing . the vegetables are decent and the fruits shiny , if you can get them . they have a weekly flyer with specials , but the specials really aren 't worth going for unless they are for prepackaged items . the fresh stuff goes in a snap and they don 't refill the bins . located in a corner plaza at shepard ave e and warden , there is plenty of parking in the shoddy parking lot .
asian	loud , randomly chosen music . chicken lettuce wraps - chicken burned , should use newer lettuce . need to pay more attention to food preparation and quality .
asian	i asked for sugar / condensed milk or any sweetener. she responded , no sorry. and said next customer ! zero sugar in it. beware. customer service horrendous .
asian	the noodles were bland and boiled , and not cooked together with the other ingredients so it was very underwhelming . there was nothing stir-fried about it , really ... at least the calamari was great . get the calamari .
asian	it 's really , really bad . driest i 've ever had , and i never understood my colleagues loving it so much . whenever i would come here for lunch i would stick to the panko fish or pork katsu , plus a mochi for dessert . the inari sushi is also good . their rice is fine , but the nickel and dining up-charge for brown rice or spicier food just makes them look cheap . note that it does get crowded during the lunch rush , and the better ( non-teriyaki chicken ) items take longer to cook .
asian	i was served frozen tilapia when i ordered tai . i know my sashimi ! 3 star michelin prices , for the price i get fresh wasabi and top grade shoyu in japan .
asian	what all the other reviews are saying is true ! ! ! they don 't deliver when they are supposed to but still charge you for a delivery you never received , then on hold for hours to try and correct their mistake , then refuse to give you a refund for their mistake ! ! ! ! ! avoid avoid avoid !
asian	had to wait 30 mins for them to actually make my order . they promised that i would get a free order next time i call in . called in and they said it wasn 't written down . owner lied to my face never going back to this location
asian	overpriced ! ! ! the food tasted like a sample . the waiter was rushing us to order and seemed bothered when we asked questions . again avoid this place
asian	apathetic staff acts like they 're doing you a favor . portions are very small , chicken is more gristle than meat , and the scallops tasted like burnt rubber . we threw out $ 30 of inedible food . complete fail .
asian	avoid this place as much as you can. we waited for almost 45min to an hour for our food and when we got it it 's pretty much cold .. and i 'm so mad to eat so i just end up just looking at the food and being disappointed .
asian	avoid this place at all cost , food is mediocre , service even worse
asian	normally i don 't post negative comments but do not waste your money or time at this establishment . terrible meat quality ; limited , blend side dishes . on top of that there 's a mandatory 15 % tip for parties of 5 or less which is unheard of .
asian	only need to say one word ... cockroach ! this place is disgusting . i want to give it no stars but you cant ... 4 of us were sitting there and i saw a roach crawl by and then my buddy saw a big one and smashed it on the glass that the fish sits under . gross ! if you want good sushi in vegas without the roaches go to sushi way . never had a bad experience there .
asian	awfully slow and rude service , vague and confusing pricing on their specials and regular menu , super underwhelming / bland food , weird decor , etc . the worst was that these shady people charged me a 15 % tip in the bill without saying anything , then when i paid with my card there was a space to leave your tip which i didn 't realize until i left the restaurant . they double dip with the tips and take advantage of people . scumbags .
asian	first of all , the parking is an absolute nightmare . not enough spaces . secondly , the hostess is tricky . she tells you that there is not much wait . then she makes you more than a half hour while letting in their regular customers in front of you . looks like you need to be a frequent customer to be respected . finally , the food wasn 't that great for having gone through all that aggravation . price was expensive too . it was a dim sum experience from hell . avoid like the plague !
asian	the cashier was all smiles until we showed him our groupon . his demenior then changed and he started to become very angry . he said that we should have shown him the groupon when we first entered the restaurant ( which makes zero sense ) . he then angrily told us that we had to purchase an additoinal food time . he randominaly charged me $ 6 . more importantly , the food was horrible . rude service and bad food ... you have been warned .
asian	the sashimi they serve us is one of the worst i ever tried . the place is not even clean . last time i went with my friends , we found out that the table was sticky . they didn 't even bother to clean it , so we end up cleaning the table . also the waitress was kinda rude . they kept forgetting our order . and it always took a long time for them to come to our table . we had to reorder stuffs that didn 't come to us .
asian	avoid this place at all cost , they don 't have customer service skills and when you need service it 's like a bother to them i would rather go to jennipoh or pho kim long .
asian	we had the worse shaw-long-bau with $ 3 each ( $ 12 for 4 ) . pros : - clean - nice set up - in the caesars palace - friendly staffs cons : - bad food ( not tasty at all ( below average ) - very pricy ( about 300 % than food in china town )
asian	called to place an order and the girl that answered made it seem as if i was inconveniencing her . i started the order by ordering pot stickers and was told that these are no longer sold at this store . that is all i needed to hear and called another place .
asian	extremely rude staff and entrees are $ 15 with no rice ! place to me is a rip off
asian	food tasted stale . i 'm guessing the toppings ( chicken , shrimp ) are simply defrosted and places on the noodles or rice . even the veggies tasted watery .
asian	gave it a try and it happened to be the worst dining experience i ever had . rice were overcooked and not edible . good idea but bad execution . we called back to voice our displeasure and the staff did nothing . we ended up throwing away most of the food . such a waste of money .
asian	the place looks great but everything else falls short . very expensive ( expected at an airport ) but service is absolutely horrible . their ipad ordering system requires you to pay ( and mandatory tip ! ) first . the staff is more interested in chatting with each other than in serving customers . we had to wipe down our own table . there are no refills on tiny and expensive drinks . the staff doesn 't come back to offer anything else even when paged with their ipad system . the chairs have low backs and aren 't comfortable at all .
asian	reasons to go : free wifi , big enough they won 't kick you out . looks are deceiving here- it 's clean and bright and big- but that 's about it .
asian	smelly place with below average food . wish there was a better asian restaurant within crocker place .
asian	their food isn 't good and their service is really bad . i ordered noodles with roasted pork . the noodles didn 't taste like anything and the pork was salty and cold . they also forgot some of our orders and when they arrived , they were also cold and bland as well . the servers were also rude . they spill your food all over the table and place your dish as far away from you as possible . you 'd be better off spending your money elsewhere .
asian	everything that we ordered looked so crappy ... never going back again
asian	i ended up rushing to urgent care for anaphylactic shock from cross contamination-assumably from shrimp which i am highly allergic to . my meal consisted of veggie tempura , avocado roll and cucumber roll . there should have been no reason for shrimp , shell fish or any kind of fish what so ever to end up in my meal .
asian	food was average and service was mediocre . the old asian host was seen rolling her eyes a few times at patrons which is extremely rude . i would not recommend this place . the service and quality of food has gone downhill from a few years ago . there are several other japanese restaurants in the surrounding area that has better service and food .
asian	i had food poisoning after i ate here . i ate nigiri and later fell sick to food poisoning ! food poisoning ! if you don 't know what that is , it 's continuous diarrhea . i had to visit my family doctor . avoid this place !
asian	i had severe food poising after eating at this buffet. warning stay away at all costs ! food was room temperature or slightly above , everything tasted two days old. projectile vomiting , diarrhea , shakes , shivers , fever. you name it. avoid spice market buffet ! if you are reading this take it serious , unless you want to have severe food poisoning on an airplane !
asian	i have eaten at buffets for a very long time . this place has to be the worst of the worst . i have eaten better food in a third world country in some of the worst conditions ..... and it was better then this . the food is dangerous ..... the health department is going to be paying them a visit . extreamly unsafe ! !
asian	this place is naaasty . egg rolls had no flavor and some bright pink stuff that was supposed to be meat . the water tasted of chlorine . there was a hair on my plate . general tso chicken had tendons in it . my wife threw up after we left . do not go to this place .
asian	it is authentic chinese trash . if you can avoid this place ( because you 're part of the las vegas tour group from an asian travel agency ) , go to the tgi friday across from it .
asian	avoid this place like the plague. how this place was voted best in vegas 2007 is besides me. the spice market managed to f up food i thought was fail proof. the beef tenderloin tasted like it was boiled in water. sushi , dry and hard. crab legs , salty and watery. i lost my appetite one plate in , which was one plate too much .
asian	they are so rude and condescending . the food is hit or miss , portions are tiny , and most tastes packaged or canned . the staff are so blatantly rude and they don 't treat you as a paying customer , more like they 're doing you some favour by serving your table . absolutely terrible , stay away unless you enjoy paying to be treated poorly .
asian	we order two orders of spring rolls that looked and tasted like they came from the frozen food section of walmart . not only were they awful they were still cold on the inside order bowl of won ton soup that the broth was boiling hot and tasteless . the won ton were over cooked and soggy only saving face is fresh set of customers daily . if this place was off strip it would be closed with food like this the hostess also had an attitude , seems not only she not care she was rude . the other customers sitting around us also were not happy with the food nor service
asian	only ate there because everywhere else was busy . noodles had no texture . doesn 't taste authentic . won 't rte .
asian	overpriced and tricky restrictions on " all u can eat . " be careful about the hidden fees ! even an eskimo can make better sushi than this " japanese " restaurant !
asian	sushi was badly made every roll fell apart . bad service very slow got our meal wrong twice . stick with the chinese menu if anything at all .
asian	the food was good , but it was the worst service i have had in the last twenty years . the food took 40 minutes to come out , and he brought out only one plate at a time . the waiter completely forgot one of the orders even after we repeatedly asked about it . he also forgot one of the drinks . at the end he tried to overcharge me on the check by more than ten dollars .
asian	it 's expensive and you don 't get the food quality for the price they want you to pay .. avoid it ..
asian	the meat is not fresh . the beef looks like it has been staying out for weeks with patches of dark spots already appearing on them . vegetables are dry and yellow . service is mediocre and slow . i would give this place a 2 stars but my gf insisted that it deserves a 1 . i 'm used to dirty ghetto hotpots but my gf does not share the same opinion . she wins .
asian	they are a scam ... they stick obnoxious flyers under the doors of hotels . when they get into trouble , they just change their name and number to something else .
asian	took nearly and hour and a half to get food ! the server said that is about standard since they only have 1 sushi chef ! hello its a friday night ! prices were high compared to other local places . quality of food was average at best . server was actually friendly and would do much better if she went somewhere else that had faster plate times . i suggest aki hana right up the road . much better .
asian	long service . super overpriced food , tiny portions and service is also very long .. you much better off the kiosks in front
asian	very slow and poor service attitude . we ordered a dish that turned out completely different than both the chinese and english description in the menu . we offered a gentle comment to them that they should be more clear with their menu description and i was very clear that we are not asking for a refund or credit or anything . yet the captain took it as great offense and gave us poor attitude for the rest of the lunch . service in general was also very slow . they just don 't have enough serving staff there .
asian	waited 30 min for a disgusting looking plate of " stir fry " that was not edible . sent it back because it was so grosssss ! two other people in the place and it took over 30minutes to get one order of disgusting food ... get it together people .
asian	we went the other day and it was nothing but a nightmare . when we just walked in the place was steaming hot . the food server wasn 't very good at all . first of all when we arrived at 6pm , they told us they ran out of chicken for the day . it was only a few options left because of their limited menu . beef , beef and more beef non seasoned and had no taste . couldn 't get refills on water ! ! couldn 't get white rice when asked several times . service was just bad , and the place wasn 't even that busy . definitely would never go back ! ! ! !
asian	although the restaurant is a 6-minute drive away the food took over an hour long . when i received the food , i call the restaurant because half of my order was missing . the woman who answered was annoyed and stated tje obvious " it 's in a separate bag . " then , silence ... i got annoyed and suggested she should call the driver . she just said ok , i had to ask her to take down my number . absolutely the worst customer service . food was cold and tasted terrible . this business should be shut down .
asian	this is probably the worst place you can go to if you expect any type of service . they have an all you can eat menu however they limit how many pieces of food you can order . for example you are only allowed one piece of lamb chop per order ( that 's two bites ) and can only order another one after you have finished eating it . also you should expect to wait 15 to 20 minutes between orders . they seem to do that purposely to make you waste your appetite . absolutely horrible experience ... tried it three times and it was consistently bad ... will never go there again .
asian	we just had dinner at this restaurant and the food isn 't spectacular or all that good to begin with . however the worse part was when we were leaving there was a cockroach crawling on the wall behind where we were sitting . so grossed out and will not be eating here again .
asian	went for dim sum and the front desk manager / waiter barely understood english . sat down after selecting dim sum and she tried to charge me for takeout before dim sum time expired ! the octopus tentacles were very rubbery ! like they fried plastic ! then she started jumping to the music beside my table ! unprofessional and illiterate woman . go to casa imperial or spring villa instead .
asian	went for dinner on a week day . staff barely speaks english and act confused . very poor communication between staff . waitress who took orders , was confused so the manager asked us and we confirmed , so the cook made something different . said we wouldn 't be charged for this and not original order ( which was -4 dollars ) obviously , why would i pay more ? anyway after 6 hours got food poisoning and puked it out . chef mixed the seafood and meat with the knife likely .
asian	we went because they accepted credit card and the menu pictures posted outside looked delicious . the food is bland and flavorless .
asian	we went there last night and it was terrible . everyone got sick and couldn 't stomach what we ate . the food was obviously left out for some time . in fact , we saw an employee scold another employee for putting out raw sushi that was bad . we will never return here again .
asian	we said no . she brought our drink and confirmed again whether we wanted to do all we can eat . we said no again and then she never showed up . we were staving , so i went to talk to the manager once and still nobody came to take our order . we were really pissed so we left . it is busy there , but they have time cleaning tables and letting more people in , just no time to serve people who don 't want all we can eat !
asian	a crunchy but skinny veggie egg roll with thick sweet and sour sauce is also party to the lunch special . i got the kung pau beef it was spicy and yummy fresh onions and green bell peppers that were good and not over cooked . the accompanying noodles were over cooked and turning into mush the fried rice was well just kind of bland and boring . the staff was very attentive . not bad in a pinch , but there are better fastfood chinese places .
asian	waited 20 minutes to get seated and then waited another forty for our food - which we received four sushi pieces and the waitress told us they were out of the other sushi we ordered . yet the table behind us was getting plenty of sushi delivered to them . the price was was to expensive for what we received and the staff didn 't even apoligize for not coming over sooner to let us know they were out of what we ordered . good thing the company i went with was great to pass the time
asian	another bad 1 hour check out . we even saw a roach cross the floor why we were waiting . why do i do this to myself and pay for this every time i come here ? 200 bucks a pop and this is the expectation . wow ! what a waste of money and time .
asian	not worth the 24.99 for the " all you can eat " ! they also charge you 10 % service fee for 2 people . i will never go there again !
asian	do not go here . totally overhyped and not good at all . we went here based on all of the reviews and were really disappointed . it 's not japanese food or sushi and it 's mostly korean , but their korean food sucks too . the bimbimbap we had was just fried rice . no vegetables and no meat . the japanese udon noodles are pasty and tasteless . the fried chicken with a side of mayo was also a big disappointment . if you enjoy asian food , please listen to me and do not go here . this is just a big gimmick . avoid .
asian	i ordered pad thai with hot and sour chicken and it tasted like ketchup on noodles . my girl ordered a papaya salad which came with shredded carrots on top instead of papaya . the lady at the counter insisted the carrots were papaya . ridiculous . the worst vietnamese restaurant experience i 've had in toronto . the food is cheap and even then you still don 't get what you paid for ...
asian	the worst vietnamese restaurant experience i 've had in toronto . the food is cheap and even then you still don 't get what you paid for ... i went in to eat for the first time for dinner . my friend and i were disapponted with the pho . we definitely will not be coming back . we don 't recomment this fast food place to any one .
asian	this is a korean owned japanese restaurant . worst spicy salmon roll i 've had . these were salmon rolls with a squirt of sweet kimchi tasting chilli sauce . it just tasted wrong . rice was cold . bulgogi was dry . salad was wilting . soup was watered down . there was only one other table here at dinner time . i will not come back here .
asian	i just waited for an hour to find out they had a glitch with their computer and never made my order even though the online order tracker said it was on its way ... never again ! ! !
asian	i came here by myself for dinner and ordered a pad thai and thai tea . their food is fine , you can find similar quality thai food in madison elsewhere . here is the fun part : not a single time the server came to my table and asked about the meal . she gave the check to me when i 'm not even half way done with my meal . the only time that she asked a question to me is when she returned the credit card slip and " reminded " me , this receipt did not include tip , you need to tip me ...
asian	no tea , no water , slow service . bad artitude . never ever come here again . waiting on the table for over 20 min with no water or tea .
asian	staff was very rude . i had an appointment but still had to wait 2 hours ! they rushed through the pictures . no real backgrounds were offered . just a black sheet & a dirty white sheet . i could have just hung up a sheet in my house & taken better photos with my iphone .
asian	we waited for an hour only to be given a cold bibimbap . had to walk out cause we didn 't want to eat other people 's leftovers .
asian	we phoned wok du chef and ordered : spicy peanut noodles with chicken , wonton soup , egg rolls and sesame beef . the spicy peanut noodles were not even close to spicy and the chicken was rubbery . same consistency for the beef . wontons were fine but the broth was way too condensed . egg rolls were good . and the delivery person was really rude even though we were waiting for him and gave a good tip . not cool for the food .
asian	awe man i don 't know what i was smoking when i decided to go in here lol , the food isn 't satisfying and u might think since it 's super cheap u want to stuff ur face , u won 't want to !
asian	fresh and everything . however , it took 2 hours for us to receive our food . called at 5 : 42pm and didn 't get it till 7 : 35pm . we have three kids under 5 who were so hungry ... prob would have been faster going somewhere else ... 2 hours is just ridiculous ! 1 star for good food ... zero for terrible delivery ! and 1 for the apology and kind man who delivered !
asian	but the rolls were overpriced and although the waiter was attentive , we were unable to enjoy our meal once the rolls arrived , every 5 minutes the waiter would be at our table asking " is there anything else i could get you " as if we were being rushed out . come to find out the restaurant didn 't close for another hour !
asian	i got 3 bahn mi togo and a large soup 22 $ ! awesome food taste good feels good ! gooo ! ! ! ....... nvm this place sux had to chafe my 5 star to 1 star since it took 40 min to make a bahnmi only 2 customers here booooo
asian	this used to be a 5 star but i 'm now updating it . they mandate a 15 % tip and it goes to the owner to pay for the staff . they add it in and write it on your check for you . terrible and very illegal !
asian	what a scam ! we will not be going back there ! plenty of good sushi places in az ! but to sneak things in to make a few $ ? shady if you ask me !
asian	tried to have a great romantic experience here but was essentially rushed through dinner . my wife and i laughed afterwards . we didn 't mind the prices , but it seems like they didn 't want to ensure repeat business . tip : please try to train a little friendliness into your staff from reservations to the servers , especially for people who try out the restaurant for the first time . or tip to customers : don 't tell your server that it is your first time there or you may be talked down to and rushed out the door .
asian	if you want to spend 10years here waiting for sushi this is def . your place !
asian	i recommend calling ahead with a take out order and eating their delicious food in the comfort of your own home . 2 stars for service and 4 stars for food . just spent 2 hours there , watching people who had arrived after we did get their food and even leave before we got our main dishes . food was great , won 't be eating in the restaurant again .
asian	worst friend rice i have ever had , it was mush . when your order noodles it just noodles and chicken , veggies are extra
asian	a big bug / insect in chicken ! ! ! we reported to the waitress . they said they will talk to manager . the worst thing is the manager came out and say they already throw the food and the food is no problem ! wth is that attitude ? ? ! ! ? ? the manager ask me to find out the insect which he already throw in garbage can . omg and i 'm feeling stomacha right now and going to the hospital . the worst restaurant i 've ever been ! wait , should i call it resurant ?
asian	all of the dinners came with the sauce on the side . what the ? ordered the golden wok chicken and the general tao 's chicken . again , sauces on the side ( why ? ! ) and not much flavor anyway . this was definitely the bud light of chinese take out .
asian	all products from true foods and restaurant depot ( per the " chef " ) . all bottom of the barrel . all frozen seafood ( again , per chef ) . over breaded and drenched in ponzu to mask the poor quality . if you don 't know your sushi you will leave unimpressed at the least . if you enjoy quality sushi , you will ask for your money back and leave hungry as we did . skip it .
asian	after a small wait , we got to the front of the line . the restaurant was about half full , but they told us no more table were available . no problem , the bar is fine . oh - and " we 're also out of menus . " ok . then , the kicker ! they have live beta fish swimming at each table with a floating candle in their tiny pathetic little glass bowls . we left immediately . now , i know someone will write and say " well you 're eating fish - isn 't it the same thing ? " nope , not for me . i 'm just not down with animals for human entertainment .
asian	an insult to east asia . no telling how many times the chicken had been re-heated , even the rice was bland . the egg roll was under-cooked , also . i 've lived in asia and i never had a meal this bad .
asian	we also ordered a singapore noodle and it was bland could not find any beef pr shrimp it was horrible .... and pricey too ! !
asian	awful awful awful . the chicken was too sweet , and while it looks like a big sandwich with a lot , it 's a whole lot of nothing . no flavour , stale , tasteless ... and the old guy serving was also pretty rude . why be rude ? no one will come back to visit . i 'd rather go across the street to a real vietnamese banh mi shop .
asian	i had a complete lapse of judgment and picked up a meal here . don 't repeat my mistake . the food is low quality , drowning in badly made sauces , and not even close to healthy . chinese can be done well , but this isn 't it . it 's a shame that so many vegetables were wasted in a poor attempt to make these dishes . it 's not a buffet -- it 's counter where you point and they scoop . there are around five entrees , rice and noodles . you can sit down in a sticky booth or just take your styrofoam container with you .
asian	bland is the nicest word to use to describe the food . atrocious would actually be more appropriate . i like to give any place the benefit of the doubt , but i 'll never step foot in here again . highly recommend panda express over this " food "
asian	just tried to have lunch from this place and am regretting . used to be good , their lemon chicken was the best . now i don 't know what has happened . the side of rice noodles used to be great , now they pretend angel hair pasta is made from rice ... no , it 's just pasta . each time i tried to eat a piece of the fusion chicken i had to spit it out , super stringy and fatty . disgusting . don 't eat here it is terrible .
asian	lots of choice but crappy food . service was also pretty bad .
asian	bad service ! bad food ! bad attitude from the waitress . run from this place !
asian	awful experience . i 've had pho plenty of times and here , they think that you don 't know the difference between full slices of rare beef and the fatty tissue and tendon , usually discarded . this was not a pleasant experience . they try their best to pull one over on you . not ok . i 'd check out other places in the area , i 've had many good experiences at other local pho .
asian	really bad service . we went at 9 45 and they said as or last call is at 10 we won 't take ur order as you might not enjoy the food . this is the manager of the place . when i ordered normal food they were out of veggies and i ended up getting a whole lot of broccoli and chicken . thai green curry was like re heated food . bad service bad food . so if i r looking for a spring rolls there are many in toronto just avoid this its just bad .
asian	they slam the food on your table and they include 15 % tip on your lunch bill even though there 's 4 or less in your party . i found plastic on my sweet and sour soup and the waiter claims it was from the bamboo shoots , who 's he kiddin ! i also remember when we went for a family dinner , the waiter had the nerve to ask for his tip because he was headed home . really the worst ! i 'm done with this place and never eating here again . this place makes all the other sam woo chains look bad .
asian	bar wings were inedible , the beef was inedible , the seared tuna was gray and disgusting , and the rolls were boring . sixty dollars later , and my daughter and i left most of the food on our plate . server was indifferent .
asian	bathroom smelled terrible , no soap or towels , and when i alerted our server to this he told me to use the one upstairs . never mind that i just watched one of the cooks leave the same bathroom where he couldn 't possibly have washed his hands . the service was lazy and the tofu and vegetables that we ordered were soaked in oil and flavorless . the rice tasted like it was cooked in weird butter . there are so many better asian places on state street , this place was worse than the chin 's it replaced .
asian	soup was absolutely disgusting . spring rolls were bland and flavorless . my meal along with my girlfriend 's meal were totally bland and flavorless . absolutely disgusting and repulsive . we were starving , ate almost none of our food , and threw it all out . completely lost our appetites . never again . way better options all around lakewood like banana blossom . avoid this place .
asian	there are so many better places around south charlotte than this sad excuse of a restaurant . the food is tasteless , service is crappy , restaurant is dirty . please do yourself a favor and skip .
asian	food was overall bad , staff was not nice , our order was wrong and we 've also been overcharged for a dish . when we told them they didn 't even apologize . an experience to forget . spadina avenue 's worst nightmare .
asian	insect issues at our table and rude staff . always and issue here even with take out orders . the lady that 's the night manager is extremely rude and unapologetic about her staff when notified . we have even been turned away when it was a quarter til closing by her . do not patronize this establishment . they treat customers poorly here .
asian	they were so rude i had to walk out . didn 't seem very interested in serving me at all . i felt like i was bothering them .
asian	waited 20 plus minutes , they had multiple people with my name on their list ( i was before the first person ) . they called my name and a party of 2 sat in my place ( i 'm a party of 5 ) and no apology . in fact the , the guy said . i did just sit katie . see it 's crossed off . no kidding i see that . thanks for ruining my night with my family ! a simple apology goes a long way people . if you can 't seem to check a list throughly then maybe you shouldn 't be allowed to sit people . 2 is a smaller number than 5 .
asian	when i tried to call the restaurant to let them know their driver dropped off the wrong order to me i was deliberately hung up on at least 5 times by a woman working there . i spent 45 minutes just trying to get a hold of someone who could fix this problem . finally , 2 hours after the " promised delivery time " they answered their phone and the delivery came but there was food missing from my order ... on top of everything i automatically added a $ 10 tip when i placed my order , what a waste . i won 't be eating here again . too bad because i was a frequent customer and really enjoyed the food ...
asian	will not return . they forgot to put rice in our take out order and one of my friends found a piece of paper cooked in with her steak . not worth the price for the poor service .
asian	i waited 1 1 / 2 hour for my delivery of two lunches . i cancelled the order and will never patronize this business .
asian	while the food is ultimately good , ordering take out from there took over 2 hours . find somewhere else .
asian	don 't waste your time , money , energy , breath or anything on this place . i have never had such bad service and such mediocre food . the only saving grace was the 50 % discount they gave us at the end to try to make up for it . in all honesty it wasn 't even worth the 50 % we paid . in all honesty that place isn 't even worth the energy to write this bad review .
asian	average food and service does not make up for one of the worse dining experiences of my life . beware if you expect to spend more than an hour eating . they 'll ask you to leave . they don 't need to worry - we 'll never return .
asian	food is ok . i 'd rather have panda express over this place any day . absolutely rude service and they have a 7 year old running the cash register . too many other options around to settle on this dirty place .
asian	food takes forever and doesn 't come at the same time . they are more concerned about getting take out food on time . i won 't return .
asian	had a table for 3 people and placed our orders at one time . the meal was not delivered together . each person had to wait 10 minutes apart to get served . the blonde waitress yelled at us 3 separate times for asking that our food be delivered together so we could eat as a group . soups were thin and over salted , tasted like campbells soup . a customer dropped fruit on the floor and the waitress did not bother to pick it up . someone could have slipped on the floor . if you like to be entertained by a waitress that yells at the customer this is the place for you , it reminded me of the soup nazi on seinfeld .
asian	we were excited to dine here , but were extremely dissapointed . the waiter was rude , and not attentive . the food didn 't taste like anything ; you could taste the mayo on the prawn , so much so that you had to scrape the crust off . overall , this restaurant was garbage and if i had paid for the meal i would have been furious . i happened to have a second complementary dinner to jade , and did not use this as i was so disgusted with my experience .
asian	ordered food for delivery and it was 1.5hr late and when i called they were non-chalant & unapologetic . i cancelled . in a city like montreal with so many restaurants this awful service has no place .
asian	service was bad . the server was so disinterested and didn 't even ask if we wanted a box for the half a plate of leftover food . which we wouldn 't have because the chicken was not good . restaurant was not clean . the bottles of sauces on the tables were sticky with sauce running down them . all of this cost us over $ 40 for lunch . save your money and go to hunan coventry .
asian	the servers are rude . food average at best . simply horrible experience . one server in fact asked me to leave the table as i had already ordered at the bar . and then , as i was waiting for my food at the bar she asked me to stand at the entrance by the door as she needed more space . and all this as if she is doing me a favor serving the food , when i have paid for it . lost 20 dollars , i say . never ever again .
asian	went there for lunch , place wasn 't busy at all . took them forever to get our food and when we got it it was cold . all there dishes are seasoned the same way the only difference is that is the sauce that they put on top . very bad flavor not to mention the taste of the old oil that 's probably haven 't been changed in a while . save your money and go somewhere else
asian	never in all the years has that been told to us ... like saying you have to pay extra for sauce on a plate of spaghetti ... out of pure principle ( and insulting my intelligence ) i cancelled our order that would have been late even if i would have been an idiot and paid extra for red peppers ... i just don 't get places like this .. do they not realize the american restaurants are built on customer satisfaction , good food , word of mouth and referral 's / repeat business ... for probably about 25 cents worth of red peppers ( their cost ) they lost almost an $ 80 delivery order ... penny wise and pound foolish ....
asian	cheap price . you get what you pay for i guess . waiters & hostess don 't bother taking to you much at all .
asian	server gave us the wrong drink order to start . we ordered three rolls for dinner and a starter . well the rolls were dropped off , the starter didn 't come until half an hour later . we were never given plates or utensils and after 20 minutes of sitting there with food and no utensils we had to get up and grab them off another table . the rice on the sushi was awful and over cooked ! and to top off an awful dinner . the server did not wash his hands after going to the bathroom . how we know- their sinks are oddly outside the bathroom . if you 've been there you know what i mean .
asian	dont waste your time . me and my family came in here to visit the restaurant and we felt so uncomftorable . owner of the place walked around as a king thinking he owned entire cleveland . tomo sounds like nomo . dont bother . on top of it over priced for something that you could even get at regular carry out place .
asian	awful food .. bad experience .. veg pakora were burnt and not cooked ... then the manager did not want to credit ...
asian	food comes super quick but each item was a disappointment . ever wondered how to mess up edimame ? make it limp and grey and don 't bother to salt it . asparagus with grilled pork ? make that asparagus wrapped in a circle of gelatinous almost uncooked bacon . awful ! i could go on but there were 5 awful items that followed . and terrible value , at $ 28 plus tip for dinner including a sprite . i will never ever ever return .
asian	i am sushi connoisseur and realized right off the bat that their sushi is barely even sushi grade sushi . no vibrant colors in their sushi , it 's like it 's weeks old . i tried ordering sesame chicken ( nobody should mess up sesame chicken as a pad thai restaurant ) .. overly breaded , unknown stringy meat that may have been deer roadkill just like that restaurant in north carolina . i 've given pad thai 4 chances , which i normally don 't do , they failed every single time at serving me a satisfying meal .
asian	the bits that did exist were not breast and very chewy . service was also woeful , left us alone for ages until we started putting on our coats to leave and had to go to the counter to get my change . they don 't accept credit cards either but don 't bother to put up a sign .
asian	food is gross , you do not know what you are eating . it is not good at all .
asian	" potato salad on the salad bar tasted rancid , sweet and sour sauce tasted like heated cherry koolaid . chicken for sweet and sour chicken was dry and tough . spring rolls had horrible flavor and were very greasy . paid $ 58 for a family of 5 huge huge waste of money .
asian	only one dish was edible and the selection was not good . staff we rude and plates were dirty . please do not waste your hard earned money here .
asian	ordered mongolian beef was all onion .. when i called to complain i was told .. sorry thats how we serve it .. waste of $ 20
asian	shared mongolian beef with wife . cheapest cut of meat i have ever had . chewed like a rubber tire . for $ 24 they really failed miserably and then added insult to injury with a portion of rice that was in a mini bowl the size of a cup . shame shame to the tightwad owners
asian	they use minute rice . over-priced . food is terrible . will never order from here again ! ! ! not authentic chinese food . blagth ! ! ! ! !
asian	awful , food was not good , people with me got sick and will not go there again .
asian	food was so salty that i could not finish it and i was so hungry ! spring rolls were tasteless . place is reasonably clean if you don 't mind bits of leftover food from the last diners under your feet ... won 't be back . i love pho ! so sad !
asian	worst rib tips i 've ever had , and it wasn 't particularly close . i still ate them because i really like tips , but i did not finish the slaw , which had a peculiar smell to it . not sure why this is a place that exists .
asian	the fish tasted like bleach , the black bean chicken was bland , the other main course dishes were not edible and three of us left with stomach pain . i hear they 're good for dim sum but stay away for dinner
asian	asked for eggplant basil zero heat , it came back spicy with 2 leaves of basil ! one dead a week ago ! never again
asian	super greasy and tasted a bit bitter as well . the batter was falling off of the chicken and the meat lacked flavors . only ordered because it was cheap and they delivered but probably would not order again . did not like their fried chicken , nope , na-ah .
asian	but its awful not 2 mention the fact that they don 't have fried rice .... i paid $ 5 for a half of a half glass of wine ! ! who taught these people how to measure out a glass of wine .
asian	got the pad thai and cold rolls. cold rolls were ok but not great. pad thai was flavorless and disgusting. noodles were bright orange ... ?
asian	quite possibly the worst service ever experienced . if i could give this place 0 stars i would gladly do so . sam woo used to be good , but their pathetic excuse for service has carried over and left a bad taste in my mouth . way overpriced , will never return , you couldn 't pay me to !
asian	if i could give negative stars i would . the chicken in my bowl was raw and slimy or pink . i called to let them know they were serving raw chicken and the manager told me she could refund my money , but i would have to come back in for a refund . it could be reversed to my card witt my receipt number . horrible customer service . cold food . i will never return . hopefully i 'm not sick all night from the few pieces i didn 't spit out before i threw the whole thing away .
asian	they will treat you like a second class citizen . didn 't even get a side plate like the rest of my party . soooo hungry ! ! don 't come here if you are veg ! ! !
asian	place is just strange ! there are much better asian places around !
asian	i ordered satay wings , crab ragoon and green curry with beef . the wings were soggy . the crab ragoon tasted like store bought vegetable cream cheese with string carrots mixed in . the worst green curry , the beef was weird . i never find it funny when i hear ppl joke about cat meat but i 'm telling you i 've had beef from many restaurants throughout the years-that was not beef . disgusting .
asian	i ordered takeout , and when i showed up a half hour later as they said to , they hadn 't even processed the order . the person i talked to was unapologetic and acted like it shouldn 't be a big deal for me to put in my order again and wait another half hour . this was my first experience here , and i 'll never return .
asian	i really wanted ramen so we gambled even though others have given it poor reviews . it was practically inedible . i have suspicions that the meat was not , in fact , beef . there was a hard bone or something in the pork soup dumplings . the pork belly sliders were dry and contained what i would compare to a thin slice of deli ham . the quality was so sketchy that i even felt weird about drinking the bubble tea .
asian	they have been through ownership changes a lot and it just keeps getting worse . after my delivery order came an hour and a half later , i was treated to a dynamite roll that was devoid of shrimp tempura and crammed with avocado . i should have just ordered an avocado role to be honest . the spicy chicken appetizer ? yeah if you like chewing on rubber with some sauce splashed on it sparingly . how do you get skimpy with the spicy sauce ? ? just don 't go there . go down the street to sashimi island if you must . or learn to make sushi and just make it at home . probably better than eating this garbage .
asian	it may be cheap and fast , but that is exactly what you get . fried rice tastes like dirt . chicken lo mein had no flavor and the consistency of a bowl of snot . and everything else we got was just utterly disappointing with little to no flavor . don 't waste your money . you are better off getting a bag of frozen chinese food from the grocery store and eating it cold . worst chinese food ever ! ! !
asian	if you had authentic pad thai you can definitely tell the difference . beef was very tough and the taste was bland . sorry to say but this place will eventually close down soon . only good thing was the staff was very friendly .
asian	i took my lunch break at a new place was excited to try and came out so disappointed . ordered 2 bowls of soup to go after waiting about 10 minutes before anyone would help me . i was handled a bag of 4 take out bowls of soup and told they didn 't have the large bowls in stock and i literally had to ask for the accompanying tortillas and another spoon for my co-workers soup . mind you i paid $ 14 for 2 bowls of soup ! and the soup has almost zero meat in it . who puts crunchy tortola strips in a take out soup ? ! ? ! awful . our office will not be running here for lunch .
asian	i used to go here as an undergrad and recently paid them a visit . i was going to krannert for a play and was running a bit late for a full fledge sit down restaurant , and i thought basil thai would be a fair compromise given their proximity and relatively quick serve . i ordered their massaman curry and it was just plain awful . the rice was cooked too long and was on it way to becoming congee . the curry itself was tasteless , way too salty , and over spiced to the point of being bitter . the pork was over cooked . i took about two bites and tossed the entire thing . complete waste of like $ 9 .
asian	i 've been 3xs each time i said i 'll never be back . but i can promise this time i will not be back . first of all the place is sooo dirty . tables are always dirty , floor and worst of all the dishes . my wine glass had lipstick on it . this last time my salmon was warm in my philly roll . they didn 't even offer to take it off my bill even tho i couldn 't eat it . i just paid and will never go back ! ! it 's wayyy over priced too . stay away ! ! ! !
asian	i came here with a friend after getting shaved snow from across the street . the first thing i noticed when i walked in was the smell of urine , my friend thought it smelled like bathroom cleaner- nonetheless awful . the menu options weren 't great and there was no soy sauce . my friend got the spicy miso broth which was too spicy for her , and i got the regular seaweed broth which was just hot water with the slightest tint of green color- no flavor whatsoever . maybe because i 'm from new york and i 'm spoiled by the good shabu shabu there , but this place might be las vegas ' biggest let down , right alongside yoshinoya .
asian	food was soooo mediocre . no table service and the machine was out of iced tea and ice ! they brought us ice in a cup from the back . this was their grand opening no less ! i will not be back ! there are so many chinese restaurants nearby with good food and decent table service . this place is a joke !
asian	you aren 't hungry anymore by the time food comes . food is okay . i am writing this waiting for my biryani to come .
asian	won 't be coming back again . the employees inside does not know what they 're doing . came here on a weekday and there was one table inside and completely dead . including my table , 2 tables in the restaurant at 7 pm at night ! after coming here i can see why . poor service . restaurant is very unsanitary and gross . the entrance of the restaurant had spider webs and looks like no one bothered to clean since it opened . the food looked nothing like the photo . the taste was a disappointment ! !
asian	i placed an online order and it was going to take 95 minutes , i called to confirm and they said they had only one delivery driver working ! they did not offer any type of compensation for future order , i will never order again . dominoes and pizza hut are far better options ! wayne gorsek
asian	maybe if you are used to buying the discount meat at the store this would be an upgrade but our filet cuts were so tough that i couldn 't even finish mine . i ended up giving it to the dogs , i feel so taken advantage off . they should not say this is premium meat because it isn 't . i was also told we could get a refund , not the case , they will just exchange it for another round of tough meat . don 't get taken advantage of , just say no , for this price you can get much better meat at the grocery store .
asian	never again ! ! ! ! ! i had like 4piece of sushi and 1roll but they only give 2small piece of ginger ! food was super expensive but atmosphere is nice and server ben is knowledgeable
asian	ordered a $ 12 soup . chicken curry . not only was it overpriced for its size , it was slammed full of bay leaves , overpacked with mushrooms , and literal sticks all through out my soup . first and last experience here . i will not return .
asian	ordered a vegetarian dish , that says " curry vegetables . " i got boiled cauliflower and broccoli on bed of overlooked white rice , no curry , no spice at all . which asian restaurant serves bland food ? i have no idea how this restaurant got great reviews . i would go to bac in tremont or saigaon on east 4th . my buddy had an average experience , he added ton of sriracha as well . if you are a meat / potato guy and never tried asian food before , this for you . if you are well travelled and enjoy deep flavors / texture , stay away from this place .
asian	ordered to go as i have for several months . to night there was a mistake . ordered and paid for a large item and received a small container . i just called and was told by the " manager " maggie that she felt it was plenty even as i explained i was in as early as last week and ordered the same exact meal and it was in a different sized container she fought me on the subject . can 't believe the experience . after so many good ones i will never return . great service maggie . i said i would hate to go elsewhere and she responded you are welcome to go elsewhere . wow
asian	our lo mein and spring rolls smelled and tasted awful . i literally spate out the first taste of the spring roll , it was so awful . i would never , ever order from them again .
asian	don 't believe the other reviews ! i have eaten at many pho places and this one is probably the worst . i ordered the pho tai bo vien and the soup had almost no flavor to it . we also had the spring rolls which were disappointing as well . the peanut sauce had very little flavor and the rolls itself were mediocre . definitely not a place i will be coming back to .
asian	idk wat happened . it use to b good but the food was gross and they take forever to bring it out . orange chicken was like crunchy chicken nuggets in some super watery sauce . never again .
asian	i feel bad giving 1 star but the fact we just spent $ 100 for food that was ice cold and poor quality ! we ordered spring rolls twice each time came back with ice inside . my husband order shrimp and steak and it was disgusting . the steak looked like the kind you would have with your eggs in the morning , very thin and rubbery . i was so upset i went to talk to the manager to wait 10 minutes ( place was not busy ) yet i gave up because i realized the negativity wasn 't worth the wait . despite the awful food the server was great ! '
asian	read the reviews and thought this would be a good place to try korean food for the first time . not only was the food awful , i had to hurry home because i became very sick , and cramping up . the worst part was the price . their website says lunch is $ 18 . come to find out , it is only $ 18 during the week . saturdays is $ 28 for lunch . i won 't be back , or recommend .
asian	the server helen tried to talk me out of ordering the daily special because i wasn 't chinese enough to appreciate it ( bigotry from a food server , really ? ) and then one of our meals never came until we reminded her twice . by the time it came everyone else was done eating . the food was okay , nothing particularly good , and thus seriously overpriced . i can 't believe the management of caesar 's palace let 's a place like this set up shop on their premises .
asian	rice was hard and dry . their food bins were almost all empty - all so unappetizing looking . the staff didn 't know much about what the different options were . and - it was just average tasting . with so many great options nearby , i have no idea why anyone would go . for awesome indian , i 'd walk a bit further to indian flame .
asian	they act like they don 't want you there . expensive , low quality food . i would give them zero stars if that was an option . avoid this place .
asian	we had an open table reservation and upon arrival asked for a booth . the hostess refused to seat us in it , yet no one sat in it the entire time we dined . the dishes were filthy with caked on old food . the interior is filthy and worn , in serious need of updating . the seafood tasted fishy and old . yuck . with so many fabulous dining options in vegas i would avoid .
asian	the female blonde bartender took forever to acknowledge us ( monday night and extremely slow ) , and when she finally did , she was rude and came across and really disliking her job . she suggested the lobster app and it was terrible ... couldn 't even find the " lobster " as it was buried underneath so much raw onion and sauce . walk across to kierland and go to ra . don 't waste your money or time .
asian	they even charge extra for left over and was told " any food you left over it must charge extra 6 dollars compare to the regular price of dishes . " be careful when ordering people ! ! ! it 's a place that i def won 't go for the second time ! !
asian	below average for chinese cuisine . plenty of choices in the area . this is a waste of money and time .
asian	food was overpriced and mediocre . my white rice was mushy and did not have any texture and the fried rice ? it came out cold and dried like it 's been sitting around for a while . my waitress never came by to check how we were doing , she only came by to say " i 'm so tired ! " definitely will not be returning .
asian	had to ask for a waiter after 15 minutes of waiting . had to ask for utensils . had to remind waiter of drink request . had to go inside and ask another waiter to find our waiter and get the check . the place was desolate , fyi . won 't go back .
asian	had to ask for silverware and chopsticks . waiter brought out wrong soup , didn 't apologize and acted like i ordered the one he brought out . never brought out soy sauce after we asked for it , had to get it from another table myself . took 20 minutes to get our check . overall was there for almost two hours when we should 've been in and out in less than an hour . average food .
asian	they try not to make eye contact . food isn 't that great , for a cantonese restaurant it 's not really that great quality . been here twice and . don 't think i would try for a 3rd .
asian	awful service .. i don 't recomend this place if you are going to stop by at 7 : 30 when they close at 8 : 00pm .. i stopped by with 8 people and entered because it was clearly open and they said they were already close and could not do anything about it ... the staff didn 't even bother looking us in the eye .. careless and irresponsible service !
asian	last time i went there , there were 3 cars in line and it took 15 minutes . when we got home with our food we didn 't get soy sauce and there was a huge hair in my food . never going back here ... what a shame
asian	not worth the hassle- called to check on our delivery order after 90 minutes and she says " oh yes we just got that in ... " i said " but it 's been 90 minutes ... can we cancel .... " she says " order is on its way ! " and hung up on me : /
asian	i think this restaurant is run by cheaply and cant admit when they are wrong.not coming back here .i suggest you stay far away from this nasty place ...
asian	rude hostess . rude waitress . if you want to clear your dining room out by 10 , dont seat people at 9 : 30 . i 'll never return . there are way too many great thai options who want to serve customers .
asian	server who basically ignored us to chat with friend behind the sushi bar about trying to get laid .
asian	adrian the server was the reason for 1 star , really gave us hard time trying to enjoy this place . no more words . no good . never will come again .
asian	the sign says they close at 9 , we got there at 8 : 25 and the girl that greater us said we close at 9 . ok ? then came over and was super rude at our table . another couple walked in at 8 : 37 and she said " were closed . " " we close the kitchen at 8 : 45 . " the couple didn 't look happy . food was ok , service was terrible . i will never be back . i will spend my money were its appreciated .
asian	the young waitress with braces was absolutely rude . the service used to be great . i would advise not eating here . mr. thai bistro has way better service . will be eating there from now on .
asian	they pretty much just toss the menu to you and leave for the following 20 minutes . don 't take your significant other here for a date or anything important . my valentines day was basically ruined , which is why i 'm spending time warning you guys . also , their soups are disgusting.this is what you call " tamato egg drop soup " ? ... seriously ! ? more like fried egg , hideous spinach , and salty water .
asian	it would be good if our hostess just informed us that some of the rolls ordered weren 't available instead if making us wait with blank stares . the rolls are drenched in sauce that 's not flattering to the palate at all . though its been a while since i was last here , it seems that they 've lost their edge & not conscious of the fact that we 're here whilst everyone else in the restaurant is being served promptly . very very upsetting .
asian	came here with the family to have good time and good food but seriously disappointed . just simply awful
asian	took the lady over ten minutes to take our order of one angelina special . quoted us $ 21 something for a medium pizza and said it would be 45 minutes to and hour for delivery . after waiting for over an hour and a half we called and asked where our pizza was , they told us it would be 5 minutes . 40 minutes later we call and speak to 3 people finishing with " kari " she never apologized , never offered compensation , nothing ! we will never give this place another order . want to waste your time ? go here . food quality is horrible , i 've heard , and the place is extremely dirty .
asian	really unprofessional . never coming back or ordering from there again . would give 0 stars if i could .
asian	more than half the things i ordered never came , do not recommend coming here with more than 2 people unless you want to wait 40 minutes for your food
asian	service was awful . nobody asked us for water . no condiments . no utensils . the food is bland . we had the chow fun , kung pao shrimp , buddhist feast mixed vegetables and seav mai . all bland . i think their xiaolongbao ( steamed dumplings ) was raw . their only good thing was their pastries and eggplant hot pot . do not recommend
asian	after i decided to ask the hostess she pointed us to a table of four that had been available the whole time we were there . we sat down and no one came in the first couple of minutes so we just decided to leave . terrible .
asian	we came in at exactly 11am and were the only customers in the restaurant . we got our menus and drinks quickly ( within a minute ) but the waiter didn 't come back until 11 : 15 to get our order , again we were the only people there ! but there were 3 employees up at the counter . food is average . we will probably not be coming back due to the awful service .
asian	weren 't given drinks , soup , or salad until after the hibachi was ready . i don 't know what 's happened to this place but we won 't be back .
asian	workers could barely speak english and i had to repeat my order at least 5 times until they understood me and it took two people to take my order . it cost me $ 18 for two small sandwich combos . i will not be going back .
asian	so expensive and not enough for 3 people . the conveyor belt is so useless . all it does is spin around the belt over and over again . it doesn 't have any selection in it . it is also over priced for bite sized portions . the chinese pancake was disgusting . it literally tasted like the ones you get in the frozen aisle at 168 . that was over priced too . for one of those frozen , store bought ones , it was $ 5 . do not go here .
asian	awful , soft boiled egg became salty hard boiled egg , japanese style cha chu became chinese style pork belly , bubble tea already asked for light sugar but still very sweet , pork bone soup very salty , highly " not " recommend , and pricey too .
asian	some of the worst sushi i have ever had . maybe the happy hour menu is full of leftover sushi from the night before , but i 'd rather eat grocery store sushi . mushy and unappetizing . thank goodness i didn 't pay for the same items at $ 20 each . $ 50 i wasted at happy hour here . never again . worst sushi experience by far . save your money and go somewhere else . yuck !
asian	staff was incredibly slow and incompetent . i had to repeat my order to the same girl 4 separate times . teriyaki and orange chicken . each time she just stared off into space for several seconds and then said " what was that . " definitely stoned . i hope ? food was average panda , just a little extra soggy and cold . they couldn 't manage to cut the teriyaki chicken so i had giant pieces to try to manage without breaking my plastic fork . don 't do it . just get chick fil a or something .
asian	sushi came out really fast and was exceedingly so-so . then , we waited . and waited . and waited for the rest of our order . about 30 minutes later , we had to ask for the manager , who said : " if you can 't wait for your food , you can leave . " we left , never going back . suggest you go elsewhere too to a avoid what we experienced . seriously , the worst .
asian	everything is just tempura filling . very little fish . got most of our order wrong . would never eat here again .
asian	if you like avocado at all don 't come here every single piece of avocado was brown and rotting . everything was warm and overall mediocre . the pacific roll was the best thing they had at their first location but at this location it 's not very good at all . the place is always empty which goes to show how it is . if you can drive to a better sushi place don 't bother stopping here .
asian	not friendly at all . the waitress had such a bad attitude . never again . not even for free ! ! ! ! ! !
asian	wouldn 't wish my worst enemy to go here . was slimey and old . yuck yuck yuck
asian	after looking at a menu they give you a pad and ask you to write down what you want . got annoyed when we asked questions . chicken with pecans was so goopy i was disgusted . chicken was covered in fat . ate a quarter of it and left it . no taste to it at all covered it in mustard just to get it down . very disappointed
asian	we waited 2 hours for an order and after it never showed up asked for a refund . manager rudely hung up on us after weaving very obvious lies and refused to refund us for our ( overpriced ) meal .
asian	we ordered lunch specials with teriyaki chicken and another with salmon . the chicken had been marinated for too long in salt and pepper making me wonder if that chicken was super old . both plates were drowning in sauce . the side salads were icey cold and going brown . we had some sushi as well , nothing too special . giving the place an extra point for decent service .
asian	terrible example of hibachi . the food by no means is fresh . wouldn 't suggest this to my worst enemy . if you want to get sick this is your place . i wish i could give them 0 stars .
asian	the only thing worse than the service is the food . overpriced bland food served by staff who would rather shoot the breeze with each other than actually wait tables . because of the poor service , i left a small tip ( i probably should have given nothing ) and believe it or not , when i checked my credit card statement i noticed that the amount had been changed . i called the restaurant and after investigating , they confirmed that the waiter had actually crossed out the amount of the tip and written in another amount ! blatant theft and credit card fraud ! if you go ( which i wouldn 't recommend ) , pay with cash .
asian	the sauce ( thai ) was bad , not even sure what it tasted like . very expensive for what i got . i will never go back . no wonder it was half empty at lunch !
asian	they sat us , gave us a menu , waited 15 minutes and the waiter returned and stated we could not order off the menu due to a catering event they had for 700 . offered us a buffet option which we declined and departed . so we went to satay on paradise . much better ! !
asian	the sushi is average , at best , and over priced . the service is terrible . i would highly recommend that you travel a few more blocks to sushi rock .
asian	this restaurant used to be fortune but then they closed and i 'm pretty sure this one will too . the price is just a lil . cheaper then most dim sum , so i guess u get what u pay for ! it 's a good thing i only bought around 7 items to go and tried it out at . every item i ordered was a big disappointment ( lack in flavor , taste and texture ) i 'm so sick of trying out new dim sum restaurants cuz i always end up going back to my one and only place ( ping pang pong )
asian	too many noodles , not enough meat in their special - i was fishing around just to find some tendon ( which was quite soft , i have to say ) . they mix in the bean sprouts rather than serve it on the side , which i don 't like , and they don 't even understand viet ... so ordering a ca phe sua was a bit confusing - especially as they don 't have it anyway ! for what you get for $ 8 , i 'd say find a better place .
asian	waited 50 minutes for a char sui and rice . withing that 50 mins , the fire alarm went off 3 times ! would not recommend this place !
asian	waited ten minutes for waters then waited another 15 minutes for just two rolls . the food did not taste fresh at all and even the fish in the sushi bar window looked terrible . the waiters would stand right in between my boyfriend and i and shout over our heads to the sushi chef behind the bar . was totally awkward and rude and just plain weird . the miso soup was hot and didn 't taste bad though kind of bland . overall bad experience . will not go back .
asian	adequate food , but will not visit again . forced customers to pay 15 % gratuity while they deserve none .
asian	wanted to try a new place today and decided to swing by . the fried rice was mushy , the low mein was bloated and mushy , the main dishes like orange chicken and broccoli beef were cold . the egg rolls tasted like they had cinnamon in them . most of the dishes looked like they had been sitting on the buffet unchanged for quite a while . the service was no better . we were greeted abruptly as if we were interrupting something at the door and were seated . we got our drinks and that was the last time our server came by our table . the wait staff stood at their station on their cell phones . we won 't be back .
asian	we stopped with all the best expectations- first they were out of ginger , then they gave my sashimi to some one at at the bar , tried to serve us tea warmed up in a microwave and then came back to explain they could make hot water . they got the sushi order completely screwed up . never again . had to go to whole foods to finish dinner .
asian	we used to come here when we were in town from hawaii and loved it . this time we had the all you can eat option and the quality was poor at best . service was okay , not too friendly as before . my daughter commented that her shrimp sushi was slimy .... uugghhh . some of the dishes were good , the steak , but steak at a sushi restaurant ? too much mayo on the dishes , fish was covered in all types of sauces , too overwhelming . ice cream dessert was not too good also .
asian	where is the flavor ? ! i ordered delivery tonight and got the egg rolls , tom kah soup and authentic pad thai . every single item lacked any flavor . i even asked for the soup to be medium spicy and the pad thai to be medium to hot . the pad thai has got to be one of the worst i have ever eaten . there is no egg , no tofu and no peanuts which is listed as included on the menu . it literally is just greasy noodles with a few pieces of chicken and a wedge of lime . terrible , i won 't be ordering from this place again . do yourself a favor and order from somewhere else .
asian	where to begin ? the food is served on plastic plates and bowls with the name of another restaurant on them . the selection is meager unless you want sushi . the appetizers are on the last page of the menu . the food was bland and comparable to food you would get at a take-out chinese place with photos of dishes above the counter . service was slow . the manager walked around the dining area but did not ask anyone about their meal ; but he did stop to blow his nose in the middle of the dining area .
asian	awful ..... will never order from again waiting over an hour and a half for delivery when it was suppose to be a 45 minute delivery
asian	worst " chinese " food ever . chicken ball batter was questionable . beef definitely tasted off . even the rice was bad . how do you screw up chicken fried rice ? !
asian	worst meal i 've had in vegas . placed an order for a delivery- granted we only live round the corner . was quoted an hour for delivery- it finally arrived after 1 hour and 20minutes . food was warm , not hot . food was disgusting , ordered 2 beef dishes that tasted exactly the same . egg rolls just tasted of cabbage with black pepper , and the crab rangoons- either they had no crab in them or we didn 't receive them at all.not feeling too great after the couple of mouthfuls we had either a massive let down and disappointment . definately go elsewhere.big thumbs down from me .
asian	you get 10 % off if paying by cash . great if you are looking for a system flush . nothing beats having all you can eat japanese then spending hours on the toilet after . do not expect nice decor , it 's more like a diner style . on the flip side , they do have a good variety of choices . staff are friendly . non- alcoholic drink comes free with meal . do not order the takala-whatever version of sashimi .
asian	food quality was good but all the flavours felt like everything was based on soy sauce . being from vancouver , i could be clouded by the chinese food there . prices were average with the classic woks at $ 10.99 to $ 13.99 with entrees being around $ 18 . portion size for the lunches were pretty good and the service was decent . too bad it wasn 't better in overall quality . go for : quick seating don 't go for : good food
asian	was very disappointed in the quality of the food . even the miso soup was weak & tasteless .
asian	i 've tried it three times because their version of khao soi is outstanding . but other dishes range from mediocre to terrible . the pad thai here is mushy and tasteless , downright awful ! and the service is consistently atrocious : incredibly slow , rude , and inefficient . they seem like they are still beginners . the one take-out order i had was missing one of the dishes i ordered and i was charged for something i didn 't order in addition to the missing dish . with so many great thai restaurants in toronto , this one has become just too much trouble . avoid it !
asian	super overpriced . you are not missing out on anything here . i must say though the waitress was nice . if you want good service and traditional dishes .. check out chou 's kitchen or szechwan garden in chandler .
asian	the system needs to be fixed . even refills on the drinks are self serve , yet the servers expect a 20 % tip . on the good side , the food was good and was cooked correctly . just hating feeling uncomfortable when i tip as though it 's s buffet 1 or 2 bucks a person and having to worry next time i go in there the way i am viewed .
asian	this is not a restaurant .... it is a 8 seat bar 1 / 2 way in the common area . tuna & salmon was tuff & chewy . chef watches you eat his food so i smiled as i poured soy & downed my roll with ginger .
asian	but i have never felt so stared at like a hawk . not everyone at our party-of-5 table ordered ayce , just my sister and i. so everytime our waitress passed our table , she 'd look at us to check to make sure we weren 't sharing our orders with the others . i guess i can 't blame them since a lot of ppl probably take advantage , but i 've been to many other ayce 's where this has never been a problem .
asian	place is more than half empty and food still took 50 min to get out . half the plates were cold from sitting around in the kitchen . waiter tells us the food was held up because of so many sushi orders at other tables ...... what orders ! this place is empty and the people that are dont have sushi in front of them either .
asian	not only were the shrimps gritty and tasted like they hadn 't been washed - the service was terrible ! now my husband is taiwanese , so i 'm used to talking with in-laws that really have no idea what i 'm saying and pretty much only ask me if my hair is real and if they can pull it , but if you 're a waiter in a restaurant please at least know the english for things on the menu ! i asked for the steamed pork buns and the girl was like : oh no we no have . really ? cause you just brought them to the table beside me . uuugh . i just wanted some pork : (
asian	i thought they 'd be the same , but my boyfriend is convinced the other location is better and homeier . they had a ton of choices , except no lechon or lumpia : ( we got there at 4pm and there were still quite a few people there , so they 're continually refilling the buffet .
asian	the food was flavourful , cheap , filling and just overall delicious . however , they 've recently changed their recipes and our family was very disappointed with the results . the food is now very bland , and none of the dishes we ordered were any good at all . we are all very sad as we will not be returning until the recipes are changed once again , hopefully to what they originally were .
asian	low quality meet with tons of fat .. and the banchan tasted old n weird . dont come here these people r crazy to serve this crap n ask ubto oay $ 26 for low quality meat , overcooked rice , n 5 dishes of banchan that is not fresh or tasty they dont serve any soups or steamed egg with the ayce .
asian	the fish are not fresh , and tasty not good . when we saw the cut roll come out , it look like a sh * t . if you plan to spend $ 20 for your lunch , you can find another else better then this one . also one of the asian skinny guy who works here his so rude ! ! never come back again ! !
asian	was craving to try korean buffet , finally i went . been hearing good reviews about this place . i wasn 't at all impressed with the buffet , made me regret going there . they even charge for the drink . not going back there .
asian	i know alot of ayce sushi places have " rules " but their rules makes me not want to come back . one of them being that we can 't order half rolls until ( as the waitress said ) " the end when you 're too full for full rolls ... " umm ... what ? ?
asian	i felt the quality of fish was pretty bad and there was so many rules for the ayce . it 's probably never a good idea to eat sushi in the desert , so i would save your money and treat yourself to a better place .
asian	recommendation : i would highly recommend that you order some sushi first then decide if you want the ayce . the quality of the fish is average or below . you cannot order sashimi . in my opinion , the best was the lychee sorbet not sushi . i did not find one piece of sushi fresh at all .
asian	their sushi is terrible , and having 8 piece per order makes it even worse , since you will have to finish more of the awful sushi . the non-sushi items are o.k , e.g. the salmon belt , short ribs and skewers etc .
asian	the male servers are rude - throws plates around , takes wrong orders and forgets food . the service is both terrible and slow . food handling here is unsanitary
asian	expect to wait for a long time for the food . the sushi menu isn 't too diverse or different . most sushi rolls are the same with 1 or 2 differences from another sushi roll that 's on the menu . the ordering time is 45 mins for lunch . order a lot when they initially take your order . also , keep track of what you order , chances are .. you will not get it . service : not the best in the world . the staff are so so . i actually witnessed the staff argue with a customer about the wait time . " sorry , you have never waited for food ? we are busy . "
asian	the service is by far the worst i have ever encountered in a restaurant , almost to the point where we had to remind the servers how to do their jobs .
asian	now its a shithole with terrible customer service . they upcharge once you arrive to pick up your food even though the online receipt includes the items . the first time we figured it was a mistake , the second time in a row was unacceptable . we will never order food here again .
asian	my family decided to return here for my birthday dinner . compared to newer places in mississauga , this place has fallen below par . the fish , although not terrible just isn 't as fresh as others . salads are over garnished , to the point where they don 't taste right and their beef sashimi , a dish i used to love here , has fallen below par too . presentation is average . i just wish things were more fresh . hope they improve soon . because after today , i 'd spend the extra 10 min driving to heart sushi in heartland .
asian	customer service is still superb though . today , i ordered a pad-see-yew with beef level 5 - was made in an old pan with burnt scraps , 25 % beef in dish only , there were clumps of chili not blended in the dish , and was drenched in oil . another dish , red curry with chicken , was always lacking chicken pieces , they 've increased prices and cut back on portions and quality , which happens quite often to good restaurants gone bad . sad to say , this used to be my favorite place , but now we will never return and we are currently looking for another thai place to be our go-to .
asian	my mango tilapia was fresh and tasty , but very pricey at $ 14 . from past pics it looks like they used to give two pieces of fish too instead of one , so might be cutting corners . service was also pretty poor and i often had to look around to get a utensil or a drink or the check . if you are in the area and don 't mind how much you spend , you will get a pretty good meal , but i personally prefer better service and am on a tighter budget . unlikely i 'll return . hope you have a better experience .
asian	baaaaaaaad vietnamese food seriously how can they screw up banh cuon like this
asian	i came to this place years ago when i first moved to the valley . the food was sadly less than i remember . i had chow mein and babe had shrimp fried rice . both items were very greasy , lacked flavor and had very little protein . we will not be returning to this establishment . there is way better chinese throughout the valley .
asian	delivered to my company for a lunch meeting . we all ended up throwing everything away . too bad , cause they 're fast and friendly and of all the times we ordered , this was the first time we ever had an issue . it is in an old building , but these days , they should just be more vigilant in making sure their restaurant is " food ' ready .....
asian	this place was average , nothing great .. they did put a slice of lime in the water which was nice . other than that blah ...
asian	love boat ( $ 32.99 ) dinner for 2 was good value as in quantity . but the white tuna was half frozen , the rolls was loosely rolled , the freshness of the fish was meh . had a hard time even finishing that because of the quality . i don 't think i will be back ...
asian	i havent visit this restaurant since 2006. so i dont know how 's the taste of there food now ...
asian	but recently , i return to woodside mall and tried it to see if its still good than before . what i thought it was good turned out to be crap . i ordered a large honeydew with tapioca and the taste just felt very powderly and disgusting . back then i haven 't noticed the decor being so unique but when i actually took a closer look at this place , the sealing has a circular centre that looks unique . i rarely seen any people eating here just ordering bubble tea so i don 't know how is the food here .
asian	getting sick from eating there the two times i have been isn 't so great . i had better luck at ninja city . this may be a coincidence though , none of my friends have experienced the same fate as i have .
asian	we moved to t town & tried this place based off our experiences in tempe & downtown phoenix . this wasn 't the same . ichi ban in tempe & phx were a quick decent lunch time sushi place . so our expectations were already mediocre expecting a lunch experience for dinner . what we got was nothing short of pathetic . go to ah-so in good year if you live on the west side this is the best sushi west of central don 't waste your precisous time or money at ichi ban tolleson .
asian	1h wait for food when there were only 3 other tables with people . bad quality and quantity of food .
asian	over priced food ( felt like cn tower / trump prices ) for small portions - especially the sushi . appetizers took forever to come . will not be coming back .
asian	after all the server didn 't feel sorry when we told him about the service problem . the owner should think about what happened about their service training . not gonna come back again
asian	won 't come back for sure ! ! ! !
asian	asked for soy beverage cuz of lactose intolerance ; reconfirmed if it was soy , and it was not . and i am getting attitude as thought it was my fault . no apologies ; not even an acknowledgment ... so guess something friendly is out of question .
asian	the fish is tasteless , maybe frozen . crust is good and not too thick . we got the curry mango and siricha ... sauces . sauces are good but did not enhance the tasteless fish for me . will not go again .
asian	food was good ... but service bad ! it 's even worse when you go back to talk to the waiter call him by his name and he puts his hand in your face not once but twice and you 're sitting there trying to enjoy your food with your family from out of town and the waitress is yelling at the cook demanding what she needs we ordered drinks and we 're waiting for them and as we 're waiting for them seeing that our party was a party of 6 a party of four came in and got their drinks before we did i would not go back to that restaurant . everyone had attitude no smiles nothing .
asian	we ordered takeout . multiple issues : 1 can 't order children 's menu over the phone . fine , no big deal . 2 wrong order given to us . didn 't realize until my husband got all the way home . mistakes happen . 3 return to ah-so after calling . given lukewarm order with no offer to make fresh or make up for their mistake . getting annoyed . 4 we are now sick to our stomach . never again ! ! ! ! !
asian	the service was fine but the food took forever and there was only one lady serving at lunch time . we ordered 3 rolls and they took about ten minutes in between each one to come out when we ordered there was no one else in the place .... not sure what took so long ? not a very good lunch menu ... no rolls on it .... ? ? / ! ! ! and the hot green tea tasted like hot rain watter , nothing green about it . overall not satisfied and even had one bad piece of fish i had to spit out .. will not be returning . not sure why this place has 5 stars ? : (
asian	they have one chef and he called out sick so all they had was soup and appetizers . oh and if your not asian don 't go here . a couple walked in 20 minutes after us and were paying their bill when we got our food .
asian	bad ! ! bad ! ! ! i read reviews on yelp recommending this but i was beyond disappointed . i ordered the house special spicy . ( beef , pork , chicken and shrimp fried rice ) with breaded shrimp and spring rolls , they all tasted horrible and it wasn 't cheap . i should have ordered from my regular spot with fast delivery and very good tasty food ( new ho king ) also , they delivered my food late . never ordering from here again . never ever !
asian	just got home from ordering to go . rude . food doesn 't taste good . had to wait for it a bit longer than i should have . didn 't even get all of my order . the guys working we 're rude and seemed as though we were bothering them by walking through the door . will never go back .
asian	mauvais mauvais ! sans respect envers les gens ! ! ! ! bad bad bad ! taste very very bad ! liar liar liar liar liar : they don 't respect custumer
asian	on valentines day ... ! ! waiting 30 min to get a drink , another 20 min to get one liltle piece of meet .... i was ignore for the waitress many times and the restaurant was half empty .....
asian	they said only accept cash and debt cards when i pay for the bill , even their menu said accept credit cards . maybe they can avoid paying tax to the government . shark fins soup dumpling is the worse dim sum dish , no shark fins inside , avoid to order it . tastes so so compare to other restaurants at highway 7 .
asian	his attitude toward us was racist in a way . he gave us free sodas but that doesnt fix anything . we didnt appreciate that he would rather return our money than try to make sure our order was being made . i 'd say this restaurant is not very good for to-go orders .
asian	bad , bad , bad. the chow mein was edible and that is literally the nicest thing i can say .
asian	bad . bad . we had orange chicken that was a mush of panko bread crumbs ( ~ 70 % ) and a few pieces of chicken . the jalapeno chicken was the same , 3 impossible to eat with chopsticks pieces of chicken in a huge amount of onions an jalapeno that did not taste like jalapeno but rather like bell peppers . the egg drop soup was kind of okay but looked like hot water with egg . food should look tasty , too . very very disappointed .
asian	3 terrible hours , i kid u not , we will never go back here again. i rather they increased the price from 20 to 25 and give us a real decent buffet like they used to , say about a year ago. now its just really bad. staff were doing their best to mess up or ignore us .
asian	bad services ! ! ! ! u can find better korean somewhere in town ! don 't go here !
asian	bad. bad. not attractive waiters / waitresses. salty food. overpriced pot of tea. not real asian food. no customers. waitresses that do not speak english well. i ordered the sashimi combo on the 1st page. i think. and the lettuce cups. the lettuce cup minced meat was so salty. it was like eating chewy salt with lettuce. like a hamster. go to makino people. look it up .
asian	they offer a $ 19 , $ 25 n $ 32 meal . you ask for the $ 19 n they force you to buy the $ 25 meal even tho you don 't want the meats in the more expensive meal .
asian	we ordered yukhoe , the beef was frozen . we complained , the waitress insisted on telling us it was supposed to be eaten like that , she made us pay for it . rest of the food was not that great and rather expensive . really don 't suggest to go to this one , montreal has so many better korean restos ...
asian	pretty bad . wont go back . for a newly opened place you would think they would try a bit harder .
asian	bad bad service ... offered a big table to 2 small group to share ... skip us for the big party ... this is america we don 't share table here ...
asian	if you wanna charge my tips you should let me know before . after that i paid tips again cause i didn 't know they already charge my tips. and the service was bad like shiiiit and they always keep that shit face with you .
asian	came highly recommended by someone who had been there many many years ago . things have changed . we ordered all over the map ... tofu , chicken. seafood , noodles ... everything was bland and low quality . avoid at all costs .
asian	most dishes were deep fried , high in msg / sodium - not real thai at all
asian	roti kanai was good . tried basil fried noodles , it wasn 't great .
asian	i order the egg rolls to start off with ... we were done after the first bite , it had a bad after taste as if it was rancid . the brisket pho wasn 't any better , broth was lacking flavor and my brisket was still pink because the broth wasn 't steaming hot . i order the chicken fried rice for my daughter ... they should 've called it " fried peas and carrots with an overly cooked brown rubbery egg . " where 's the rice ? ! anyway , will not be back !
asian	no apology from management . it 's one of more expensive selection . obviously not in high demand . someone should have checked the freshness won 't return again for pot luck . signed - my upset stomach
asian	bad congee ... quite thin , sloppy preparation , inferior reconstituted mushrooms , salt soaked chicken , old oil in the fryer stays on the palate from chinese donuts .
asian	bad cooked meals. soft shell cra b was good but sashimi was frozen. overall this place sucks lol i 'm harsh
asian	you have to finish / swallow all of your 3 plates of meet before you can ask for more who eat like that when you go to all you can eat bbq ? they only have 4 sides dishes for you to eat with your meat . no salad ! ! ! i feel sorry for the other good servers there , they don 't get much tip because of the short hair lady . the two stars are for average food they served . i gave 10 % tip for the long hair ladies .
asian	i do red curry and panang at home . order paste from thialand , add coconut milk , add fish sauce and palm sugar . you got curry . dont know what they served me for the chicken curry , or my wife for malaysian peanut curry , but tasted sour and like it has a vinegar base . each of us took two bites and threw it in the trash . samasosas and chicken ginzo small bites tasted like grocery store frozen . i had great hope for this place , but dont waste your time .
asian	waited forever on my food , finally got a call after 1hour and 30minutes that they " needed to verify the order and address " . i have been ordering from that place for awhile . andrew on the phone didn 't care to get my food to me asap , didn 't get an apology , nothing . just indifference .cancelled my order . he didn 't care about that either . go figure .
asian	also try tonorder some stuff in the menu but they didnt have ....
asian	this place sucks ! never coming back here again . they won 't accept my restaurant.com via my phone . they require it printed . who does that nowadays ? i 've been using restaurant.com , and that 's the first time i 've heard of it . also , they automatically charged me 18 % gratuity for 2 people ( supposed to be only parties 5 or more ) - really shady .
asian	it was straight out of a chicken broth can . i order the crabmeat noodle soup . there wasn 't nothing favor it was more topping in it then nothing . and my husband order grill beef ; he said it wasn 't bad . never coming here again . i had better places then this .
asian	cheaply made marble tabletops are dangerous and the manager will blame you for them breaking . i won 't be back here again .
asian	find another sushi restaurant , don 't go here .
asian	bad customer service , did not want to serve sushi one hour before closing , take out took forever .
asian	food is ok . but horrible customer service ruins the whole visit here . once we got seated and open the first page of the menu , the waiter was already rushing us to order . our foods came out and there were no condiments at all . eating not even half way , they gave is the check . while still eating they clean our table ? definitely not coming back .
asian	paid for my meal received a dollar ripped in half . i asked for another dollar . the waitress brought me back a dollar of pennies and nickels . not worth the price you pay compared to siam thai kitchen which is much better quality and price . .
asian	food was okay . but over priced . porkbelly was no taste . bad experience for me , and the sad thing is i brought my latina friends here to try it . they where not impressed . im sorry but fiesta filipina is better than there bbq . but that was just my opinion . im sure some others might disagree with me . there so called " manager " she needs to practice to gave customers a good customer service . but then again i wasn 't surprised , jollibee is as bad customer service also . even crispy town . nakakahiya , kababayan panaman ! !
asian	they never came and explained their rule when we mentioned we were first time there . they even charge $ 14.99 for the under 3 kid. in the end , the lady server came to force us to finish all the food when we r full . that was only 4 pieces of roll left on the dish or they didn 't give us a check to pay . we will never go there again !
asian	fruit are cheap but it 's not a very good quality . i rather pay a little more for a better quality . i didn 't know worker there can get tips from customer . i saw a lady give one of the worker tips and she was all happy and service her , but if you don 't tips them , the service is terrible ! i would never recommend his place .
asian	bad customer service have signs on window stateing lunch specials they dont even have on there menu on tops the short asian guy is a prick when you ask him about it and start yelling at me about it last time i will go there
asian	i asked the waiter to add one more item to our order and he said he doesn 't know who our table helper is and simply left - without letting us know whether he added or not . secondly , it took an hour to get the order . overall super bad experience .
asian	i was going to buy 10 coffee bottles but couldn 't bring everything to the cashier at once . when i told the cashier to pick up 9 more bottles for me , he gave me an attitude and told to walk back there and get it . i didn 't even get my 2 free bottles discount . i should 've just went to chandler .
asian	i came here to buy pancit to go . after this lady that served me instead of ringing up my order so that i can go . she decides to help 3 other people that just walked in . there for killing my time to wait on them ! as for the food it was mediocre .
asian	i just ask for another high chair for my toddler and the waitress give me a dirty look . i order the set black cod dinner and the salmon teriyaki set ; they are not very great . the rice that comes along with the dinner set is not hot . the black cod was salty and the salmon was over cook . i order the avocado sushi ; the sushi rice doesn 't even taste good . as the chef who 's making it don 't have any training at all . not worth the money !
asian	made reservations and we were 5 minutes late . so they gave our table away . then they told us we would have to wait 1 hour .
asian	made us wait for 40 mins before serving anything ! they assured us that they will give us food now and it never came . after we repeatedly told them that its long time we are waiting , give us or we will walk away . then , they started serving . food was ok and not great taste . it was bit salty and looks like made in hurry . also few items was missing from vegetarian thali . 4 star reviews are i believe because of incentive of free lassi . it is not worth even 2 star with this kind of customer dining service !
asian	bad customer service not good food quality if u want to waste money and time they its the place when i made the complaint about my over all experience the owner did not bother to clarify on top says it can happen some time as they are also humans my advice plz don 't visit
asian	our waitress was mad at us when we asked to change the grill and made a noisy sound when put the foods on another plate from the old grill , and she dropped the new grill directly to the oven which scared all of us . she told us we should finish eating all the non-marinated meats before eating the marinated meats . but i think it 's up to us in what orders we eat our food . and be careful ! they charged 15 % tip automatically on your bill no matter what kind of service you got ! !
asian	they stop delivering to you after they get you hooked .
asian	server forget my napkin , he didn 't come back to even ask me how 's my food . i have to asked the hostess for my check . not coming bank and won 't recommend to my friends .
asian	we ask the owner to change it , he gave her attitude and said that 's what she order and will not change it . very low class customer services . we will not come back again .
asian	bad customer service taking advantage for young people / teenagers adding 15 % tip in thier bill ..
asian	terrible communication and my order has gotten messed up three time in a row ! ! ! ! save your time and money by not ordering from here . their " management " has a terrible attitude so i will never order here again .
asian	the staff made a mistake during order taking and served up a wrong dish . when we pointed this out , the lead staff intervened ( a lady with multi colored dyed hair ) hinted that the mistake was ours and suggested we accept the dish since it was already cooked . fearing what they might do if we insist on a change , we reluctantly agreed ... in terms of food , taste was so-so , quite salty and certainly not worth the extra $ $ $ compared to some other restaurants . first and last visit here . hope other customers are not as unlucky .
asian	the workers at this restaurant are the worst people i ever seen in the restaurant business . they are arrogant , over priced food , small portion ! ! ! ! ! ! i would never ever go back to this place'
asian	we called to ask what time their kitchen is open till , lady on the phone said 10pm but when we got there , they said 9.30pm ... and argued with us that it wasn 't what they said . walked off . they need to get a grip on long-term guest satisfaction . also , on yelp their hours of operation show open until 11pm .
asian	went there for take out . they said each person can take 1 box and many small containers for curry . i paid for 2 take outs . they gave me two boxes and 4 containers . after packing up , i asked for one extra container and the waiter says sorry only 2 allowed . they should be honest . food is great but bad service spoils it . heard from many friends that service is bad . they have atleast 6 curries and sides and desert . isnt it fair to ask that people asking for take out get to take atleast 3 curries home ? i guess these reviews may not even be read by them .
asian	bad customers service need 35 dollars to order even from a distance of 2.4 km cheap place
asian	they used to be nice and great food but i guess their business got really good so they don 't need customers . they treat customers like shit !
asian	there are very few options on the menu , so i ordered the chicken fried rice . it was disgusting - the vegetables were mushy and the rice was completely drenched in soy sauce . the rice was so salty that it was inedible . anywhere else in the airport will be better .
asian	12 year old son pulled a huge hair that was in the food from his mouth . asked to just take it back . they billed me for the meal . i asked to have it removed . server said she called the manager and he was willing to give me 50 % off his meal that he didn 't eat . had to wait for a 2nd call and another 15 minutes to call the manager to remove meal . won 't be coming back
asian	bad experience at this todai. prob bc we came in right before they were closing. but still ... some of the typical stuff like sushi wasn 't that great. food was of course was cold or just seemed like it 's been out. it only takes one bad experience for me to just stay away from a place specially when you 're spending like 50 a person. if you spend that much expect the food to be good even when they about to close. learn from my experience and don 't come in like hour before they close .
asian	another 15min to get the other dish . no air conditioner inside , very cold in winter . bad and service . normal food quality
asian	never in my life have complained to any businesses but this domino 's pizza have the bad service and take forever to have the order ready ! took me about 1 hour and 45 minutes ( or more ) to have my order ready ! and gave me attitude ! ! ! what kind of service is thissss ? ? ? ? ? would never come back here again ! ever. it deserve 0 star but no choice ! anyhowwww , the foods are fine though. if you ever consider ordering pizza from this place. just call in and come pick up in 2 hours ! many people were complaining and cancelled orders ! !
asian	too many fly insects in restaurant and manager also not care at all . worst restaurant in madison . yak ! ! !
asian	food wasn 't good at all and chef was mad that he didn 't get a tip for being boring and bad food . kept giving us dirty looks . service was good though .sorry but we will never return here . kobi steakhouse is 10 times better
asian	i went with some friends and a young waitress was very rude from the start gave us very bad service . we asked her to split the check and told us to just divide it ourselves , we defiantly wont be back . the manager though was nice he came and spoke to us .
asian	i think the only normal food is beverage . as a chinese from northeastern , i can 't give even one star for this restaurant .
asian	i order 2 larges pizzas , pasta , wings . after 1 hour waiting for my food to arrive , i called and asked how much longer for my food . they said it was ready and ready to be picked up . first of all , i usually order pizza because its easy to be delivery and offer delivery service . i told them i didn 't have a car there 's no way i can pick up the food . so they deliver and receive it around 1015pm was very disappointed .
asian	i will give them zero star : ( realy disappointed
asian	portions look smaller now with the new carry out plate . i ordered orange chicken and there 's only 3 pieces of orange chicken in my plate . they had ran out of beef and broccoli . they also didn 't have pepsi . horrible service .
asian	usually like this place but won 't be coming back . not going to pay my money to be watched constantly and rushed out .
asian	the food had no flavor . i ordered combination fried rice . the meat tastes old and smelled funny . the rice tasted so plain like no salt . the mustard chili sauce not only do they sell it on the side but it has no flavor either . i also noticed the prices are higher than the other china a go go i have gone . will not ever be coming back .
asian	the go karts don 't run well . the staff is very unpleasant . they cuss and yell at customers ( including children ) if they accidentally bump into the wall or another go kart . this place should be shut down .
asian	the place is crowded with group tourists from china . waiting time is long . but the quality and quantity of the food are also surprisingly bad . will not visit the place again .
asian	the shrimps and oysters are not fresh , also overpriced . not recommended
asian	the waitress let me know from the beginning that she would not have too much time to serve me because she had a big party to tend to so she rushed me to place my order . than i asked for a glass of wine and she said i would need to buy the bottle . problem with that is i 'm driving so ... yeah . than they bring out the bulgogi and for $ 17.00 bucks i got a few bites of meat are you kidding me ! ! . the meat is good , the sides are ok , service not good and the price for the amount of meat is terrible !
asian	waitress was blowing her nose in front of all customers and went right back to tables without cleaning . the fried raman was cooked with dark smelly oil .
asian	bad experience we order the bake salmon roll which supposed to have avocado than we realize the avocado wasn 't on , the waiter toke the menu to the guy to show him what comes with that roll , his reaction said it all , he roll his eyes and when the waiter ask him what to do what that order that was messed up he said throw it in the garbage without even apologizes that he fucked up the order , what a looser
asian	we dropped in at around 8pm last night . i had a party of 5 and they had a few open tables . we got put in a small table with a stool to the side . super cramped , so we decided to walk out . never once were we greeted . we had to tell them we had a party of 5 .
asian	employees are rude and not hospitable . furthermore , management refuses to take responsibility for their employees actions . the negative trickle down effect is more than obvious at this sosoba location . i will not recommend this to any of my family , coworkers , neighbors or friends . just disappointing .
asian	i will never ever take out or eat there again , the people are friendly but the food is terrible and way overpriced
asian	$ 22 for some funky kalbi chicken . overpriced menu . btw , if you bring in a groupon , they expect you to order 1 dish per person dinning . cheapest item on the menu is $ 10 ( i believe it 's chow mein noodles ) . save yourself the trouble with the groupon and just go to the greenland market food court . better food and better prices .
asian	bad food and bad service - food not fresh - not cooked properly - servers were rude
asian	i had the barbecued pork and it was tough , burned , and had lots of fat . the waitress was really slow .
asian	i witnessed them microwave my beef and broccoli . the pho was mediocre . horrible waiters who complain about each other in front of patrons about their tips . the monte carlo should shut this place down and replace entirely . never been more disgusted by a vegas restaurant .
asian	i work very close to this place .... so i gave it a try when they first opened . the chicken tasted like fridge and my mouth had the tipical aftertaste of burning salt that cheap food leaves . today , i gave it another try and went for the noodles .... they were horrible ! now i am back in the office and hungry . threw away the meal i bought 15 min ago . i think they have a good concept , but it has been poorly executed . the food is just bad .
asian	toronto has many places to pick from .... avoid this one .. we ordered fish and it was so bad ! ! ! ! the taste was off .. when we mentioned this to the waitress , she said " the owner doesn 't know how to buy good fish " serious ? cheap quality and a money grab for customer .. read the reviews and you will see that this place is not for people that care for good food and customer service . servers run around rushing through the customers waiting for a table and have no customer service .
asian	the lady manager and waitress are horrible ! they don 't smile or greeting their customers ! they don 't give us the regular menu just because we look like don 't read english ! then they charge us 15 % tip ahead because they said us " the tourists " don 't know how to pay for the tip so they did it for us ! i am from usa ! i know how to give a tip ! if u want a decent tip pls give ur customers a good service ! if i can rate a " zero " star i would do it ! don 't come to this place ! u will regret it !
asian	the restaurant itself is modern bland , service was good . tried one of their speciality roll , one bite was enough so i drank my meal they had a very decent red wine . their sake selection was like their food commercial cheap .
asian	cheating in price ( they raised $ 1 per person at check out and forced customers to pay ) . will never come again .
asian	honestly , the sushi even smelled bad . super expensive given mediocre quality . i live in the neighborhood , have eaten there several times . always the same ... i give up . avoid ! !
asian	bad service ! it was over filled with smoke from the kitchen which ran customers out . had a hard time getting our order correct . we are sticking with yogis ! ! !
asian	avoid if possible , if not i hope you have better luck than i did .
asian	the sushi quality was bad aswell . they put too much rice to get you full faster and they put an automatic 10 % tip . terrible and never coming back
asian	bad service . we were hoping for more from a place on don mills . at first the maitre d shook his head to the person behind the counter to not let us in since we had kids ( not in the least badly behaved ) and when he noticed i saw that they let us in . when we ate the food was low on flavor . do not recommend .
asian	would never go back . they should take a lesson from neighbouring clubs on how to run bottle service and treat your guests . the owners need better management running this place .
asian	ramen station had it ready , but their delivery service eat street just didn 't pick it up for delivery . had to call both the restaurant and eat street to get this done after 1.5 hours . food arrived cold , so you know they used the original food and didnt cook something fresh when they learned eat street 's pick up time . wouldn 't order from them again just based on this . bummer they chose a poor delivery service . even worse they just make bad food .
asian	don 't go . the oil was rancid and the soup lukewarm with rubbery bits with the look of onions . that soup 's ( tom yum ) only taste was of salty stock blessed with a bit of chili oil--something like a consommé of dirty plate . we stopped eating after a few bites . the sour oil left a horrendous coating on the tongue . yuk ! overall , imagine a truck stop where last week 's food goes to be reheated on its way to having a flu named after it . by far , the worst meal i 've ever had in madison .
asian	i have been waiting so long for food never come back again
asian	save throwing food away . took 15 minutes to get someone to wait on us , than waited another 10 minutes for them to make tea ?
asian	if it wasn 't for the the people from out of town in need some hot soup after a long night of gambling . this place would not even make it . i would never come back again .
asian	nothing redeeming about this place . believe me , you ate better off eating at the food court in the mall .
asian	when ordering guy at the counter asked " what do you want " with an attitude like i was disrupting him or something . id like a better fu * king attitude and for the correct order next time , ming . place is garbage .
asian	food is bad ; drink is acceptable ...... go there only because they open til midnight .
asian	received a tasteless soon tofu soup . staff refused to bring it back to kitchen to add more seasoning . disappointing experience .
asian	bad food poor service and the waiters can 't speak well not coming back
asian	one of the worst service and staff i met in toronto . stay away from this below average food experience and the sickness feeling after the food has digested . plus it 's a very noisy place ( by the staff not the guests ) which doesn 't make this any better .
asian	bad food quality and taste though potions are ok but not recommended ... we ordered the food thrice the taste was deteriorating every time ... had a bad stomach after that ...
asian	bad food ， roach ， i saw them in the floor ， i couldnot think the kitch is ， omg ， we eat the roach ， donnot go there to eat the roach ！
asian	super slow service . everyone today was upset at the slow service . only 1 server . not a god choice . lady walked in and started yelling . she ordered food 45 mins ago . not ready . some customers waited and finally took a takeout . food tasted horrible .
asian	the pork is rotted , we ask the server about it but the answer is they force us to finish all the rotted food , because it 's all you can eat and we are wasting the food . and , most of the food are frozen not fresh , you feel it in your mouth . not recommend and not going back , in any stores in their chain . bad experienced .
asian	the worst i ever had ! even though it 's a buffet so you can choose your food , everything was dry and gross . food looks and tastes like it 's from yesterday .. or a week ago . cheap for a reason , big mistake .
asian	bad food , too much msg , you saw that a one penny in my food , there is no next time
asian	we couldn 't find one entre we liked . we actually accidentally slight " over ate " since we kept trying different things , even though only a small portion but it crept up to be more than we planned .
asian	when i complained that the food tasted off and was served soggy , i was told to pay for it or they would call the police . the nexy day i had terrible stomach cramps . only eat here if you want to get sick and are masochistic enough to want service befitting fast food .
asian	cheap prices . descent crab puffs , eggrolls , sesame chicken , and monk vegetables ( could do without the almonds )
asian	finally , i asked the sushi chef if we were supposed to seat ourselves and he said to go ahead . we walked into the other side of the dining room and it was full of patrons and dirty dishes - there was no where to sit . they cleared a table just as we were about to leave . we ordered an appetizer and it was tasty . entrees were bland and the service was horrible . we probably will not be back .
asian	chinese cuisine at its worst . bad , harsh and unpleasant service on top of everything . the bubble tea was the only " okay " thing . at least it wasn 't expensive . never again .
asian	thick meat that was really fatty and near impossible for me to eat . soup had no flavor and seemed like just msg water ... did i mention the layer of fat / grease on top ? service is always fine though they are slow with the water refills , but that 's pretty standard for asian restaurants . very disappointed overall .
asian	bad handler thumb in soup sauce plate put on top of the food poor chief make ugly dishes not worth and harm your health eating there 31 $ no worth at all .
asian	you 'd have to get their attention for service . waiters kept walking and coughing near my table . pho was very bland . i am vietnamese , i can tell when a bowl of pho is good or bad . the cashier girls just throw your change on the table , no thank you / come again , whatsoever . outdated decor .
asian	i brought a house fried rice as lunch today . the lady told me the fried rice has chicken and shrimp , but in the fried rice there was pork in it . i 'm not allergic to pork so i 'm good with that . but the problem is the pork tasted a bit weird . my stomach feels really bad and i had a diarrhea . i thought it is just because my stomach is sensitive . however , my boyfriend had the leftover for dinner . he got a diarrhea too . the meat is not clean and they used tons of soy sauce to cover the taste ! !
asian	i can not begin to explain how bad it has become . i have been coming for over 5 years and i went last night after a long time . the menu has changed and not for the good . the smoothies tasted like water mix with ice and a drop of flavoured syrup . this used to be my favorite tea place . the place is still very classy and the new renovation is definitely very nice but the food quality has gone down soooo badly which makes me very sad . i used to love going here with my family but will never go back again and now will have to look for a new place .
asian	tried hibachi grill supreme buffet tonight . i was sucked in by the 2 sided full page color ad . over 250 items plus sushi and hibachi . some of it looked too bad to try and all the things i tried ( including snails , octopus , frog legs , sushi rolls and hibachi ) were awful . the only good things were the salty shrimp and my glass of coke . note to self - never eat any buffet again . i think it was all radioactive products that japan is dumping on america .
asian	i have been a long time fan of this restaurant for decades . unfortunately , tonight is the first night in their new location east of decarie and with new owners who have taken something good and screwed it up ! food is terrible , customer service is terrible . no joke , i threw it in the garbage . prices have gone up , allergies not considered , and whatever there was tasted like pure salt . too make things worse , much less meat than usual in the same dish size . do yourself a favour , save your money , save your disappointment and choose another restaurant . so sad but the unfortunate truth ! !
asian	i 'm sorry , but it 's just bad . the prices they charge for this lackluster food and inept service are completely laughable . it 's not even that it 's so inedible , it 's just that there are much better places in pittsburgh to eat thai food and although this is the only thai restaurant in the general dormont area , if you 're willing to be a little flexible then there is much better asian food to be had around there . i can 't really think of any good reason to come here .
asian	it is just bad . the menu has like 200 items . they ran out of almost everything . the staffs don 't even know how to make the drink . it took them forever looking back and forth the menu before randomly make something . after making it , they didn 't even know the name of the drink . bad . really bad .
asian	i ate here with 2 other people and not a single one of us liked what we ate . the manager that took our order was rude and not friendly at all . i over heard a conversation he had with a customer and he was so ' matter of fact ' and not considerate at all . we left the wok box saying ' well , we found a place we will never go to again . ' bad service , bad food , and bad vibes . not a fan ...
asian	just bad . 90 minutes to deliver 2 miles away . greasy flavorless food that i paid way too much for .
asian	just bad . the place was dirty , the food was disgusting , and the sushi looked like a biohazard .
asian	i 'm not the sort to panic in crowds , but i was really uncomfortable with tao 's serpentine passageways being packed to the gills . once we got near dance floor , we couldn 't even step onto it . getting a drink was out of the question , too as the bar was totally swamped . oh , and we had to pay cover which was a first . so in sum ... i 'm not a fan of tao nightclub , although i 'd try the restaurant or tao beach .
asian	limited choices of vegetables at salad bar at lunch . quality of vegetables are average at best . they charge you extra each time through for their cold dry chicken and other toppings .
asian	one guy seemed to be the only waiter , the host , and the cashier . we left after not having our order taken for 20 minutes ( not even a drink order ) and being ignored when we tried to flag the guy down . it 's too bad , because the place was clean , the decor is great , and we were looking forward to using the brand new grills in the tables . hopefully they figure things out , and i 'll give them another chance in a few months .
asian	they advertise a special for 10.00 but when we got there they told us they weren 't honoring that deal any more because too many people showed up ! ! ummm not my problem . instead of offering an apology for the wasted gas and time , they rudely just said no more . don 't bother going here .
asian	the server girl.the short one.handle the soup bowls.thumb in side the bowl.not under liner.it makes the whole meal feel bad . we do not want suck your thumb .
asian	nice people . bad food . so bad we couldn 't even finish it and we are huge vietnamese food fans . yelpers beware . don 't know why this place has four stars but it 's bad . like you might get sick bad . i didn 't feel very good for a few days after and i only ate a couple bites . the ingredients are incredibly low quality and it tastes bad .
asian	no flavor . order spicy , no flavor what so every . won 't be back . they were too busy arguing with another customer to wait on me . called order in for takeout , but gave no sauce , napkins or cookies in bag .
asian	not even going to compare to yin ji in guangzhou , it can 't even get a passing grade for standard rice rolls . the rice roll wrapping is soo soft that as you pick it up with chopsticks , the roll just breaks entirely . there is no chew whatsoever ; i was practically just eating rice mush and separate pieces of meat and shrimp . you can 't call it a rice roll if you can 't eat it as a roll . the pork liver congee was prepared bad as well . i 've never eaten pork liver cut into cubes and chunks instead of thin slices . the texture just isn 't right . this place is all hype .
asian	the restaurant was 1 / 3 full . not busy at all . we ordered 1st round , the sashimi came to us 1 / 2 hr later after we finished other food . when we ordered the 2nd round , we were waiting for 45 minutes ! after i talked to the waitress , our food were brought to us one by one . they missed a lot of our orders . it seems like there was only one person works in the kitchen . they cannot handle the capacity of even 1 / 3 of the restaurant . bad sashimi - my husband ate many sashimi , he had a stomachache and throw up at mid night . never come back to this place !
asian	hadn 't gone in a couple years but omg it has gone downhill. spend $ 5 more and go to mandarin if you want to hit a chinese buffet . everyone in our party of nine was feeling ill later and vowed never to go back .
asian	pass on this place ... only 10 tables anyway .
asian	really awful taste . it was too salty and doesn 't taste like any thai i had before . i am not exaggerating . i am not a picky person . i had so much thai food in my life so i know what is good what is bad . i lived in the us for 8 yrs so i know what americanized thai food taste like . i had been to thailand twice so i know what real thai food is . this is extremely disappointing . however , manager and waiter have good attitude and cancelled my food order even i wanted to pay . good service , bad chef ?
asian	a really really bad canto imitation of pho . closer to a clear beef broth soup . iced coffee was weaker than mcdonalds . like a quarter of the amount of ground coffee in a standard viet coffee . at least they have wifi for me to write this review .
asian	they give you such a small portion not worth what you 're paying for . dim sum doesn 't taste as authentic as the restaurants in chinatown . this restaurant just looks pretty but other than that the food isn 't good at all .
asian	bad place ... the guy don 't want to write the orders he said he has good memory , next all our order was totally wrong ... fun part the person was not even apologetic ... please don 't go to these place
asian	it 's not just the quality of the ingredients , but also the cooking methods . when you taste the chicken and say is this actually cooked enough that is enough to say this place is horrible . i do not say this from just one experience i say this from a couple and everytime i ask the same question .
asian	i ordered a red curry beef and the beef was awful , hard , i tried to chew it for a minute and decided to give up .
asian	not authentic whatsoever . much better options around that do not come from a corporate chain trying to capitalize on the poke trend . the place seems clean and the ingredients justify 2.5 stars save your money and go down the street to poke express
asian	as yeesus would say . tried this place out recently . i tried an eel roll . i cant remember the name of it but it was tiny , the rice was too sticky , and the roll completely fell apart . the rice was so over cooked it was literally sticking to the chop sticks . couldnt have been much worse if they tried . also tried the miso soup . it tasted like it was based off concentrate . the asahi beer was good . i wish this area could get just one good restaurant .
asian	bad restaurant .... never come again food was very bad ... don 't come here we came from california and owner was so rude
asian	they tried to rob my money . and they will persuade you to order more if they think you did not order enough . the service is ridiculously bad . won 't go back again .
asian	bad dukbokgi . fatty , mostly inedible kalbi . awful service in a relatively empty restaurant . i love korean food and won 't be returning .
asian	a couple years ago this was the go-to place for great chinese food , and as much crab legs as you could fit into your stomach . we went on a weekday , where possibly the dishes had been sitting since lunch . staff was attentive and helpful .
asian	the manager is sort of rude and the servers don 't even give you spoons when serving soups unless you spend 5 minutes waiting for a server to have time to give you one . 10 out of 10 would not recommend .
asian	bad serivce ... waitresses more interested in drinking and talking to their friends and guys picking them up ... do not come to this shit place ... period
asian	no water served ! ask to wait when we ask for a cup of water .
asian	the servers also limit my group and i on how much items we can order at a time and we paid for the ayce that 's not cool . the grill also always burns up so quickly not like other all you eat places . they don 't even offer to put oil on you have to ask . the quality of meat is also subpar . my advice go to a different place for all you can eat . my favorite is honey pig .
asian	as soon as i walked in i noticed there were flies flying around throughout the restaurant . our waitress got our orders wrong ! and then when i couldn 't finish the bad sushi she told me i had to eat it ! ! are you kidding ? ! i am not about to be force fed bad sushi ! ! anyway , bad service , bad food , and they weren 't very clean . never going there again .
asian	the pad thai noodles we ordered had lots of burned small parts from the cooking pot , and the dessert was filled with black bananas . mum had a diarrhea after this horrible lunch . highly not recommended ! ! !
asian	never going back . also the wasabi is really strong so go easy on it and the vegetarian tempura roll was really weird tasting . it wasn 't crunchy at all . it was mushy and bland .
asian	i 'm a local and this place is going down hill . i 'll be going to the kobe sushi chain only for happy hour , as they never disappoint ! : )
asian	the place is over priced . service was rude and slow . their general tso 's should be called private tso 's ! absolutely the worst i ever had the displeasure of tasting . my companion ordered a beef dish which had only a few smidgens of beef and were chewy and fatty . my son described his food as yucky . it was chicken and broccoli and had an odd smell.we asked to see a manager and was rudely told he wasn 't available . avoid this place at all costs .
asian	when we first walked in we noticed the place was very run down and dirty . the seat had rips all over it , the floor was dirty , the grill in the middle of the table had food crusted on the sides . not sure why we stayed but the forgot to bring us soup , they dripped raw chicken juice in our kimchi , and the food just was not good .
asian	bad service and manager very very unprofessional named nichole wei i have seen her yelling at cashier in front of customers i will nt shop here no more nor i will not recommend ppl to work at this place
asian	if you gave less tips because it was bad service they actually yell at you . food is not good quality and if you are not a regular they will ignore you .
asian	bad service and nothing special about it .. compared to other sam woo branch seriously , this branch doesn 't really serve a good food .. not a good value .. don 't waste your time and money here , especially if you 're familiar with sam woo bbq restaurants .
asian	the server beng is so rude . i wouldn 't recommend this place . there are other good pho around the same area .
asian	extra 7 $ charge for extra large size ! and wrong dish ! they have poor english also
asian	we ordered sushi platters and uni / amaebi / ikura . feel sick afterward . very disappointed .
asian	we are 8 people group , try to order more after first round , they won 't let us do it , because we didn 't finish the gills . and they slow down serving us more meat , till they said we are out of time ! ! ! there is first time we feel not enough for all you can eat ! won 't come back again ! !
asian	puts our table of 12 by the back room where the staff goes in and out every 3 to 4 mins making one of my family members move her chair every time they go in and out ! worse dim sum experience ever . food was just alright for the price and service you get .
asian	we sat at the sushi bar and none of the sushi chefs never even recognized us for whole 2 hrs we were there . after paying 500 some dollars for sashimi plates and lobster sashimi ( it supposed to be their specialty ) , all we got was a bad stomachache . we will not go back .
asian	bad food . all bad . walked in and were basically ignored . food was poor quality . not coming back .
asian	stay away . the food is tasteless and the plate of food i had for takeout was 90 % rice and not good . i don 't understand other reviews on this restaurant . the original restaurant on steeles ave is excellent . this restuarant appears to be a really bad franchise and is nothing like the original .
asian	every single thing we ordered , apart from the xlb , was below average . we had notified server that the chicken was too way too fatty and dry on the inside - she said that was normal and it 's supposed to be like that ... very interesting response lol . not sure why this place is popular .. there are way better restaurants who serve better xlb with better menu items .
asian	hot noodle soup with no ac. a bowl of noodle soup with only few meat and 2 thin slices of veg .
asian	my waiter got my order wrong then insisted on making me a new order for the mistake . as i was walking to car the box felt lite so i decided to see what was inside and these guys couldn 't even give me rice . just chicken . couldn 't get my order correct the first time then can 't give me rice with my food ? rice must cost as much as gold i guess . never coming back .
asian	waited 20 minutes for a table and they weren 't even busy ! the sushi tasted like wet cardboard probably because we had to wait another 40 minutes for our order to arrive . there was a hair in the shrimp sauce that was so nasty ! just steer clear of this place , unless you want bad service and bad food ! ! ! yuck ! !
asian	save yourself the money and drive 5 mins east to the markham / bur oak one , at least that one won 't give you diarrhea !
asian	bought the food from the cashier . thought i can sit down to eat . but it 's a to go order so they said no you can 't sit down to eat even though the restaurant is empty . sub-standard service .
asian	bad service .. called to place a delivery and i called the wrong location .. they gave me the phone number for the closes store nearest me .. only they said it so fast that no one could possibly remember .. i ask for it again and they hung up on me .. what a jerk
asian	came earlier today and waited 15 minites and still nobody came to see us . decided to leave ! disappointed
asian	can 't accommodate patrons and filled to-go orders before dine-ins . must have lost our ticket amid the confusion after over 30 minutes we received our appetizers . fried crab wontons were dripping in grease and soupy on the inside . soup was good , but received a dirty spoon . the rama noodles were not as good as previous visits . we have never left a restaurant with out tipping ever , this was our first time . until they can staff the restaurant better and handle their patrons we will not be returning .
asian	unfortunately , had to seek an other restaurant to try . don 't waste your time or money here !
asian	dirty dinning room . food tasted okay . i would not go back !
asian	and this is not the first time that this has happened . last time my dad and i waited for almost an hour and even though we complained they don 't give a fuck . there 's so many other great places to get korean food . seriously not worth the money and the time
asian	bad service .. food isn 't that good , never coming back - do not recommend .
asian	food was just ok , better chinese food elsewhere . check out yueh tung ( not sure of spelling ) at corner of elizabeth and dundas 2nd floor and order the chili chicken on rice . or try swatow on spadina ave. about 2 blocks away . the only reason people go there is because it has modern decor , if you 're into the ikea look .
asian	forgot about my roll completely , then lied about it . when i finally got my roll the fish smelled fishy . would not recommend .
asian	she seems lazy . she didn 't clean the table or ask if we need box , even if the restaurant wasn 't busy . very disappointing !
asian	the host , was the only one that should be working here . he was very nice . the ladies pushing the carts should be fired . they stand around and talk to each other . they get mad if you wave them over for food . customer service is very foreign to them . food is cafeteria / food court quality . you could buy the frozen dim sum at the store and it would taste the same .
asian	greasy , flavorless dishes . not worth your dime even if the lunch special is under $ 10 . ordered chow fun beef noodles and the chicken cashew dish . i doubt if i had ordered something else it would have been better . never coming back .
asian	bad service , had died fly on the food and i call them to see and they just take it away and act like nothing happen
asian	the food was about a 6 out of 10 . good but definitely not great . the thing that grossed me out was the bugs ! they were everywhere . i even noticed fly strips hanging in the kitchen ( i peeked through a window ) and that just really grossed me out .
asian	this place gets overcrowded during long weekends . i went for a lunch buffet , had to wait 30 mins for naan . if they want to serve lots of people during holidays they should increase their staff to provide a better service . food is average , very limited options considering the price they are charging . only advantage they have is very few indian places in town .
asian	bad service , horrible attitude , day old food , didn 't refill water machine , weak foam plates that bend when food is on it , plastic utensils .
asian	i have been to different ayce sushi restaurants for many times . this is the worst experience i have ever had . my friend and i went to this place for the first time last night . we are two girls and were not feeling full at all when we " finished " our dinner . yes , our dinner was finished by the rude server . won 't be back because of the service .
asian	andwhen i told her she blame it on me told me that she repeated our order and we agreed . but she speaks so fast we couldn 't understand her . but its ok dont want to return or change order cuz they speak their language they might do something on my order and guest what when i got home and check my phad thai she really screwed my order . she gave me chicken phad thai lmao . unreal . will never go back here again its our 1st time here will go back to komol restaurant in sahara commercial center .
asian	bad service ... i placed a order they gave it to a bigger party .... the manager said sorry .... i order once more from them so it happen again .....
asian	i waled in alone and no one came by to take my order for 15min . i asked the server 3 times to take my order and they pretty ignored me . and gave full attention to the table next me who were a bigger party with more orders . i really do not appreciate this place and im not coming back for sure .
asian	i was seated by their receptionist . she handed me a menu , then she said your server will be right with you . the place were nearly empty . maybe 3 tables were filled with 4 person each . the two waiters were just standing around , doing what they do best ... nothing ! ! ! ! i sat for 10 minutes , no one came to serve me . never again ! ! ! ! i do not recommend to eat here when you visit las vegas . go elsewhere if you are craving for filipino food .
asian	i was told about a new happy hour deal that includes a pbr and ramen bowl for $ 8 . i said i didn 't want a beer , the server said that 's fine and then charged me $ 13 for my ramen bowl . basically paying people to order beer in order to get a savings on your meal is very irresponsible and wasteful cause next time i guess i have to order the beer and not drink it or pay a $ 5 penalty . genius marketing guys . it 's a wonder there was a total of 3 people here .
asian	i won 't return again. people there have some weird ass attitude . i dont like fake nice people . i accidentally knocked over some stuff , and the waiter told me nice job . what kind of service is this ?
asian	i would rate zero star if possible . they didn 't serve us because we were waiting for friends coming . extremely bad service . don 't go there if you are in a group
asian	they made us tip for 4 people on the check for horrific service . never again will i go here . why did it have 4 stars . such a lie
asian	takes forever to wave down a server , even when it wasn 't busy . the broth is either too tasteless or too overpowering , there is no happy medium . after a while the broth starts to taste burnt and has a burning odor . the dinner prices is $ 35 per person , which doesn 't seem worth it to me considering the service and mediocre food . something in the food gave my girlfriend an allergic reaction . probably won 't come again .
asian	most of the waitress never smile. food got to the wrong table and no apologies . i have found hair abd some black threads in the food . seafood are fresh . the servers are unwelcoming
asian	servers walk like turtles . do not eat here . u will rather take taxi to china town for better food .
asian	a lot of conditions on paying . food was too spicy , the rice pudding and butter chicken with rice were the two ok things . buffet is $ 10 a person . brought a friend had a voucher which does not state cannot be used at lunch so very confusing as other vouchers do . not a modern atmosphere i prefer but they tried their best with keeping clean at least the food presentation area . i will give someone else the voucher with details , my friend and i do not intend to revisit .
asian	didn 't worth the drive . interior was too fancy , so was dish . i 'd give b for food , c for place , d for service . the waiter was plain rude .
asian	bad service ok sushi expensive price for not that great of an experience or meal will not return and urge others to go to other restaurants and avoid this one
asian	ordered online 45min prior to driving to place and they had no clue about my order and forgot to put it in ! bad costumer service ! decided on just canceling order !
asian	order to go perking duck but can not find sauce and onion in the package .
asian	i ordered a duck and pasta , it just came with 3 pieces of duck and a bit of pasta . terrible not satisfying , i do not recommend this restaurant
asian	after finish eating , go to the front and paid w my credit card didn 't put tips on card bcuz i already put cash tips on the table .... and the cashier ask if we put tips on the table ? weird ! ! ! who the hell would ask that question ? never go back again !
asian	party of 5 , brought us to a table with 3 chairs and just walked off . we had to solicit chairs from other tables ourselves . they just don 't give a damn . the women pushing the carts won 't tell you what they have unless you ask . some try to force you to take the last of whatever they have . it 's stressful . taste of the food is all over the place . mostly it 's average . not a good way to spend a sunday .
asian	never coming back and the quality of meat is not even worth it compared to their price ! ! !
asian	recently i 've been to spoon house a couple of times , however , i 'm very very disappointed today because the person they hire is very very rude . she literally exhibits impatience and left without me finishing my sentence . she just walked away ! they can do a much better job by hiring someone with a little bit more courtesy and patience .
asian	we were the first guests in the restaurant , and after an hour or waiting for sushi / sashimi , the waitress told us they hadn 't even started our order ! when did ' sushi making ' start takin so long ? ? ? we told them to cancel our order and bounced . don 't even know what the food quality is like but i can 't wait an hour to find out . there are better japanese restaurants in henderson if you 're willing to drive out of the hotel .
asian	the food was second rate , poor quality sushi stuffed in a seaweed and rice wrap the flavor of the seaweed was nonexistent , i like seaweed and this was the same flavor as my napkin . we had three or their rolls and they were all mediocre . will not be going back .
asian	food was meh we ordered mongolian beef and salmon . kids ordered lo mein they liked it but it was very small portion .
asian	rude wait staff . took wrong order and didn 't even refill water or follow up and 15 % gratuity is automatically added to the bill . definitely wont come back . food was average at best . but asian food in vegas so we didn 't expect much
asian	the assorted meat noodle tastes like a half effort version of tom yum .
asian	server also was short and abrupt and didn 't take time to listen to our complaint .
asian	the manager or owner does not exist . please avoid this horrible restaurant . the servers listening skills are 0 , they will bring you something different than what you initially your order and will not minus the wrong item from your check .
asian	serving food slowly for a 2 hours limit buffer . still hungry after the buffet . added a 15 % tips mandatorily without asking our feeling .
asian	short stocky asian waitress gave my wife a death glare . my whole table was shocked by the bad service . pho was also just as cold as the service .
asian	i can 't even explain why it would take this long . same old menu so the tea was good.after they had made the correct size ..... come on man
asian	the whole family looks angry all the time . they don 't even bother talking to you if you ask them something . they also won 't let you choose which duck or pork that you want . they just give you whatever they want . this place is also very expensive .
asian	went with a party if 4 and they already included gratuity in the check so we had to pay for the terrible service . contemplated on getting my own water
asian	taking plates with food off of the table while we were still eating . sticky rice that wasn 't sticky and chicken fried entirely too long . terrible experience
asian	i 'm saying this as a person who love ramen and have gone to a lot of ramen places . avoid this place !
asian	the sea food dish had a bad smell . prices above average
asian	don 't even care about customers . i always ordered from them when i came this town.today was bad experience . i am not going to order any more . sucks service
asian	very interesting if it were just me wouldn 't i just sit by myself in the table ! ! ! ! !
asian	the server did not smile at all . food isn 't great . the fish was not fresh at all . overpriced for the portion . teharu is definitely better .
asian	the servers started complaining about the tip . it was not just the waitress but also the floor manager that started the argument . it 's for the customer to decide how much to tip . this is how you chase your customers away . last time i went to this place .
asian	bad service , the waitresses were rude and ignored us. the food was decent although the sushi did seem a bit unfresh and warm ( sushi is typically cold ) .
asian	bad service the waitress hardly speaks english the wait is long the table were not cleaned from the dirty dishes at all.the food was ok but way over priced .
asian	they got our order wrong and when we asked to fix it , the sushi chief sounded annoyed and was saying something in his language . another customer came up to us and translated that that the chief was saying that if we annoy him anymore he will kill us or spit in our food . never never eat there .
asian	they kicked us off the table cause the got busy . what the ! sane happened to the party next to us . apart from that food was ok . waiter told the party next is that they ordered to much ... lol why can 't they order all they want ?
asian	they need better management to help customers . the lady took my order was very kind . when the delivery was supposed to arrive an hour late the driver did not know my address i asked him what was my address on the paper he said my correct address but still did not know where i lived ? ! it 's the little things they keep people coming back i will not call the store if i was starving in the desert
asian	they were slow to give my order even though they were only a few customers that time . also i spotted a few homeless guys just outside sitting . not only that , the place isn 't all that neat . find a spots of dirt on the floor . if it weren 't a request of my niece then i wouldn 't have gone here .
asian	we waited 15 minutes after we sat down .... they ignored us so we left . also no air conditioning . very humid ... and the place reeked of fish . will never go back .
asian	bad service - waited 30 minutes for the appetizers - had to ask multiple times for water
asian	an went to cancel it and the waiter had an attitude . had to keep asking several times for silverware and also got attitude for that as well . won 't be coming back .
asian	ps . she wouldn 't take my groupon because i checked in with yelp and got a free drink .
asian	not quality food at all . ordered a mongolian beef dish ... it was more like mongolian onion . all onion no beef , over priced in general and you certainly don 't get what you paid for .
asian	waitress was rude and impatience . bad food ... looks nothing like the picture on the menu . never coming here again
asian	before anyone came out the back to help us . teriyaki sat to long in rice and was nasty
asian	was told that they were closing their kitchen at 1 even though they were open till 2 . therefore , they said we had to order everything now at 12 : 50 . i just don 't understand why the store says there open til two but stop serving food an hour before they close . maybe the employees lied or is that really a thing ? not coming back
asian	water took 20mins and if i didnt go to the cashier to ask for water , we wont be getting water . and its cash only ! food was bad . wasnt even that busy , servers acted like it was !
asian	we accidentally spilled a glass of water and the server stared at us with a fierce glance . he wiped off the water with our napkins and when we said thank you , he said " my pleasure " in a sarcastic tone . when we asked another server for more napkins , he only gave us two when there were three of us . unbelievable service on valentine 's day . food is okay .
asian	bad taste - no taste , very bland , pricey for what you get . this stretch of spring mountain road has plenty of other viet restaurants , but ' pho kim long ' probably has the most intersting name . i guess that 's how they get the most votes to be # 1 .
