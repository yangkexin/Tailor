mexican	well priced , properly portioned for tapas , and great service . i recommend the ceviche and the chorizo . both were excellent !
mexican	the meat is awesome and grilled perfectly every time . you can dress it up with whatever you want with how much ever you want . i put a ton of stuff on it and throw it down . i don 't care if the restaurant is dumpy . i don 't care if the single file line is out the door . i don 't care if they only take cash . i get a perfect burger and decent fries and it is all worth it .
mexican	they use beef tenderloin that is tender juicy and over the top delicious . tortillias made on site . friendly quick service always consistent . superior management that runs a well oiled machine . absolutely the only place in the valley for fajita ! !
mexican	the best mexican restaurant in town . you can walk out feeling more than satisfied for less than 30 , and that includes a nice tip for two people . the chips and salsa are excellent and every meal i have had has been outstanding . always consistent , never disappoints . frank and lupes is on my list of top ten places i take friends from out of town who want a great meal .
mexican	always a nice atmosphere and service , too . we literally drive about 20 minutes out of our way just to go here when we get a hankering for fajitas . i 've had friends order other dishes and it looked pretty run-of-the-mill and they were not particularly impressed . i would give it 5 stars on fajitas and 3 on the other stuff , so 4 averaged .
mexican	great service and fun music . enjoyed the mixed platter of ceviche and some st simon oysters . although i was clearly the oldest person there , i felt very at home . i recommend if you are in the neighbourhood . : )
mexican	my group agreed it was a " soft " 4 out of 5 . things were generally good and i thouht it was an improvement from valdez . the best part of the meal was the duck confit rice ( delicious ! ) , branzino was tasty but we recommend to debone it yourself because the server didnt debone the best . the mussels were unfortunatwly undercooked . we ordered the hamachi ceviche which was good . tamales were a bit bready but cocktails were good . service was very attentive . overall a fun place for a group meal but a hit of miss depending on what you order .
mexican	i had about 7 tapas and all of them were really tasty . it is hard to choose if you don 't know the names of the dishes but we had food and surprise in one . if you want to get to barcelona without any travel time , this is the place that will give you the vibe .
mexican	when in season the pomegranate guacamole is second to none . a refreshing escape from the cookie cutter chain restaurants . when you go go with friends and don 't have a schedule as the wait can be long , but worth it .
mexican	the tableside guacamole is to die for with the addition of dried cranberries . menu selection was very different from regular mexican restaurants and a welcome surprise .
mexican	chef silvana salcido esparza travels to mexico for many of her ingredients and you can tell - things are always fresh ( they only have an ice cream freezer ! ) , creative and authentic . i am more than content w / a mango margarita , the incredible guacamole and the gooey caramel filled churros ! ! even when the restaurant is packed , the staff is friendly and informative .
mexican	we had not been to the original barrio in 10 + years , so decided to stop in again for their amazing enchiladas suizas ... they were just as good as i remembered too . i enjoyed a hibiscus agua fresca with my lunch and they even gave me a to go cup when leaving . quaint dining room , great service and seriously amazing food !
mexican	from the very beginning it 's evident that chef silvana knows her stuff . the creativity of the menu and the superb execution of the recipes is just the beginning of a wonderful taste experience . the wait staff as well as the hostess were friendly , helpful and sincere in their appreciation of our business . barrio is not close to where i live but i am certain i will go back ... over and over and over again .
mexican	the consistency is amazing . my fav is the pato en tamarindo seared duck breast finished with a striking sweet and sour , tamarind chipotle reduction . she is a little over priced but very good .
mexican	i was a little apprehensive about throwing a surprise birthday party there . we showed up , announced i needed seating for eight at 6 : 30 ... and was seated about 90 seconds later . what do you say about the food ? not sure how it could improve . best guac ( i hate guacamole ) on the planet . my foodie guests were delighted . we will be back .
mexican	the drinks were excellent and our server , miranda , was informative and helpful with suggestions . my friend and i went with the tasting menu , and each item was as delightful as the next . i will certainly return !
mexican	i love that they have rotating specials , so there is always something different to try . their guac is the best around , and i love that they give you such a large portion , rather than just a tiny scoop . it 's almost a meal in itself . you can 't beat the price for the tacos , even when it 's not happy hour - the chorizo is a favorite and most recently that they had a bay scallop taco that was absolutely delicious . i 've enjoyed the margs before but they also have a terrific beer list . you really can 't go wrong here !
mexican	i had gone to the locations downtown and in treemont multiple times , and was excited to try the new one in cleveland heights . similar to the treemont location , the cleveland heights barrio has delicious food and drinks with a great casual atmosphere . barrio is known for their incredible happy hour during which margaritas and tacos are $ 3 and $ 1 , respectively . if you are near cleveland heights , make sure to check out this location .
mexican	it 's also a must to go back more than once , as you need 3 or 4 trips to really try all of the different options . i 'm all about mixing and matching so this place is a dream come true . ingredients seem high quality and fresh . their different guacs are all worth a try too . i 've also tried 2 of their signature cocktails , which i can 't remember the name now , they 're on the expensive side but definitely unique enough to be worth it .
mexican	when i tell you i am addicted i mean it . tacos are amazing and so are their margaritas . i go at least once a week . if you are not a patient person you better get here early . you are going to be waiting for at least 15-30 minutes . but in my opinion it is so worth it . only downfall for me is the fact that their patio is not big at all but the restaurant has a day of the dead type theme which i love .
mexican	it was a bit pricey compared to most mexican restaurants , but the quality is very high so it is worth it . i just got a burrito and i was impressed and the quality of ingredients inside . i love the environment as well . the chips and salsa were also delicious . the portions are big . the server was very friendly .
mexican	i have lived in the south west for decades . i know and have eaten at many mexican restaurants . this is my favorite in phoenix . we ordered the coshinita pibil and the mango salad . wow ! as a side note , barrio has an incredible amount of tequila . the restaurant serves wonderful margaritas .
mexican	hands down the best tacos i 've ever had , and the guacamole is pretty incredible too . i 've been here at least ten times and i 've never had even a single bad experience . the staff are friendly , the food is great , what more can you ask for ?
mexican	i go with my co-workers , husband and bring out of town guests . the atmosphere is perfect ! ! casual yet trendy , hoppin but not too loud and the perfect prices for quick , fresh and delicious food . and now that it 's warming up , whew is it beautiful ? ? barrio has these beautiful garage doors that completely slide into the ceiling to expose diners to the sunshine in the front of the restaurant . and they have an outdoor patio : ) the tacos are spectacular , cocktails are made with fresh ingredients and the beer options are crafty and endless . i love barrio and since its opening in cleveland heights my life has improved by 80 % ; )
mexican	i also had their truck come to my wedding for late night food . everyone was impressed , especially out of towners that got to experience just one of our local gems .
mexican	my go to is always the el jefe taco . probably the single best taco i 've ever enjoyed . actually craving some barrio right about now ....
mexican	they have great food , great atmosphere , and great drinks . i would recommend coming here if you are looking to eat some yummy tacos .
mexican	don 't let the address or neighborhood fool you . there is no meal like this in scottsdale . this is a no hype , all taste achievement experience for your senses . if barrios can find a way to maintain what they have accomplished and open a few more of these around town , that would be delightful . if expansion takes away anything from this masterpiece , then leave it just like it is .
mexican	a friend suggested this place while we were visiting . it was packed for a thursday night . my gosh . the margaritas are amazing . went down like water ( but lets be honest , when dont they ? ! ) it 's a build your own taco deal . they give you a paper and you check off all these super yummy and unique things to build your taco . they are massive tacos , could hardly finish 2 of them . the place itself is super cute . right by progressive field . the patio is the perfect people watching spot !
mexican	with $ 3 margaritas and $ 1 off tacos , you can eat and drink like royalty on a low budget . they also are an extremely inventive group of people , introducing new and exciting dips , drinks and tacos each month . at the tremont location , one particular bartender makes the world 's best margaritas with unique flavor profiles that even his coworkers don 't know his recipes . i wish i could tell you the flavor but i can describe it as sweet with a bit of sour and potentially melony , but i could be way off .
mexican	no matter what location you go to usually a nightmare to get a table . with that being said the menu is delicious the food quality is great everything is so good staff is usually pretty awesome and they also have a lot of suggestions for different kinds of tacos . also they have amazing salsas and guacamole !
mexican	every location is great , every meal is great , 98 % of the staff is amazing . mackin at this location is always there with a smile , as are every other server , hostess , and bartender . the prices can 't be beat and neither can the selection . if you screw up a taco it 's because you 're being overzealous . there isn 't a bad thing on the menu .
mexican	many different choices in meets , different types of beans , rice , salsa , build your own tacos with guacamole and various toppings . i was very impressed with the set-up and spread , and the food was very tasty . a little on the spicy side , but not too spicy . tons of flavor . it made us visit the restaurant where the table side guacamole with pomegranate seeds is a must-have . the food is not really for people who don 't do spicy , just fyi .
mexican	the ambience , service , mexican food and house margaritas are all are deserving of 5 stars . when the chef comes out to greet you and check if you are satisfied , you are definitely experiencing something unique . this restaurant lives by their motto , a toda madre ! going back tomorrow to sample another flavor infused dish .
mexican	i recommend the arizona burrito or the choose your 3 tacos . great spot for both large parties and small groups . the location makes it an easy spot to get to and i appreciate the parking lot in the back to help with old town parking !
mexican	victor , the bartender , always knows just what to make and had the most welcoming personality . he 's consistently the reason i kept coming back !
mexican	the food at lunch was fantastic . the street tacos are fresh and flavorful . everything is cooked to order - even the tortillas . the service is fun and friendly . there are two sections to the restaurant - casual and a bit upscale . try one side one day and the other section the next . absolutely up to the standards of barrio cafe .
mexican	i love it . i have had almost everything on the menu and there isn 't one thing on there that you should shy away from . i will often order the michelada and am never disappointed . the wait staff is lovely and inviting and the vibe can be buzzy if you hit dt gilbert at the wrong time . i suggest coming with the intention of having some drinks , a few appetizers and a delicious meal !
mexican	when i went , it was my first visit and i wasn 't sure what i wanted to try . i asked the waitress--her name was emily---to surprise me . she brought me three excellent tacos ( street tacos style ) . i can 't remember which she brought but they were so good , i had her surprise me with three more ! the food and service is excellent here !
mexican	great margaritas , great food ! great tacos and burritos . daniel the server is a real g .
mexican	my family and i ate there the other day . we had great service and loved the decor inside . since we liked it so much i had them cater a training that i was facilitating and again their food tasted amazing . we had enchiladas and a taco bar . i am looking forward to our next outing there and having them cater for us again .
mexican	i love the pasole and the michalada 's . we always ask for sherrie as our server because she is extremely knowledgable of the menu items and she is always happy and energetic ... plus she is so funny ! ! ! our favorite bartender is victor . he 's awesome ! great food , great atmosphere , and great service .
mexican	it 's harder to retain quality in a restaurant probably 5 times larger than their original location but barrio pulls it off . the food is expertly prepared with lots of very fresh ingredients . if you have a few days in the scottsdale old town neighborhood , barrio queen should be on your short list .
mexican	first - adorable set up they have going on in old town . can 't believe this was my first time coming here ! had really great service so no complaints there ! and the chips and salsa were on point . in addition , you can 't beat their deal of 3 tacos for $ 10 ! however , in my opinion , i 've had better tacos ! i thought they were good , but they lacked something for me . i will be back to try the different ones they offer because some of their unique ones scared me off .
mexican	i feel ... like every other place that i gave 5 stars should be knocked down a star . this is what real 5 stars is . i don 't know what i liked better : the service , my enchiladas , my margaritas , or my churros . i 'm totally serious . i loved this place . holy hell . could you imagine if this place was closer to me ? i 'd be broke as a joke and obese . i loved this place . i don 't know what else to say about that .
mexican	our server , stefanie , was so pleasurable ! ! makes all the difference in any restaurant visit ! ! omg .... making up your own taco is the best idea , plus it was so much fun ! natalie , jason & mark were on the food line , preparing our food and did an excellent job ! the rosa salsa is awesome , the cilantro lime suace ..... there 's a vast list of choices of salsas , cheeses , suaces , not to mention the choices of meats , poultry & fish ! if you enjoy a taco , this restaurant is a must ! the ambiance is delightful . # satisfiedcustomer p.s. try pickled veggies . yummy !
mexican	you have to find the perfect taco creation order . once you do be sure to take a picture of your order and keep it saved to your phone so you can remember to order it 's perfected recipe next time . their margs are awesome , their beers are cheap and their service is always on point . i personally prefer the atmosphere of this barrio location in tremont , but i do enjoy all the location 's tacos . also don 't forget to split the guac & queso for the table . it 's well worth it ! barrio is bae . ' nuff said .
mexican	when one vanquishes the fear of the unknown you will leave the sins of your past behind . the shrimp here is delicious as well !
mexican	hands down , the best . i always get a different dish every time i go and i have yet to be disappointed . if you go , definitely request doug as your server . he is very friendly , helpful and got us our food very quickly . i have been very pleased with my experience at this restaurant so far and would recommend it to anyone that is looking for an excellent , authentic mexican food cuisine . the ambience of the yard is awesome and provides for a fun and exciting atmosphere . after dinner at barrio make your way into the yard for a night of games . definitely the place to be on a saturday night .
mexican	had lunch there ( today is their day 3 ! ) with two colleagues who had each made new years resolutions to try new foods . we all loved our lunches ! the atmosphere is funky and welcoming . the menu is chef-driven and different from any other mexican restaurant in the valley . the food is fresh , colorful , creative ( who can resist " breakfast ' til 3 ? ! ! ) and -- most of all -- delicious . are you still reading this ? ? you should be on your way there already ! ! ! ! ! enjoy !
mexican	we came in for happy hour the other day and sat at the bar to enjoy a few snacks . i tried the hibiscus margarita and it was delicious , not too sour with the perfect topping of hibiscus to balance it out . we also split a green chili dip that had slow roasted melt in your mouth pork and a couple of the quesadillas . everything really good and our bartender was friendly . we will definitely be back to try the 25 + tacos they serve ! did i mention the ridiculous happy hour ? it goes from 7am-6pm ( $ 5 apps , margs and 1 / 2 off tequila , tacos , apps ) ..
mexican	i love the choice of build your own taco or pre-made tacos . i opted for two build your own tacos , one had pulled pork and the other was the pescato ( fish ) option in a hard + soft taco shell ( highly recommend ) . the lime aioli was amazing on both my tacos . you also get unlimited chips and salsa ! visiting from out of town , i 'm glad we got to see one of cleveland 's top places for tacos .
mexican	the salsa was very tasty , as was the queso and guacamole we tried . everyone designed their own tacos and they were all a huge hit . our server was more than patient with our numerous questions . a great dining experience !
mexican	i cannot ever get enough of their queso and salsa , it is amazing . the build your own taco concept is fabulous and i have been to all of their locations bust must say , kuddos to the downtown cleveland location ! you never let me down with your timely service , attention to the accuracy of my orders , succulent and mouth watering margaritas and an experience that always leaves me wanting to come back . if you want mexican , get here now .
mexican	this place is good ... real real good . tried a variety of their tacos , their braised beef tostado with a fried egg which was my favorite and their homemade guac . yum yum yum . also tried their seasonal pineapple margarita also very tasty . restraunt has a nice atmosphere and service was great . definitely a must try . can 't wait to go back , sorry barrio not sorry .
mexican	i love this place . not like the one in downtown , reminds me of metro-chipotle . my favorite thing ever is the cheesy corn . after that , the tostadas con todo , arepas , empanadas colombianas , and the strawberry soda . try any of the dishes with their special homemade sauces . i always end up taking leftovers home .
mexican	i have been here many , many times and my food is always delicious . i 've always had good service , and never had to wait longer than 10 minutes for a table and you can byob . the cheesy corn is amazing , the ropa veija is mind blowing and the steak maduros are what dreams are made of . i 'm happy to see a small , family owned restaurant do so well , so even those the prices have gone up i 'll keep coming here .
mexican	they serve half price sangria until 6 : 30pm and it turns out to be only $ 12.50 the wine are half price too on wednesdays . i had the octopus and it was very tasty and flavourful . the pincho was very flavourful . the clams and the sauce was tasty too . i came here twice this week ! will be back for more drinks and tapas !
mexican	the tacos were creative , non-traditional , and yummy ! interesting tequila infusions . cute spot tucked away in strip mall heaven by southpark mall . great patio !
mexican	been to spain twice and this compares ! great prices and delicious red sangria . go there now !
mexican	after " high end " dining all over toronto , we decided to go local . we happened upon this gem . teeny so .. be prepared to mush in but worth it ! drinks creative and relish . chips ( always ) the barometer and definer between " eeh and great " were .. great ! salsa great ! not at all stuffy ! crowd local and chill . manager could smile a bit more but the rest of the team was terrific ! a wonderful neighborhood eatery . everyone that came in was greeted with name recognition or a smile and wave . vegetarian dish was flavorful and abundant . tacos great too ! reservations a must ! ! happy chip-n-dipping !
mexican	bartender hooked it up ... was hesitant about coming here but had a very good time ....
mexican	go check them out when your on your way out of town .
mexican	food was great ! the bean dip was a nice touch ! friendly staff
mexican	4 later , i 'm keeping this review short ! really though , this place is great and the food is amazing . if you have an appetite you can do a small plates / " all you can eat " option to try more things .
mexican	friendly , fast , and great at making margaritas ! they also know a lot about beer in case you have any questions . the food is also very , very good . not traditional mexican . very creative menu with lots of vegetarian options .
mexican	i didn 't eat last time but love the conchita pibil ... they have everything come in from the commissary so i 'll update in a few .... they make sangria on site
mexican	heather was better . but service is pretty spotty . the ceviche was great , and for $ 9 is one of the better values . the huge side of roasted beets for $ 5 was also great . the carrots - not so much ... bland , etc . only 1 bathroom downtstairs . bathrooms upstairs are bigger and pretty cool . both upstairs & downstairs bars are cool , more intimate downstairs . the menu is really pretty pricey . same menu as richardson 's / dick 's hideaway , and they serve both menus at rokerij , which a lot of people don 't realize .
mexican	bartender suggested the margaritas for us and was spot on , she called the sunny siesta for me and the loubiton for my salty seniorita girlfriend / wife i give this a 5 star call purely on drinkability nothing to do with the cuisine ! ! !
mexican	i had a mango margarita , spicy queso , and 2 street tacos . so good ! ! ! !
mexican	hope i spell it right haha . fajita salad was bomb bomb . found myself wishing for more steak on it . ceviche was also bomb bomb . lots of chips , small bowl of ceviche . absolutely will return . great groupon deal ! thank ya nacho daddy cant wait to further explore the menu . i would like to try the nachos for sure next time and bbq burrito sounds oh you know ; d bomb bomb !
mexican	my spicy margarita was perfect ! fish tacos were cute and rolled up and delicious ! will definitely be back with more friends ! thank you blue agave !
mexican	highly recommend if you 're nearby , and have a desire for mexican food .
mexican	first of all i have no idea why some people would be discouraged because it 's connected to a days inn because it 's basically it 's own little mexican place with cute outside seating too . the prices are great and portions are too ! we split the large combo and added a taco to it and everything was awesome ! we are huge mexican fans and will be back ! !
mexican	my food isn 't even out yet and i 'm a happy girl . fresh quality taste . service is great although my mom and i are the only people here . i will definitely be updating after i eat my quesadilla . yummy yum
mexican	i tried half green and half red sauce . i 'd recommend the green , very tasty ! my husband enjoyed the quesadilla but didn 't prefer the taste of the # 10 . all the ingredients were quality and the service was friendly . we will be back .
mexican	my date had chicken fajitas and i had a cobb salad - both verv good . the margaritas were excellent . they were half-price , but i would have paid full price . we shall return for more .
mexican	value pricing and delivery ahead of schedule . service was awesome and their rep helped setup the venue after he arrived . the food was delicious , and we still get queries from our clients asking who we had cater our event . really killer salsa ( and i 'm a salsa snob ) combined with tasty dishes made for a successful event . whether it 's a casual dinner out for yourself , or if you need catering for large groups , you can 't go wrong with blue agave . do yourself a favor and stop in or order their catering today ! ! !
mexican	the other two in the car said 4 . so i wish 4.5 stars was a choice ... tostada , bean burrito , fish taco , and 3 meat combo platter all excellent . the beans were a little runny which i like but 2 people thought was strange . came here because of d3 ( diners , dine ins and dives ) and glad we did ! be prepared to wait a moment to order , and another for the meal to be ready . and do everyone a favor and wait to order before securing a table ... otherwise you are just being annoying .
mexican	very casual atmosphere , but friendly staff that accommodated our short time frame . chips and salsa were tasty and meals were excellent . my husband had a burrito special and i ordered a la carte , 1 spinach enchilada and 1 chile rellenos ... both were great . if we lived close by , we 'd be eat here often !
mexican	i figured anything better than salmonella or the need for a tetanus shot was a win . wow was i pleasantly surprised . now i have been there maybe ten times and it has been fantastic every time . great food , great price , huge portions , and they are fast and friendly . i have had a few different items and nothing has disappointed . if you are not on the burrito shack bandwagon you are missing out !
mexican	omg was it delicious ! those 3 tacos ( coffee something ) were amazing . their drinks are great too .
mexican	thought the decor was super funky and fun . my meal was delicious , as was the hubbys . maybe our bodies were just starved for something that wasnt deep fried eaten at 5 a.m. , who knows . i ordered the carne asada tacos and my husband had the chicken burrito . everything tasted so fresh and yummy . chips were very good , prices were good ... i would definitely go here again .
mexican	but , i 'm adventurous so i 'll try it anyway how bad could it be . service : above average cleanliness : perfect ( new place so expected ) devour : combo appetizer ( pica ( shredded beef ) nachos , chicken quesadilla , chicken taquitos ) , enchiladas combo and a single pescado taco quality : first off the salsa is delish . it has a texture and about a medium spice . the combo platter was huge , everything was great . the best thing that stood out was the taco . by far the best fish taco i 've had in a very long time . i 'm getting a fish taco combo next visit . i will definitely return .
mexican	i had the huevos divorciados ... i was definitely not disappointed ! the only reason why they didn 't get full marks was not because of the back-in-the-day décor , but because the back-in-the-day décor needs a bit of varnish . : ) had to give the heads up ... who cares ... i love this place and will definitely be back ! cheers ! p.s. when you leave you don 't feel overfull , but you do feel satisfied . amazing !
mexican	some oddities : i asked about subbing out my rice and beans and was told no . my wife ordered two a la carte tacos and was told the plate ( with beans and rice ) was the same amount . the chips and salsa were very good . service was brisk and attentive . the audio system had a great music mix including frank ocean and digable planets .
mexican	frank is such a nice guy and the food was great ! my wife had the beef enchiladas with ground beef and a fried egg that was cooked perfectly ! ! i had the fish tacos and they were amazing other than the tortilla falling apart ( recommend two tortillas ) the beans and rice were good ! ! the hot sauce was just the way i like it ! ! everything was great and glad we came in ! ! looking forward to trying the chili verde burrito next time we are in ! ! by the way the chips are made in house and everything is fresh and made to order ! ! pretty hot and tasty ! !
mexican	i expected the service to be slow and the food to be tasteless . i was very pleasantly surprised . our food took about 10 minutes to come . this was my first experience with venezuelan food , so i asked the server would he 'd recommend . based on that i ordered a a chicken and a beef arepa w / black beans and rice . the beef was more flavorful than the chicken . two people under $ 20 , i 'll go back . i liked the fact that it was quiet in there .
mexican	i had three street tacos , two barbacoa and one al pastor . i preferred the barbacoa , but both were flavorful . also , i asked for extra cilantro and onion , and they readily agreed . no problems . my guy had a carne asada breakfast burrito which he said was good but a little on the dry side . we loved the byob feature and picked up a couple drinks at the liquor store next door . overall , if i 'm on that side of town , i 'd visit again .
mexican	the restaurant is small and unassuming . however , the woman working behind the counter was charming and helpful . based on her recommendation , i ordered the green chili shredded beef fry bread . with the beans , lettuce , tomatoes , and cheese on top , the fry bread was almost enough for two people . i was keeping the spice level low so i used the mild red salsa . the whole combination was delicious . i switched between the fry bread and the chips as a vehicle for the meat , beans , etc . i couldn 't finish it , but it was so good , i wish i could have !
mexican	we went for dinner though and the main course is broken down into a selection of the " do it yourself " tacittos or the " assembled " dishes ... i selected the lamb which was very good . would have liked to try some of the tacittos , but the table was quite small and didnt think i would be able to pull it off . we did go on a saturday night though , and the place was quite busy ... definitely will book ahead next time ! the restuarant has a pretty cool decor and really friendly / knowledgeable staff as well . overall this was a great place and would definitely go again !
mexican	" it 's not somewhere you 'll be excited to go . but it 's a good place to eat a healthier fast food lunch . it would be cooler if they took a gamble and made it into genuine mexican flavor chipotle but it almost tastes exactly the same . which is not a bad thing , everybody likes chipotle . nice decor . looks clean .
mexican	don 't be too sketched out by the area ; it adds to the authenticity ! i would recommend the chicken chimi or a basic bean and cheese burrito . awards cover the walls of this place and you know it 's good ! be sure to grab a dozen tortillas to go or some salsa by the pint .
mexican	only complaint is the salsa is very mild , but if you ask them for some hot sauce they will give you some really spicy stuff . mix it in with the salsa and it tastes much much better . i like the chicken fajitas as an entree .
mexican	basically fancy chi chis , momocho is still somehow better ? i prefer bomba or barrio just because they update their menus more often then el c. margaritas here are awesome and it 's super cool inside , would be good for large parties .
mexican	basically just wanted to drop a line saying that getting a pork belly taco and a house margarita might be the most delicious $ 7 you can spend in the roosevelt area .
mexican	hands down , best guacamole in town . get it with everything in it - including the pomegranate seeds . the low rider margarita is awesome . also , their signature pork dish is pretty tasty .
mexican	the reason why is because of the nice customer service , the ease of reading the menu , and the authentic mexican / latin dishes . i love this place , it 's very cheap and definitely worth every penny . the drinks of one of the best tasting . sangrias are my favorite !
mexican	the gobernator ( not sure about the spelling ) was delish ! beware of the hot sauce ...... it 's really , really hot .
mexican	taco tantos has a very hipster atmosphere and serves multiple craft beers . the burritos are awesome and you can tell they use fresh , natural ingredients . beware that the el biggo size is ridiculously big . i can never finish an el biggo so i go with the regulata . my favorite burrito is the black bean with guacamole .
mexican	i don 't taste much of a difference from many other mexican restaurants i 've been too but it was good !
mexican	by and far these were the best tacos et-cetera that i 've had in madison . it 's possible there is still some hidden mexican gem somewhere in madison but there is definitely nothing on par with los gemelos in the downtown vicinity .
mexican	bean burros and tortas were particularly tasty - fresh ingredients - priced fairly and served quickly .
mexican	the beef taco with minced onions was savory and the chicken tacos were good . the food is a-ok and their care about responsible sourcing and food issues kicks the experience up a notch . we found the truck at the peoria sports complex on friday night . one of the great things about yaya 's is how kid friendly they are . depending on where you find them the kids don 't need to sit still and there a lots of kid friendly food options .
mexican	nothing fancy or gourmet . fast friendly and cheap . good music
mexican	very similar to moes . for the price , it 's worth a visit though ! the staff is very polite , quick , and helpful for new comers . the sauce bar is a nice added touch too .
mexican	they have a great little salsa bar with pickled onions and cabbage . tacos and burritos made to order and from the look inside the building it looks very clean which is important to me .
mexican	service is good . food is inexpensive . i am a regular . see more info in my review of pedro 's .
mexican	the meat tasted great , and included avocado and pico de gallo . beans were good and even the rice was above average . i 'll definitely visit again . small strip mall location , but very clean and reasonably priced .
mexican	great atmosphere with the large woodwork and standing tables . it was a perfect destination to try some new things and some old favorites . everything was spot on with their elevated pintxos . nice cocktail selection too .
mexican	can 't lose with chipotle ! another great burrito bowl ! the rice was undercooked and a lil crunchy for a few bites . but idgaf bc they loaded my shit was juicy chicken and all the workers were nice .
mexican	fries are delicious . they offer a variety of salsas and toppings . only thing i will complain about is that i wish i had some chips to eat with my beans and rice . other than that i wish we had one of these in texas !
mexican	the cod fish appetizer was really tasty and the churrasco misto was great ! i got a side of black beans and didn 't regret it at all . also , the steak was a perfect medium rare . and give the brazilian soda a try , it 's fantastic ! the service was also fantastic ! the owner is a feisty brazilian woman who is all bubbles and happiness . the servers were on their game and service was fast . the backyard patio is also great . it has a nice spacious atmosphere . this was a great addition to larchmere ! i will definitely be back !
mexican	my wife and i went the last two saturdays--because it is that good . the food is fresh and full of flavor . the atmosphere is nice and cozy with outside seating in the front and back . the staff is friendly , and i was always waited on when needed . this weekend the owner came around to check on us . for a new restaurant , it is run very well . the drinks are good . the appetizers are good . the prices are very reasonable . i write very few yelp reviews , but i felt like i had to write something quickly because this new restaurant is amazing . it 's easily one of my favorites in all of cleveland .
mexican	we got the mango salsa and chips , it was yummy and we might try a new flavor next time . we got a medium bag of chips which had wayyy too many chips for how much salsa we had . wish they had some other sides to choose from .
mexican	don 't let the location or the exterior dissuade you from entering this hidden gem , you will not be disappointed .
mexican	bbq jackfruit tacos with coke slaw is a great pairing
mexican	the honey wasabi is amazing .. the queso is excellent , the tortillas are home made and perfection .. i wish we had one in raleigh !
mexican	the salsa is amazing and pretty much everything i have tried , is great !
mexican	i got mahi two ways- one bbq , one blackened . the bbq was incredible ! ! ! ! ! ! i didn 't love the pasta salad side .
mexican	this places never fails . great burritos , great service . went in today and the manager was there . he bought lunch for my family and i as a thanks you for coming in . way to show hospitality and generosity ! i will continue to return . and if you 've never been here , get the barbacoa
mexican	chocolate shake is delicious , thick & rich . prices are reasonable . burgers like this would be twice as much where i live . paradise valley , you 're spoiled ! and this place is clean , especially the bathrooms . very impressive for a strip-mall burger joint ! !
mexican	yum ! also don 't overlook the side items like i did and miss out on the yucca or plantains . kid friendly with highchairs . oh and it 's all about the sauces .
mexican	ok-now that you know how obsessed i 've become with this delicious creation-i can tell you about all the other things i love . cochata ! holy crap ! as someone who already loves horchata , i nearly lost my mind when i had this combination of horchata and coffee. i can get two of my fixes in a single drink and it tastes amazing. i 'm also a huge fan of their carne asada burritos , the meat has an incredible flavor and is really tender. the america 's corn is also a favorite of mine ; the flavors of the cotija cheese , lime , and chili go perfectly with the corn. and they have mexican coke ! how great is this place ?
mexican	nothing more i can say than an absolutely phenomenal mexican food joint with incredible history and delicious food .
mexican	sauces are tasty too . good place for fast mexican food .
mexican	reminds me of my tia 's beans in mexico : - ) . their al pastor tacos with pineapple are perfect ... mmmm , mmmm ! i 've been to the 7th st , chandler and old town scottsdale locations ... all are consistent , friendly , good service ... always great food ! what more can you ask for ?
mexican	total deliciousness ! ! ! chips and hot sauce are very tasty ! super clean place and everyone is very friendly ! i mostly eat alone and it 's always a great experience ! ! i go often and will continue to ...
mexican	a little expensive but worth it . guacamole was awesome very sweet . the food was fast and really delicious , and the food presentation was nice . they even put the sour cream and guacamole in little bowls made out of chips . our server was friendly and very helpful , making sure our meal was enjoyable . to end the meal we ordered the fried ice , which was amazing . i will definitely be coming back again .
mexican	food was great ! all around good experience . salsa has a different taste , not hot but almost a sweet and spicy combo . service was good but we did feel a little rushed on our saturday lunch . would definitely recommend .
mexican	server forgot the sour cream that i ordered on the side . with that being said , i ordered the arriba pollo con queso , and let me tell you what , it was delightful . the chicken was tender , juicy , and it was topped with a delicious jalapeño cream cheese . arriba mexican grill has trully achieved something many restaurants stride to obtain , but few ever attain .
mexican	definitely a great , quick spot worth trying for out of towners like myself .
mexican	and boyyyyyyy these were good ! now there is not whole lot of vegan here , but who cares ! those beans ! ! ! ! ! ! the plantains were bomb and their hot sauce is to die for ! now i 'm all about garlic but unfortunately theirs is more like an oil chutney . i drained off the oil and ate the garlic . if you could eat beans and rice everyday 3x a day ... go here and get them beans ! ! ! ! they have a lot of love in them . owner is very sweet ! check out my pics !
mexican	salsa and chip bar is refreshing . carne asada meat is moist and flavorful
mexican	prior to this visit i had only had tortillas from here and now that i came to eat i 'm questioning myself why it took me so long to come try it out . will be back
mexican	quality of food for price is outstanding . support your local mom and pop and eat here !
mexican	" beans are money " just opened yesterday , the new el portal is nestled inside the walter cronkite building of jounalism in the downtown asu campus. food is as awesome as the location down on grant. more of a quick service atmosphere. gonna make this my go to mexican joint because its well within walking distance .
mexican	i don 't care where you go ... the carne asada is less fatty & the beans are the best ! ! ! ! ! mmmmm mmmmm
mexican	the chiwas taco and the pastor tacos were my favorite . not the absolute best tacos in phoenix , but they were good and worth a try .
mexican	the street corn and the crab rangoon nachos are amazing . very friendly staff and great atmosphere .
mexican	takeout or sitdown . everyone is extremely friendly ! the food is always made so quickly . i love that this location is here . i always eat at the downtown location for lunch and then i can eat at the banksville location for dinner ! you can 't order a bad thing off the menu - it 's all good .
mexican	beast burrito | crispy fish tacos | $ 2 taco tuesday 's | great location | cool atmosphere | great staff # centralphoenix # upwardprojects
mexican	roberto 's ain 't got nothing on this place . order late night though , they have the best customer service and food . whoever the cooks are at that time , the food is delicious ! we always oder the bean and cheese / rice burrito , carne asada fries
mexican	i love their atmosphere and chips and salsa too ! i am a forever customer . i 've been coming here for years and will continue !
mexican	beat mexican food in vegas fresh made right in front of you cheap and avocado sauce is the best i got al pastor tacos and the carne asada sope both were so good fast service only complaint is it gets very packed and they don 't have enough space to sit and eat
mexican	beat place ever they have to die for carne asada crispy fries and the best orange blood margarita in las vegas .... i will be going back alot
mexican	nice , hidden away . mexican comfort food . great food when ya just wanna eat cause your hungry food . nothing fancy , but yummy good . started out slow with the three item combo plate for $ 7.50 . how good could it be ? ? it was delightful . got the chili relleno , taco and tamale . just like mama would have made if she was a little mexican lady . the young man that served us was very polite and our food arrived in a timely manner . now let 's talk margaritas ..... these are no wimpy margaritas . these will put hair on your chest . we will be back and we are bringing relatives . great find .
mexican	the tortillas are made fresh- which makes a huge difference in the flavor . i 've never had a bad experience at any of their locations . so glad we decided to give it a try . definitely have become a regular . p.s.- that creamy cilantro dressing is so good- my husband and i have to get extra sides of it ... which anything we order ... try it : )
mexican	we are first timers here . wasnt sure how to order but the friendly staff and owner was there to make sure everything went smooth . just 5 days open and the crew did an a + job ! ordered 4 jaburritos . and all of them were delicious ! they have a few different pre-selected menu items but if you want to create your own they have that option too . definitely going to eat here again !
mexican	order form the counter in the back and they 'll bring it all out for you - i like the sweet potato taco trio with chips , salsa , guacamole and a mcauslan oatmeal stout , personally . the service can be a little slow but the staff are so friendly and community oriented it 's never bothered me to chill in line at the counter and chat with them while i wait . there is free wifi but it 's been super spotty in my experience . this is a concordia haven so don 't be surprised by the young crowd or the oh so earnest student art on the walls .
mexican	jazz music is playing in the background , and there is also live jazz music on sundays ! food is delicious and very unique . waiters and waitresses were also very nice and professional . the bar area is also really nice , and a great place to go to with friends . the brussel sprout appetizer is to die for . the tapas ( small appetizers ) are also great . i got the margarita flatbread , acaraje tapa , and the sliders . all were amazing and cooked to perfection !
mexican	i love the dark wood everywhere that fits well with the entire aria look and feel . the food and presentation was great . i love tapas because you get a small portion and many plates . the most memorable dishes was the flat iron steak , chicken and mushrooms and the churro with spicy chocolate . yum ! our waiter was extremely accommodating and comped our dessert . the manager even offered to have my girls and i to come back and have a round of drinks comped . sold ! = d
mexican	great customer service and wait staff . have lived in vegas 3 years and have not found - until today - a place that could make a chili verde that i actually loved . today i found that place and its panchos . anyone complaining of price have obviously never been to a high quality mexican restaurant as panchos . they 're prices are consistent with other restaurants and yet panchos food is better . i highly recommend and will be bring my husband here for date night ! !
mexican	tapa style dishes make it an appropriate place for both big and small groups . great service but you may want to make a reservation as it is quite busy and you may have to wait in line ! flavourful food ( tacos were amazing especially the pollo con mole ) and you can always add a kick with their in house habanero sauce . great drinks ( cafe patron ) and churros as well !
mexican	we shared the appetizer platter and everything was incredible . offering 3 different salsas with chips ... brilliant . the margarita was delicious and strong . they really knocked it out of the park with the chocolate tamale though .
mexican	our group got a variety of tacos and sides . the salsa trio offered with the chips was very good , very unique tasting . make sure you try each one . the street corn is out of this world . the guac is divine . my only wish is that they 'd offer more vegetarian items so my boyfriend could get something other than the veggie taco . the veggie taco is a nice thought but pretty tasteless and was his only option .
mexican	unique style to this building and a long complex menu . service was perfect ! ! ! and that 's hard to find these days . food & drinks were delicious , although on the pricey side . average cocktail $ 10-12 average meal $ 20-25
mexican	the food was good , but not wonderful . the queso cheese is cold , and that was an unpleasant surprise .
mexican	great service and love the options of different salsa ! ! !
mexican	nice relaxing atmosphere inside . service was good and quick . they serve chips and salsa while you wait for your meal . they were delicious . they give you three different homemade salsas . i loved the green one . i ordered the carne asada tacos . the carne came in a bowl filled with sauce . only thing i didn 't like about it . it was like a stew and hard to pull the meat out to put on the tortilla . tortillas were fresh and prices are reasonable . overall it was a good experience , had a great time and i 'll be back .
mexican	chicken enchiladas were awesome and the portion size was perfect .
mexican	: ) yes , i love their cilantro infused rice as well as the chicken of course . so well marinated and the chicken actually melts away in your mouth . loved this place . it is so simple and easier to stop by anytime of the day and have a full meal like a 1 / 4 chicken with rice and beans , or just the avocado stuffed with quinoa and chicken . these two are my favorites . their sauces are amazing ! ! overall , i wish viva chicken opens up in the nyc metro area as well .
mexican	i love the open layout ... great for the waste management tournament . hole # 15 is by far my favorite ! work on your sand game before you play this course , because every hole except # 1 has sand . i suggest playing right before or right after the tournament so you can get an amazing experience , with the stands up on hole # 16 .
mexican	pinches tacos were very tasty . had the shrimp combo plate along with elote . about the only downside is how they deliver your food . they give you a stand with a number but they kept having issues finding people at tables . none the less , the food was worth it and as the line of people backs up during a nice day i 'm sure they will do well .
mexican	we were early for dinner - they were not yet busy . our service and food were good and we will return on our next visit to the phoenix area .
mexican	the plantains , ropa vieja , and jicama is delicious .
mexican	attentive service . the food is actually good too but the prices are a bit steep for how small the portions are . $ 17 for chicken skewer app , 10 for grits , and $ 16 for small lump crab lettuce cups . everything flavor wise was on point just wish portions justified the price . good if you want small tapas though . and everything fresh .
mexican	we had the fish tacos and the yakitori skewers and , although arent normally the kind to take pictures of food , we felt the beauty had to be captured before we devoured it . everything tasted fresh and light and we would definitely return if we ever find ourselves in phoenix again .
mexican	we were there for brunch , a group of vegans and two omnivores . everyone was exited be the food options ! we tried vegan cheese , garden balls , and guacamole for appetizer . everything was amazing . we also tried nopales ( cactus ) salad and la isla ( yuka , beans , tortillas , and pineapple salsa ) for the entree . everything was delicious
mexican	the service was also excellent ! would definitely recommend le cave as a place to eat in las vegas .
mexican	the manager was super nice they stayed open later for our group since we got there late after coming from a kindergarten graduation ceremony that ran way longer than we thought . the manager gave all the kids coins just throw into the fountain . was little disappointed that they didn 't have horchata maybe there an out for the day ? i don 't know maybe but i feel like mexican restaurants should have it . good had very good flavor and came out quick
mexican	added steak to my quesadilla , best skirt steak on a taco in charlotte . usually other taco places lack in flavor or in tenderness when you add steak , but this skirt steak was seasoned ( juicy ) and cooked to perfection . i will be recommending this and making this my new lunch spot
mexican	the menu was small which isn 't always a bad thing . they serve you chips and salsa on the house as soon as you sit down . the salad was actually delicious . didn 't taste like any other salad i 've had before . didn 't try the tacos so cant review on those . i would go again to try the rest of the food . servers were very nice as well .
mexican	great staff ! we ordered a lot and all of our food was correct and tasted great . if you visit or live downtown and like taco bell , it 's worth a visit .
mexican	soft upbeat music . we had the mussels , steak , tapas . so excellent . the ambiance was lovely . i 'll be back
mexican	my girl friend and i felt right at home with eduardo and his lovely team mates . chips and salsa arrive quickly as we decide on a casa margarita and jalapeño margarita . fancy handshaken margaritas for the win . i also try the mexican margarita which is with fresh lime only which i prefer to the jalapeño margarita . my shrimp javier 's chopped salad was yummy ! ! they managed not to overcook the shrimp . my friend loves her crispy taco and enchilada combo . wish we could come back soon ! ! aria has a great variety of spots . this restaurant was happening and we really appreciated the lovely service and spacious booth for 2 female diners .
mexican	i had the pork en mole - tender pork in mild dark mole . it came with black re fried beans , guacamole , and something like a cheese quesadilla that had taken a bath in ranchera sauce . the husband enjoyed ensenada fish tacos . again very fresh ingredients . i also enjoyed a fresh watermelon margarita made with jalapeño infused tequila - sweet , tangy , spicy goodness . service was very friendly and attentive . want to try their brunch , which i 've read is the best in las vegas .
mexican	the margaritas are the best ! they are very tasty and strong ! i had the naughty maggy ( cadillac margarita ) and a mango on the rocks , both so good . to eat , i had the anna 's pollo . it is a chicken dish , i wish i would of taken pictures but it was too good . overall experience was great . good food , good drinks , amazing ambiance ! !
mexican	oxaca and monterey jack enchilada and crispy flour choula chicken taquito served with rice and choice of refried or black beans ... very tasty yu-go selected chili relleno , pork tamale and crispy taco with ground beef ... pleasantly surprised with the quality . the food was more than plentiful and seasond perfectly to our south of the border preference . priced very reasonably and certainly a bargin with a casino restaurant coupon .
mexican	they have the best caldo de res and caldo de pollo ( mexican beef stew and chicken stew ) . just like grandma use to make .
mexican	i love the veggie arepas , fries , black bean soup and maduros . great service , great alternative to the barrio scene . can 't wait to go back !
mexican	i used to dine at the location on sunset but their new location is wonderful ! the staff is great , the food is great ... i 'll definitely be coming back ! : - ) i would recommend this restaurant to all of my friends .
mexican	fun wine flights ( bold reds ) and patio chairs ( try the rockers or the suspended swings ) . beets and scallops were outstanding . flatbread was just okay , but would absolutely eat here again .
mexican	jawaiian jerk chicken was so flavorful ; the plantains were unique - sweet and great texture . wish i had room for the ahi tacos ... they sounded amazing .
mexican	i had heard about this place a few times and decided to finally check it out . i 'm glad i did . i ordered the fish tacos followed by some pork belly and they were both excellent . it 's definitely worth checking out and highly recommended .
mexican	their tacos are on point ! want to go back an try some of their other items on the menu
mexican	food is colorful and healthy . not pricy . will visit again if get the chance .
mexican	everything i tried was great : white ceviche , croquetas , marinated olives , pintxo chorizos , beef and cheese . got a pitcher of red sangría . the waiter seaid it would get us ~ 5 glasses but it was a lot more than that . my favorite : pintxo chirizos : i 've been looking for this kind of spanish chorizo for a long time ! the chocolate cake dessert was also great . got my two long favorites , so i have to give 5-stars . : )
mexican	they have a wide variety of margaritas that are all worth trying . i have been there twice this past week and loved it all , the tacos are amazing and the sweet potato chicken tortilla soup is outstanding . fun spot and i 'm glad z 'tejas built this is in phx .
mexican	we came up here because of how well they do down in old town , food is spot on , and service is great . kudos to the owners and management !
mexican	i am a old employee of julian and im proud to say that . this restaurant is awesome , and julian serrano is awesome . its casual so if your used to picasso you may not like it ... so set your expectations
mexican	food is really good too . i don 't consider it strictly " mexican " restaurant - they do a lot of experimenting with seafood etc . i really like their crab tacos and salmon entrees with a little latino twist ; ) the entrees run on the expensive side for their size , and so i 'm giving them like a 4.5 stars .
mexican	great food . great service . what more could you ask for . i read a review below that said the portions were small . um ... not sure how much that person eats but there was definitely no issue with portion size at this restaurant . i had the fajitas ... they were fantastic ! we also did the table side guacamole , and of course this was after the complimentary chips and salsa you get first . and they give you two types of salsa , one medium , one mild . for dessert , the flan ! everything was fantastic !
mexican	beautiful restaurant , incredible food , nice people who work there
mexican	the menu is extensive with plenty of choices of authentic mexican fare . i ordered the casa margarita and wow ! it was so tasty ! even my mother who rarely ever drinks ordered one after trying mine . service was friendly and prompt . i totally get why this place gets so packed with people !
mexican	the restaurant is open and has authentic paintings , fixtures and furniture . most importantly the food is phenomenal ! i am a regular at the manhattan beach panchos and the new panchos in las vegas is beyond belief ! excellent food and service in an authentic , beautiful atmosphere ! the bar offers top quality cocktails and wine and the bartenders are professional and experienced . just what vegas needed !
mexican	fantastic seafood paella that serves 2-3 , tender and tasty schnitzel and trout . great looking desserts . too full this time to try .
mexican	delicious margaritas by the pitcher for a reasonable price . free chips with three house made salsas that are great . i ordered the enchiladas with red and green sauce - very good . my friend ordered a dish with the white sauce which was amazing ! service was a little spotty .
mexican	w were lucky enough to get a window table . the service was definitely 5 star . very happy friendly and super efficient . we had a house margarita and enjoyed the extremely spicy salsa with chips . just like we like it . the food was very good although for we who love spicy the shredded beef was a bit flat which was easily remedied by the addition of the great salsa . we would definitely return when in the area .
mexican	we sat outside and had the tableside guacamole . delicious , even the chips were great . i had the steak which was delicious . my husband had the scallops . he said it was by far the best preparation of scallops he had ever had .
mexican	you can see the kitchen and chef at work also , which is a bonus compared to traditional mexican joints . make sure to ask about happy hour and margarita monday
mexican	excel any service , delicious food . chips and salsa delicious !
mexican	my visit to patria was nothing but delightful . my companion and i shared a small veg paella and a few other vegetarian tapas . the food was cooked expertly and was a treat to enjoy after a hard week . the servers were knowledgeable and suggested a great wine to be paired with the food and in our price range . this is definitely a chic , upscale date spot for anyone who loves spanish cuisine .
mexican	had drinks , ceviche and guacamole , and fried ice cream for dessert . all very tasty .
mexican	the service was fantastic , the food was amazing and i had the pleasure of meeting chef chris santos who was very friendly and welcoming . our waitress erin was so helpful and attentive to my gluten allergy . one of the owners adam , checked on us as well . cannot wait to come back !
mexican	the food was amazing . some standout dishes were the burrata toast , chicken meatballs , and the pork belly . the cocktails cost $ 17 which is average for a nice place in vegas . ordering was difficult since the waitress told us to order 2-3 small plates per person at the table and it was way too much food . very difficult ordering with a group of 7 people . cost came out to about $ 75 per person which was fair for the food we received . the best thing about this place is the ambience of the entire restaurant and pawn shop as you enter .
mexican	even though it 's really good - lots of well-seasoned meat , guacamole , sour cream and shredded cheese on top of a generous serving of fries - you will probably not be able to finish it . the serving is that humongous ; it can feed three people . this small eatery offers lots of combinations and items at low prices . definitely no fancy atmosphere , but lots of choices and generous servings of good food at low prices make this place a winner ,
mexican	i had the mirgas which was mexican rice , beans , scrambled eggs with sausage , salsa , sour cream and nacho chips ... very filling and not too pricy for brunch ... will come back and check this place out again .
mexican	my sister & i had to take our lunch to go since there is limited seating in shade . we prefer to eat our hot food in cool places ; i would love to enjoy the entire i love arepas experience by eating outside after sundown . we each ordered the number 7 and empanada con frijoles negros y queso . the number 7 was my first choice as i 've seen my fellow yelpers say only good things . i very much enjoyed this # 7 and would order it again ! the green salsa was spicy but the burning sensation was drowned out by my bebida parchita ! ultimately i miss tapatio . he would have enjoyed being eaten with my meal .
mexican	( for good reason though ) . all chipotles use quality ingredients , and have a superior product . in my opinion , this store stands out because of the staff . very friendly and extremely efficient . i use the iphone app ( ya , there 's an app for that ) and order / pay from my office . when you get there you can stroll right up to the counter and simply pick up your bag to-go . nothing to sign , no hassle , and no wait . can 't beat it ! ! don 't stress accuracy of your order either . i 've had zero issues with that .
mexican	i went the other day and waited way too long . try an off hour and you will be fine .
mexican	don 't be fooled by the brick exterior . inside hides a gem . good service and very nice staff . awesome hot dog buffet . it comes with a drink and fries as many refills as you can handle for $ 6 ! ! wow . great al pastor tacos . tender meat a slight crunch of the tortilla and their salsa . yum !
mexican	i went here with another neighbor we enjoyed it . fast service i was able to order a chimichanga the way i like and a chicken quesadilla without the onions parking was easy , it wasn 't loud and it 's centrally located i recommend
mexican	what an excellent idea ! i had the most delicious pomegranate margarita ... i had to have two ! food never seems to be quite as good taking it home , rather than having it at the restaurant . but it 's a pretty good 2nd . we live close by , so this is typically our go to mexican restaurant . one of the best things they have : their tortilla chips . flaky , crunchy and perfect ! i will continue to return !
mexican	it is reasonably priced and tasty . you order at the counter , and then they bring your food to your table . the service is quick . there is plenty of space , and the restaurant is open and clean . they also have a nice salsa bar and soft drink refills . in addition to common soft drinks , they also have mexican-style drinks such as horchata . i particularly enjoy the rice that comes with their combo meals .
mexican	i had a long day & just wanted a quick bite with my nephew , so we dined in & filled up ! i will say this , don 't get the whopperito unless you like spice , i expected more of a burger then burrito
mexican	i can tell you that the employees here have an enthusiasm & exuberance i 'm not used to seeing in a fast-food environment
mexican	this place has an amazing wine and beer list , with detailed descriptions . the menu is varied with options like game dishes , thai food , fish plus a large offering of mexican food . the staff is pleasant and fun . try this place !
mexican	they now accept debit which is great . the meat was fresh , and the portion sizes for the bowl was appropriate . it was delicious . the girls behind the counter exuded excellent customer service . they accommodated my strange request for mostly mild with a little bit of hot sauce . they made my bowl perfect , so perfect that i ordered two more for my siblings . it was delicious . i will be back for sure and will recommend to friends . the only annoying thing is having to pay extra for avocado but that 's a franchise issue . thank you stc chipotle for the change and improvement .
mexican	the food and drinks were really good . our server jane , was super cool and very nice . good times . i had the grilled mahi tacos , my friend had the pick 3 tacos ( she had chicken and steak ) she said they were both very good . the atmosphere is great . we were outside on the upstairs deck , very nice .
mexican	the service was amazing . i got the beef taco plate . the spanish rice was delicious . my bf got the carne asada fries and it was okay . i think it got too soggy with the beans on top . overall , pretty good . 5 stars for service and flavor
mexican	the service was good and the food delicious . between the two of us we had : - fried calamari - pan serrano - potatoes bravas - chicken croquettes - iberico sliders - chorizo with mashed potatoes since it wasn 't busy the food came out really fast . everything was piping hot and we were done within an hour . i had a martini and a couple of glasses of red sangria and the bill was still only $ 75 . we would definitely come back again even if we didn 't hit the happy hour prices .
mexican	made the trip worth coming up for . waiting for band too start . so mucg food
mexican	it 's either this place or another down the street if i 'm deciding to grab mexican to go . they get the food orders right and their quality check before they hand you the bag is a great idea . place is ok with cleanliness and that even goes for the salsa bar where people tend to leave a mess .
mexican	they have a small market and deli full of meats for the go as well ! great local place . an argentinian star in china town .
mexican	just like in mexico . only tip would be to ask for extra salsa !
mexican	lots of flavor and fresh ingredients . i like the idea of trying a local place instead of a chain .
mexican	normally , the one empanada would have been enough for my lunch . however , i have really been wanting to try this place , so i also ordered a chicken arepa and a side of guac . both were just average . arepa probably would have been better if it had more time to cool ( i burned my hands trying to eat it ) and if i hadn 't already scarfed down an empanada . overall , i ate enough for two people and had a soft drink for about $ 12 . not bad . i will be back to try carne asada fries and margaritas .
mexican	southwest finally has a great mexican restaurant . prices were a bit high , but well worth it for the taste . charro beans were good along with the rice . the two starter salsas were very favorable . friday mariachis are a must .
mexican	yum ! ! i ran into mr. cooker at first fridays and was pleasantly surprised by the deliciousness . i had never had venezuelan food before and i was greatly i did . also had the beef empanadas ! biggest empanada i 've ever had . loved mr. cooker & the staff was fun and awesome too !
mexican	both amazing . had to add salt to soup and my garnish was brown and dying . guacamole added bacon and goat cheese ! delicious !
mexican	nice authentic tacos from this gringo . only regret is that i had a jersey mikes sub just before .
mexican	better than garcias across street . only bad thing is last time saw some roaches , pretty gross .
mexican	our fave is the green chile con papas with crispy papas . when ordering ask for the papas to be well done or crispy and they should be a nice crisp consistency if eaten right away . the next best burrito would have to be the california burrito with papas . we 've never really strayed from these two burrito choices , and probably never will , so when it 's time for our favorite burrito fixation we just have to hope it coincides with their odd hours . this place is definitely worthy of a try if you are in the area during their business hours . oh , and have your order with the hot salsa . see ya there !
mexican	totally crave this place and not many others compare . shredded beef taco and chimi special are superior . chips served warm and are light and crispy . yum ! ! ! accented by the best salsas . great food and large portions .
mexican	always excellent food , yummy chips n salsa . awesome margaritas ! the service is always amazing . one of the neighborhood 's best kept secrets.thanks for always taking care of us !
mexican	now i actually have dreams about the green chili ! amazing !
mexican	it 's inexpensive , quick , and delicious not a combo you always get . i particularly enjoy the giant caramba 's burro , granted we generally spit it between three of us , and i also love the giant stuffed quesadilla , again usually shared . also they have great grilled fish tacos . a great family friendly laid back place to grab food and a margarita .
mexican	always good and cheap ! big portions too ! # 10 green with chicken is the best . green tamales are excellent !
mexican	was also happy to see one of the hardest workers from stephanie location working at this one . great food . can 't go wrong with a bacon breakfast burrito .
mexican	i last ate here when they were still across the street from michael 's up the way . it 's nice to see the food hasn 't lost a step and is still a lighter and fresher take on american mexican fare . i miss the free parking , the slightly more cozy atmosphere , the ala carte options , and the more price-friendly counter service of the old place , but i 'm glad the basics are still in place at the new location . hopefully they 'll continue to keep me as a fan for the next 20 years .
mexican	food is great , service can be spotty though . i don 't like that fact that you get small scope of beans and rice in a tiny corn tortilla bowl . i assume they do this because most poeple don 't eat the beans and rice so it is more cost effective not to serve large amounts .
mexican	generally friendly , fast service--including from the owner . of course it 's probably the best " mexican " in town , although the burritos and tacos ( meat ) can be a bit on the saltier side . wonder if they 'll ever get a more appealing sign though ( and not just a flimsy banner ? )
mexican	the help were very nice [ i guess people react to how they are treated ] . 2 $ pacificos in phoenix , got to love it ! ! also a great place to ride your bikes . be seeing you there .
mexican	been a few times awesome environment , great and friendly staff , amazing food .. my favourite iz the classic quesadilla .. salsa bar is amazing !
mexican	also once ordered for ten people once and they delivered to our office . everyone liked it . i like their sopa de tortilla the most . i 've had better 3 leches cake but it still hit the spot . the food is definitely mexican ; none of that tex-mex crap . i always grab some items at their little mexican grocery store upstairs . provecho !
mexican	every trip has been great . service was very helpful and attentive . been with friends and fam , kid had a great time and loved guac . we have made it through every taco and while best is agave chicken all have been good . highly recommend . oh and churros are amazing
mexican	good fresh food and served in a reasonable amount of time . items on menu that are not obvious to a non spanish speaking individual are listed in english which is nice . i personally enjoy mexican food , but do not enjoy having to eat out with a translator .
mexican	appetizers have been consistent the entire time . prime rib has been consistently good . drinks have always been cold . service for us is always great , we almost always sit at the bar n the entire staff are great . 1st time here i would suggest . happy hour margaritas or kiltlifter large alambre camarones pork carnitas mexican shrimp cocktail ( the acapulco is also very good ) enjoy and say hi if u see me n the wife there . ! !
mexican	doesn 't get better value downtown than $ 7.25 for the small chicken bowl . perfect every time !
mexican	" which made my day , he thanked me and i happily enjoyed my food : )
mexican	never has let me down . fantastic green chili ! best shredded burros around . and the pollo fundito is as great to eat as it is to say. leaps above fast food , eat in , or call it in and pick it up at the drive through .
mexican	nothing better than the chicken green corn tamales with sauce ! !
mexican	i come to this location regularly and compare to other locations it 's seems like the staff here go above and beyond to keep their food fresh and their restaurant clean . they are so friendly and work hard . thank you !
mexican	be it your ground beef , chicken or the sweet one : bananas and chocolate or only chocolate , you 're always delectable ! get 2 for $ 5 for the former and $ 2 for any sweet one ! the man has always been nice ! leave some tip for their delish food and sweet service ! and your day will be so much brighter : )
mexican	doubled up with another couple for dinner and drinks . everything was spot on . wait staff was definitely on their game . bartenders made the best jalapeno cucumber mojitos . food was exceptional . great night all around .
mexican	menu has expanded , in a good way , more great tacos . go to place for lunch or dinner .
mexican	why am i eating anywhere else ? got 10 perfectly made jalapeno and cheese pupusas for $ 20 . added on plantains with refried beans and sour cream for another $ 6 . entire meal was , as always , ethereal . seriously makes me miss waking up to anoles running around wherever i was staying in central america . bonus , the basement is a club on the weekends . karaoke on fridays .
mexican	they sign they have added to front of store looks nice . the food as always delicious . very friendly customer service and always see them helping new customers with the menu . keep up the good work guys .
mexican	just wrecked a pastor burrito and it was the bizomb ! ! ! ! i can 't wait to go back you guys rock ! ! !
mexican	my goto : plain chimi + cheese tortilla ... yummm and the sauce , , , man , , we get extra sauce every time to use at home ... only flaw hear is some of the " moist " or wet ingredient burritos , tear up the tortilla and makes a mess .. now other than expecting a line , we would be here at least once a week , but coming from chandler , its a bit far to try to eat here for our 1 hour lunch time ..
mexican	the patio still appears like your sitting in an alley , so i prefer the indoor seating with the weird decorations . finally have tried the chicken tinga $ 2 tacos and it is a good dose of white chicken in that famous crispy taco shell which never breaks apart when you bite down . also , margarita 's are 1 / 2 price ( only house ) , but they could be stronger . the quesadilla was just $ 5 at hh and again , it was loaded with filling and had a nice crispness on the edges . they could give you a cup of guacamole , but you get a side of sour cream instead .
mexican	the ' red chili pork posole ' is truly awesome ! the pork adovado is great too . now that it is winter time , i 've found the interior to be way too cold - i end up keeping my coat on which sucks !
mexican	i 've had the jalapeño popper , the chili relleno , chicken , fig and carmel , and banana nutella empanadas . all were freakin amazing . i 'm going to take my uncle there tomorrow .
mexican	skeptical my first time but i saw the happy hour special . was shocked how good it was ! ! reminds me of tacos from tijuana almost . all the tacos are good and so are the burritos . they cook it for you to see and quick too . highly recommend this shop !
mexican	makes me feel like i 'm back in rocky point at the fish market . must try and they now accept cards , which is great for me since i never have cash ! !
mexican	combination chicken taco , and enchiladas are great and surprisingly the honey bbq wings are to die for !
mexican	get the same thing - 2 chili rollino 's and a side of guacamole . yum yum yum ! i start craving them middle of the week . i 've eaten at a lot of mexican restaurants - arizona , utah , new mexico , colorado - el rodeo gets the trophy ! colorful atmosphere , authentic food and free spanish lessons every saturday ( failing miserably but they never seem to give up ! )
mexican	been coming here for 10 plus years ............. the rice & beans remind so much of my nana 's , brings back great memories of my childhood .
mexican	best food ? ? absolutely not , but top 5 in phoenix . best ambience ? absolutely . best service ? ? absolutely . the combo = can 't be beat in the phoenix area ! !
mexican	great lunch place . everything rocks . i would give it 5stars , however the service and food presentation has slacked a but since new ownership took over . definite on a vegas trip of cold beers and tasty mex .
mexican	the lamb and cheese dip is phenomenal ! highly recommended and great for family and very kid friendly ! great environment !
mexican	the tacos de asada are the best and the aguas frescas are all delicious .
mexican	i love coming here and inviting my friends to try it out . i strongly recommend this place to anyone who wants a good mexican street style taco !
mexican	been coming here for 3 years love the food and the girls are always really nice and the owner as well
mexican	been coming here for 4 years best tacos in vegas , the meat is really good and juicy every time we come always the same good tasty meat you can 't go wrong here i highly recommend this place , customer service is excellent , day and night always great food and service .
mexican	food never lets me down . also have some of the best margaritas in the arizona .
mexican	found this place by accident and keep coming back and bringing friends everytime i come to town . service is friendly and attentive , food is always fresh and tasty ! margaritas are also always on point , they have lots of flavors . this place never disappoints ! !
mexican	the stuffed chile rellenos and papas are awesome . we totally dig the happy hour as well . dos xx amber on draft , chilled mugs , good eats---until 7 : 00 !
mexican	i 'm not sure what the restaurant was before this taco shop but whatever it was the universe is better off without it because it brought us el chino . the tacos are delish . the burritos are delish . i 've tried almost everything by now ( several items i had never heard of and a few i never thought i 'd try ) and everything is delicious . juan , i believe in of the owners , is very friendly .. the cooks in the back pump out some amazing food like a well oiled machine . even when it 's busy i don 't have to wait long for my order . definitely recommend .
mexican	man the jerk chicken is consistently great , patties are always fresh . highly recommend
mexican	the service is always great and the food is amazing ! i usually get the mini platter ( feeds two ! ) or the santa fe salad they are delicious ! the happy hour is great ! and they do margarita specials on tuesdays and saturdays ! i recommend popo 's fiesta del sol to all my friends when they are craving mexican food !
mexican	service is excellent every time . i have eaten just about everything on the menu over the years and haven 't found anything that wasn 't delicious . highly recommend to anyone craving good ol mom and pop mexican food . compares to my favorites in socal anyday !
mexican	i have never had a bad experience , from the food to the service , it has always been way above par . beats any of the local chains , and definitely any national chain . local family owned goodness right here . headed there right now , got hungry just thinking about it .
mexican	been coming here for a long time my favorite is the carne asada plate i love their chips and salsa they are busy all the time but their service is fast and good !
mexican	a friend and i started the little " car show " about 4 years ago , got them a lot of business ! i always get their carne asada burritos with no pico and rice / beans on the side . they don 't screw up my order and i 've never gotten sick eating there .
mexican	la iianera is to die for . i ask for raw red onion with it . as mentioned before , the servers are all very warm and welcoming and the food is fantastic especially for gluten allergies . no compromising taste to accommodate dietary restrictions here . these sandwiches pack a punch and are very filling . i 'm so glad this place isn 't too far from home !
mexican	if you 're looking for lots of yellow cheese on your mexican food , this is not your place ; think authentic . while many of the great places like monti 's are now gone , this place still delivers. if you haven 't been here give it a try . everyone is friendly and the food is fantastic. and now ..... back to my margarita !
mexican	it has always been great . the gollo burro is to die for . my dad would eat here every week if he could get away with it . never had a bad meal and i have eaten the entire menu . wonderful family run business .
mexican	great red chile and green chile and outstanding fish tacos . i have one complaint . when i come inside to dine , i receive complimentary chips and hot sauce . but , when i go through the drive through , chips cost extra . why ? ? ? the answer they gave me was that getting free chips is my reward for " joining them inside for a meal . " so , i am punished because i didn 't eat inside ? ridiculous . chips and salsa is pretty standard at all mexican food restaurants in the valley . don 't nickel and dime someone because the took their food to go . still a paying customer . please fix this policy .
mexican	anyway , it 's our go-to mexican place . the food is always good , and the service acceptable ( has actually improved in recent months as they 've hired more people ) . take a look around ... lots of hispanic people eat here . that 's got to say something .
mexican	great authentic mexican food for a very reasonable price ! go try it !
mexican	good for kids too as you can order a la cart beans and rice with a tortilla and my kids were happy ! ! good salsa and recently they added mexican popsicles that are so yummy ! ! ! reasonable prices and clean too ! ! ! one of our families favorite places . nothing fancy just great food ! !
mexican	everything is great but i recommend the bean and cheese with sauce and add rice . nobody makes a better bean and cheese burrito than elmers .
mexican	i live in chandler and drive nearly an hour just to eat here and enjoy the scenery . the chips and salsa are absolutely amazing and so is the food . make sure you call ahead to try and reserve a table by the pond ( inside by the windows during the summer months ) .
mexican	it 's the only restaurant we regularly visit . service is always great and the food is amazing . pollo funditto for life !
mexican	spicy , layers of seasoning , just great food . margaritas are legendary as well . new mexico / santa fe cuisine in arizona like no other . looking forward to the next 20 !
mexican	been coming here for over 25 years , love the good & super authentic , great service and easy location to get to in a nice clean neighborhood
mexican	chips and salsa are supreme . light and crispy . salsa is fresh and flavorful . spinach queso like no other . had my usual # 2 , red enchilada , shredded beef taco and tostada .. way more food than most people can consume . had to have shredded beef taco first , the best anywhere . red ench next and easily done but no room for tostada . although the food was very good it wasn 't as good as i 've had . always five stars but this trip was 4 * * * * . still definitely worth a stop for authentic mexican flavors .
mexican	great variety and authentic recipes . several staff been here for many many years . love the sour cream enchiladas .
mexican	the prices are great and the food is delicious . one of the best places to eat in pittsburgh .
mexican	the food is always fresh and tasty . some favorites are the fish tacos and sopa de pollo ... also , the margaritas are great . service is pretty good , but at times it seems the wait staff can be a bit forgetful . other than that , great place !
mexican	i sit at the bar and brian and little brian and eric are amazing . best service you could ask for in vegas . i will continue to come here as long as these three guys are here !
mexican	such great food ! guacamole is da bomb and there chips holly smokes ! i get the stake tacos so yummy ! we always bring someone new here and they feel the same way about the food ! five stars delicious
mexican	2 chicken tacos rice and beans : ) very good
mexican	across from the community college . tacos are extremely tasty and very reasonably priced .
mexican	always the same steak burrito , it 's quite different than many mexican style burritos all over the city , there is potatoes and other things in it and the steak is pan-friend . anyways , really tasty food . service isn 't quick , it 's one guy working there and it usually takes at least 15 minutes for each burrito . point taken off for the sometimes loud top 40 radio playing in there , know your clientele dude , nobody wants to hear adele and katy perry loudly while waiting 15 minutes for a burrito .
mexican	if you 're looking for very high quality traditional mexican food , javier 's is the place to come when in las vegas . i had the jalapeño margarita and it was absolutely delightful . the carnitas are moist and delicious . they have a mexican rendition of steal and lobster called mar y tierra that will blow your mind . even though they constantly have a line out the door , it 's well worth the wait .
mexican	a little hole-in-the-wallish , but that 's part of it 's charm . it 's fine , no-frills delicious mexican , with excellent chips and home-made hot sauce . just about every item on the menu is a winner .
mexican	made to order . breakfast burrito bowls are my favorite .
mexican	been coming here for years and never disappointed great food great service they catered our company xmas party and we are back today to schedule a baby shower to be catered highly recommend
mexican	been coming here for years and they deserve a review , very few times have i been dissatisfied .. i love the carne asada and the breakfast burritos always delicious
mexican	matter of fact i get out out of my way ignoring the plethora of iranian restaurants in the area just to eat here . yes , i know it is a hole in the wall and yes you eat in take away containers with plastic forks , seating on simple chair but if you 're willing to over look that and just enjoy simple food like you were in tehran than this is a place you got to check . oh yes . did i mention it 's really cheap ? less than 10 bucks for a meal with a soft drink . cant beat that .
mexican	definitely one of the best mexican food restaurants in north lv . the fajitas and fresh guacamole are especially good . customer service is usually great but can drop off during busy times . highly recommended !
mexican	it 's hard to find a traditional mexican yummy spot ! but this place always hits the spot ! best flour tortillas too !
mexican	i usually have their fish tacos but sometimes the shrimp or tri-tip . always good choices . you can always help yourselves to chips and salsa to have with your meal and drinks . the chips used to be house made , not so sure any more , but good nevertheless . they have a full bar and plenty of tv 's to watch sports . all in all a good , neighborhood joint to spend a casual friday night or afternoon passing the time with friends , cold drinks and good food .
mexican	first as chuys and now cc 's . even better now ! check out my food pics .
mexican	have never had a bad meal . the margaritas are always good . the food is will prayed and always fast . the service is efficient if sometimes not the friendliest . my favorite is the no name dinner . wife enjoys the speedy gonzalez lunch special . you cannot go wrong coming here .
mexican	i love it for what it is . cheap burrito place , nothing fancy about it . just fresh ingredients , put together well ..... for the perfect burrito experience . lets face it ...... what else do you need when you have that burrito craving ? ? ? ? also a great place for some funny late night drunk people experiences !
mexican	i only order pollo blanco enchiladas or the pollo con queso burrito . both are always great . the service is usually meh but not bad . good chips and salsa .
mexican	it 's my favorite mexican restaurant and i always visit when i come to phoenix from denver . sadly , the impetus of my review today is a complaint . before we were able to order another patron was checking on the status of their order . angel , the woman at the counter assured her it would be ready in five minutes and that it was delayed " because you had a big order . " we then watched angel print the patrons ticket , give it to the kitchen and asked for it to be rushed . sometimes things fall through the cracks but the right thing to do here is to admit the mistake ... not flat out lie . i really hate liars .
mexican	love their fish tacos shredded beef tacos breakfast burritos and super nachos w carne asada . i heard they have there own farm so meat taste way better than average . i 've never had a bad experience here . i come here a couple times a week . great service as well . churros are yum . can 't go wrong with anything here . they have daily taco specials as well . : -d
mexican	love the tacos , quesadillas , wet burrito and lentil soup . great place for lunch or dinner . wish they were open on sunday 's . when i get burritos elsewhere i 'm usually disappointed they 're not as good as el sombrero . they might be a little more expensive but they 're worth it .
mexican	no matter what i order , i 'm always satisfied . a must for me is their fried platains , all time favorite ! also their agua frescas are amazing . good way to cool off in this summer heat ! !
mexican	i always only go through drive through . service has been fast and efficient and friendly . the food also is very consistent . i recommend you order a side of nacho cheese sauce to go with your french fries . also i am a big fan of the del carbon tacos . i also like the fish tacos .
mexican	one of my fav mexican restaurant in the valley . great margaritas as well as food and if you come on a tuesday they are only .99 ! the chicken enchiladas are a personal fav , but the abondagas and chicken tortilla soups are to die for !
mexican	great homey decor , huge tequila selection , good chips and salsa . delicious enchiladas , tortas , combos . good margueritas and good mexican beer selection . recommended .
mexican	salmon tacos are amazing as are their cheese enchiladas with green sauce . my daughters moved away and insist we come here every time they visit . great staff especially ashley ! ! !
mexican	i love the service because everyone is so nice . thank you for that btw . i would love warm chips and fideo to top off the experience . great job people !
mexican	the best cuban food in the city . you can 't go wrong with anything on the menu . my favorite is the lechon asado . the staff is very friendly and always nice . you won 't be disappointed .
mexican	the staff is friendly and the food is always fresh and tasty as hell . awesome mexican food , and great location ; it 's close to everything in old town .
mexican	this family owned local az style mexican food place is my fave . everything is always fresh and tasty . service is always great .
mexican	this is the greatest filib 's of all time . no doubt ! food is consistently delicious
mexican	this place is definitely a step above a roberto 's but not exactly the best mexican food . though in the area it is probably the best bang for your buck . my husband is from san diego so he 's tasted enough mexican fast food that are not chains . he has frequently said this offers pretty good food and easily rivals sd mexican fast food . we always get nachos , al pastor plate , and / or cali burrito . our nachos have always came out pretty good . sometimes they do put too much cheese but at least they always put a generous amount of meats .
mexican	used to be the best , but after new owners took over , it has slipped a little ! great salsa , and spinach enchiladas !
mexican	some staff been there years , some not but i find the food be tasty and fresh . samantha 's healthy burrito and the chicken tacos are really good . the $ 2.99 margaritas are tasty but pretty much no alcohol , but refreshing . * * * * alert , there is a heavy set female hispanic server there on nights , no nice , not pleasant , always dread her . tonight she was there again , zero personality and she reminds me of a women 's prison guard , she wears ugly ripped up jeans . why do they keep her , she is horrible ! ! ! everyone else is quite nice there avoid her , she sucks ! !
mexican	delicious every time . best tamales and homemade tortillas you can find .
mexican	i love the chips and salsa and usually the service is always good . i love the enchiladas , shredded beef and green sauce . i have also had a steak there and it had cheesy goodness on top ... bomb . they have a good happy hour as well : )
mexican	kind of hard to place orders in drive thru but that 's not a deal killer when the food is this good . amazing hard shell beef tacos , carne asada fries , and an assortment of churros are all a +
mexican	the sign out front still isn 't lit at night so it 's easy to drive by if you don 't know where it 's at . they 've expanded to seat more people as the original only had a few tables . only downfall is they charge for an extra bowl of chips . might as well just order a nachos . quick attentive service and decently priced .
mexican	fresh imgrediants and friendly staff . best red potato salad in town . get there early as they get very busy .
mexican	hands down , the best mexican food in town . i 'm in the air force and have lived all over the country . i have yet to find mexican food anywhere else that can compare to popo 's . every time i come back to phoenix for a visit , popo 's is the first stop i make . excellent rice ! don 't forget to ask for the red sauce with your chips !
mexican	this hot spot has a constant stream of locals and visitors and it is always alive ! ! ! happy hour trends and if you don 't arrive early , no seat for you ! will , my favorite bartender for years ... is on point ! food is traditional and although now a series of restaurants , the quality has not waivered . see you here soon !
mexican	sad they moved the location but this is def. a great spot for mexican dishes and margaritas = )
mexican	it has never failed ! love love love this place beyond reason . the el pollo especial is the best , but many others are close runners up .
mexican	theyve hardly ever messed up my order- i cant even think of once actually . melanie is best in the drive thru , shes always really friendly and sweet .. must not be an az native ! = ) ive seen her like triple check my bag before- so shes really thurough . i usually dont go in to eat- havent in years since it was the go to munchie place when i was a teen . so i cant really comment on inside ... but the drive thru has never been an issue - that and the food is consistent and good !
mexican	amazing food . makes you feel like you 're part of the family !
mexican	best tacos i 've found ... green chile is sooooo good .
mexican	i 'm salvadorian myself and their pupusas are the best in az ! !
mexican	run by a good family making home style mexican food . you won 't be disappointed !
mexican	i 'm not in a high chair anymore , but still throw rice on the floor when i get excited . the machacha burro is the best in the valley , imo . cheese crisp with chili strips , yum ! sasparilla bottle to drink with my meal . free chips with unlimited refills , served with free salsa ( mild and hot ) . delicious , just stick with the machacha burro ! this is a family owned restaurant that employs neighborhood kids . support local business , this one is great !
mexican	i 've even driven family here from tucson as i feel there is nothing local to compare it to . whatever is ordered is sure to be a winner . my personal favorite is the taco toscada and enchilada with rice and beans . no visit would be complete without the cooked to order tortilla chips with the house made red and green salsa
mexican	been coming to here about once a month for the past five years , great food for a reasonable price.my only complaint is that every once in a blue moon a new employee ruins my burrito by not rolling it properly .
mexican	i love this place ! ! always great food & quick service ! baja burrito is my favorite or one of many .
mexican	the free chips and salsa are fresh and delicious . i usually get the lime juice when they have it , but their horchata is good too .
mexican	food is consistent and affordable , plus they have longer hours now at the new location ! norm is virtually always present and cares about his customers .
mexican	the chorizo breakfast burrito is fantastic along with the tacos . actually haven 't tried anything yet that i didn 't like . only drawback is they need some background music , tv or something . eerily quiet when dining in .
mexican	they have some of the best burritos in town . their quesadillas and combo plates are all very good as well . and i havent found a better green salsa or breakfast burrito anywhere else . i highly recommend trying them out !
mexican	we love to sit at the " presidential table " haha . the food is always good and the service is always with a smile . it can be a little slow on the lunch rush but that 's to be expected . all in all this is a great mexican food restaurant in central phoenix !
mexican	been coming to this place since before the one in ahwatukee shut down several years ago ... food is consistently great but i 'm really sad they took away the free bean dip !
mexican	very good food to go along with customer service . if you 're looking for a place to grab a quick bite while in the uptown area be sure to stop in and check this place out .
mexican	never have i had a problem , or issue , or bad service . very consistent ( good ) quality ! awesome that it became 24 / 7 eat in , as well as drive thru !
mexican	food is always fresh and taste great . salsa bar is always stocked and fresh . staff is friendly and helpful . always clean . the cashier lot is always on point with his service . great job
mexican	can 't say i 've ever had any issues . my one complaint is there were times i felt some of their employees in the drive-thru want to be stingy with the hot sauce ! like bruh .. i gotta have my hot sauce baby ! lol i want to say that was going on after the most recent remodeling but more recently the late night drive thru girls always ask me how many sauces i want ! as for my food it always taste good ! and service is friendly and quick !
mexican	if i want fast food , i 'll go to chipotle but for a sit down experience better than macayos , i 'll come here . try the fajita 's , they are fantastic . if you have a tight budget , consider going on wednesday night for some great values and always look out for the coupon mailers . we normally try to go once a month .
mexican	she also fell in love with their churros for dessert , says best ever had in this country ! ! !
mexican	i came accross this place and saw a almost 5 star raiting with almost 200 reviews and decided to give it a shot . i am so glad i did . the food is awesome and the customer service was on point . i can see if this place were to be super busy they could take a while , but the food is made to order . it 's not fast food . this definetly isn 't the closest taco spot to me but after trying it , it 's going to be my go to spot . great job csts .
mexican	proudly owned and managed by a wonderful family . pride of ownership shows in the service , cleanliness , and quality of the food . it 's our go to place when we want good food in a hurry . very reasonable as well
mexican	wife is from tx so this is her taste of home . when tx folks come to visit they ask to go to don 's . it 's very good tex-mex .
mexican	i ordered a carne asada salad and my friend ordered nachos . they are both really good . they didn 't ask us what type of beans and just gave us both pinto beans which i don 't like . the salad itself was pretty good but the meat was not as fresh as i 'd like . nachos we 're really good and hot . i 'll go back and try different meats and the fresh juices .
mexican	the cheese enchiladas are great ! strawberry frozen margaritas are tasty . the chips and salsa come with bean dip and guacamole standard . this is one of my favorite mexican restaurants anywhere !
mexican	was trilled to have the location on bell rd and scottsdale rd open close to the house . their food is always great and never had a bad experience . chips and salsa are awesome . i always order the combo # 9 with a green chili burro and 2 tacos . the cheese crisp , tamales and mexican pizza are always good . good service and a separate area for take out are nice for this newer location . will always come back for the great food and service .
mexican	this is one of the franchise restaurants and one of the larger restaurant . we ordered the open face cheese quesidilla which was nice and crispy . i ordered one of their signature dishes the pollo fundido which are chicken chimichanga with sour cream and cheese which are always good . my daughter ordered the fish tacos which were cod in a soft tortilla and presented nicely . the last dish we had were the pork fajitas that came out nice and sizzling . always love the chips and salsa that they have and generally pretty good about replenishing .
mexican	the food is still made with the same family recipes . we love the chili rellanos as they are filled with beef , versus most places having cheese filling . chips and salsa are fresh . they are closed on sunday 's .
mexican	i have recently moved back to seattle after living in east mesa for 12 years and cannot find the quality and authenticity of rudy 's anywhere here . my family and i have eaten there , mostly takeout , hundreds of times , and never been disappointed . the owner is a super nice guy , and the food is super good . i miss it tons and highly recommend to anybody looking for delicious mexican food .
mexican	pricing is good , atmosphere is great . best mexican food in the valley !
mexican	the food hasn 't changed in 25 years . jade red chicken is obviously a favorite here . the cuban black beans and jerk fried rice are the two perfect sides to go with . you can order any of the meats here inside a burrito or quesadilla too , for some variety : d
mexican	never disappointed ! whether it 's the truck or the actual location ! so good ! great staff and owners !
mexican	the letter d crisp and green chili burrito are my top choices !
mexican	we went tonight , took 25 minutes to be acknowledged by sara the bar tender .... we were sitting at the bar ! we planned to eat but after it took an hour before we got our second drink we decided to leave hungry . we ended up eating el pollo loco instead . thanks the grind ! * * * * update * * * * we decided to give the place another try . sarah the terrible bar tender wasn 't working . the original bar tender who runs the place like a well oiled machine was back . drinks great ! food great ! restaurant redeemed . we will be back ! please let sarah go , she 's terrible !
mexican	i 'll write more when i 'm feeling more verbose , but had to quibble . this is not tex-mex ! ! ! ! hello yelp , are you asleep at the switch on this ? it 's new mexican , get it right . calling it tex-mex is totally insulting to people from new mexico . it would be like saying that japanese and chinese food is the same because they both use a lot of rice .
mexican	something between 15 and 20 years ago.love it ! i 'll admit sometimes the cooks might be having a bad day . but we all do . the manager has always stops by to greet me while i 'm there . and is always concerned about our meals . he has always made our visits pleasurable , corrected and even replaced an order for us if we didn 't like it or if it wasn 't done right . please people before you bash or give a bad review , give a restaurant at least 3 or 4 visits before you bash them . the staff is very welcoming and friendly . the food is amazing
mexican	they have the best salsa in town . i always get the # 2 beef . the mexican pizza is a great option for sharing with another person . it gets busy , so get there early on the weekends , or order to go like we always do .
mexican	good chips and salsa and the spaniard is my favorite .
mexican	the food is great . it is kind of a dive , and the ordering is a little weird , but the food totally makes up for it . they blend mexican and chinese food . the machaca rice bowl with plain fried rice is my fav ! good place to eat . try to stay clear on sunday afternoons though . once the huge church up the street lets out , that place is packed . there is usually at least a 30 minute line when that happens .
mexican	tijuana torpedo is perfection with onion rings . it hasn 't changed at all and that 's a very good thing .
mexican	always good quality homemade food . very affordable and great service always aa well ! !
mexican	love the tamales , red chili , tacos , salsa , mole and everything else i 've tried ! ! ! one of the best restaurants in town ! !
mexican	roman , the head waiter , is always prompt , courteous , and in a delightful mood like he has always been for the years he 's worked there , and being a engineer i know the old cliche is true " good help is hard to find " thanks for the years of great food at a great price !
mexican	been eating here for years ... food very tasty .. girls at counter , always pleasant .. the prices sure beat the big restaurants ... the prices are identical to roberto 's , , i live the same distance between these two .... but i usually come here for one silly reason , , , , the self-serve salsa ... very good .... roberto 's doesn 't have salsa , they have hot sauce only , , & it can burn the chrome off of a bumper ..... didn 't give 5 stars , cause they don 't have beer ...
mexican	it 's our favorite mexican restaurant . our only complaint over the years has been the poor bathrooms . they have always been dirty , run down , unkept . we try and avoid them at all costs .
mexican	love everything about this place ! i highly recommend it if you havent tried it yet .
mexican	love it ! ! tacos are amazing ! burros are fabulous ! i am never disappointed !
mexican	mostly during lunch . excellent menu selection , great service and great tasting mexican food for a chain restaurant . dinner meals are huge and you 'll be stuffed when you or if you finish it .
mexican	been eating here for years the food has always been good they have the best salsa my dad had his retirement party there years ago and the service was top notch the best the bar area is comfortable
mexican	been eating here for years they make all there meats on site i even buy my lunch meats here
mexican	food is always good . efficient fast service they can go thru a line that is to the front door very quickly . only complaint is the cost of their guacamole .
mexican	awesome place with delicious food that has great variety . friendly staff and an overall clean environment with very little wait for food my suggestions : carne asada fries carne asada california burrito pollo asada burrito and to top it off some jamaica juice
mexican	been eating here since i was a child ... love the food and the people , highly recommend .
mexican	this restaurant has a lot of memories for me . the food is really great , though not as authentic as some of the hole-in-the-wall mexican food places scattered around arizona . definitely worth a visit !
mexican	been eating here since i was a kid out on 14 street always got to stop when im in the hood !
mexican	been eating here since i was kid , and still get excited like a kid when i walk in and order ..
mexican	since i moved away from the area i look for any excuse when i am working the area to eat here . very fresh , delicious . roberto 's has nothing on these guys , in fact a roberto 's is around the corner and is empty at lunch time . riva 's is legit .
mexican	in fact , to get there , we drive right by el encanto in cave creek . we like dos better ! very efficient wait staff ( we always eat in the bar ) . i love their chicken burros doused in mild salsa . that mild salsa is made up of nearly 20 different items and has never let us down . our chips are always great ! love the place and the staff , just wish el encanto was as good to save us the miles !
mexican	* i am a regular at this restraunt . best tacos in the valley ! hands down ! simple menu , fair pricing on the food , clean welcoming feeling at the restraunt . absolutely good food and service . only one problem about this place . it needs to find a bigger location to fit all the customers that go there .
mexican	green chili chimi is fantastic , the salsa / hot sauce are as good as the best .
mexican	one of my favorite places , original and delish . i always order a queso fundido , marguerita , and try to experience new things each time . the chocolate tamale is a must for desert .
mexican	but the last couple time i have gotten tamales the have been heavy on the corn meal and light on the meat . i truely hope it was a new cook or something along those line . but i have feeling the are being " cost effective . " still good but not at the level they use to be at
mexican	we went later in the evening and were spoiled by the staff ; very attentive and friendly . decor is really nice , good music , few tvs playing music videos and sports games . to sum up the food : fresh & flavorful ! ! we had tostones - cheese empanadas - salad - fried cheese - salami - chicharrone de pollo - bistec encebollado - moro - arroz con leche . the portions were generous and priced appropriately . we were told they 'll be getting presidente beer soon too ; can 't wait ! ! looking forward to returning , so much i still wanna try
mexican	i was so excited to try and this restaurant did not disappoint . authentic and the bomb . had tostones con ajo y butter olive oil sauce . alcapurria 's were stuffed with meat . the pernil was so tender , the mofongo was tender . and last but not least the bistec encebollados was perfectly seasoned . this was a family style dinner and no one was hungry after .
mexican	$ 5 daily specials can 't be beat ! food is authentic mexican style and very flavorful . service is very good . come hungry as portions are big ! ( even with the $ 5 specials ) i 've recommended a few friends here and they enjoy it as well .
mexican	we rotate between their chili relleno , chili verde , shrimp , carne asada , fish and chorizo .
mexican	haven 't even found a taco that comes close to this . if you haven 't eaten here yet : you are doing it wrong !
mexican	i 've been eating the enchiladas and it is fantastic ! the enchiladas themselves are good , but the green sauce takes it to the next level . if this were a brick and mortar joint , i 'd be bringing the lady .
mexican	been going for to this place for years ... the red chile and green chile burritos are the best ... the pan is bomb a spot you should check out .....
mexican	been going here 10 years plus we always have great food and service 2 locations surprise and el mirage el mirage is the best old school mexican and always spot on
mexican	tableside guac is amazing as well . the new fish tacos are awesome
mexican	everything is always fresh and has great , authentic flavor . have had the adobada , asada , chorizo , chicken and shrimp . all were tender , moist and delicious . the sopes are great and burritos are a great value . will continue to come here in the future !
mexican	love the food and the people here . try the mexican pizza . it 's the best i 've had anywhere .
mexican	service is good and food never disappoints . the family hasn 't changed anything in all the years we have going here and that 's a good thing ! love the serrano 's special quesadilla with pork !
mexican	been going here for 20 years - amazing authentic mexican and great family run service !
mexican	the red chili beef is amazing , but the standard for me is the strips and the bean & cheese burrito . classics .
mexican	you know it 's a good hole in the wall place when you see mercedes and whatnot rolling through the drive through . burritos are huge and only 5 bucks . go here .
mexican	great for lunch , great authentic mexican food , served by real mexicans . the tacos have varying degrees of spiciness , so if your into legit tacos this is your place . still wish there was the wrestling theme inside the restaurant ...
mexican	its great and on our regular rotation of places to eat . the only 2 things i have had there is the green or red burrito but its so good that i don 't want to try anything else . the ladies at the counter are always nice and the food is always great . the burrito i get is 3.99 and they give you a cup of chips with salsa . the best i 've had in central phoenix and we tried most of em .
mexican	one of my go to spots now ! some of the best burgers in town ! sure there can be a wait time but it 's a small mom and pop place not mcdonalds . great customer service and always stellar food . keep doing what you 're doing !
mexican	great food , great prices , great service . any negative feedback has to have come from their competition . great place .
mexican	been going here forever and always go back , even got married there in the dining room with all the family i have going here with all along. one of those neighborhood treasures you grow up with and still go back to the ' hood for .
mexican	they have the best salsa , beans , and shredded beef ! love the burritos and tacos !
mexican	family owned and operated . delicious food and great prices . worth the drive no matter where we live in the metro phoenix area . puts the chains to shame . thanks reynoso 's !
mexican	i was born at the hospital next door lol best salsa and huge tequila menu . you cannot go wrong with anything you order . i wouldn 't expect super classy . its a neighborhood restraunt and has always been that way .
mexican	this is the best mexican food on the planet , don 't skip out on the tacos monterrey . # 75 is where it 's at .
mexican	always get the same thing for my husband when kids and i have eaten already . i bring him the mojarra frita and it 's always been consistently delicious . people are friendly too .
mexican	it really makes life that much better . it 's fast and healthy depending on what you order ! their hot sauce is bomb as well as their guacamole and quesadillas .
mexican	bean and chesse burros are awesome . love the potato tacos too .
mexican	always potato , because life is miserable without potato burritos in it , but have tried bites of their other food and always wanted more . go ! now ! why are you still reading this and not using both hands to hold a massive potato masterpiece ! ? ! ? viva la taco tonto 's ! ! !
mexican	now it 's a food truck with an extensive menu . i recommended the hot dogs , vampiros and street tacos . delicious ! !
mexican	red chili burro double wrapped , 2 shredded beef tacos and chips and salsa .
mexican	great cheap , authentic mexican food . specials . cheese dip is so yummy ! !
mexican	great neighborhood mexican fast food . they make my burritos to order . i dont like cheese so i get beans , rice , and lettuce which is deeeelicious . thanks for being awesome .
mexican	i know the owner and his family . great food and cold beer always . the street tacos are amazing along with the mixed burrito !
mexican	love the hot sauce , chili rellenos and ground beef soft tacos . of course all of that with their sour cream !
mexican	love the fajitas and quesadillas . chips and salsa are a must too !
mexican	one of my go to places . always get the fajitas . they are amazing and big enough to share . staff is always friendly . good comfort food .
mexican	the food is still the same and still good . you can 't go wrong with what you choose . the noodles are a nice touch to a burrito that we all get use too . if you haven 't had a chance to go , go and see the difference .
mexican	they always make me exactly what i ask for with no problems whatsoever . i don 't eat dairy so i get a burro with no cheese . just beans and rice . sounds easy but most places manage to screw it up ... not amado 's tho . i love this place !
mexican	i 'm a taco junkie and out of the countless taco shops i 've been to , pedro 's still has the best shredded beef tacos i 've ever had . the shells , cheese , and beef are always perfect ! great atmosphere and service , any waitress can help you . a little on the expensive side but worth it for the quality of the food . the chips and hot sauce are delicious , much better than macayo 's , valle luna , and others !
mexican	best chicken fajitas in arizona . best salsas in arizona . you guys gotta try this place ! ! ! ! !
mexican	i reccomend this place to all of my friends in avondale when looking for good mexican food on a budget . cheaper and way better than any fast food burritos
mexican	best mexican food in the valley and the service is pretty good .
mexican	never in my life have i found a better bean and cheese burrito ! blessing and a curse since i no longer live in gilbert .. but i do make the drive often ! authentic mexican food , can 't beat it .
mexican	one thing that hasn 't changed " thank god " is the salsa
mexican	hands down way better now ! i get the shredded beef tacos almost every morning , in fact i turned my whole office on to this place and they all go there now . good pricing , huge burritos , very friendly staff , and a willingness to substitute and flexibility to make the customer happy . if you have a couple bucks and are in the area give this place a shot . i personally love the tacos with red sauce ! 5 stars cause i do do anything halfassed
mexican	we try to get there for happy hour and enjoy their 2 for 1 enchanted margaritas , of course they have a huge tequila selection to try . the owner always takes a minute to greet us and then will follow up to ask us how the food was . their adovada pork is seasoned and spiced just right and those pork carnitas on the bone ares always tender and taste wonderful !
mexican	really great tacos . my favorites are the shrimp and braised beef . food is definitely 5 stars but giving it 4 stars because i really wish i had one server when we went . all the servers help out each other which is nice but never quite sure who to ask for something when we need it . everyone is super friendly and fast . this is definitely a great place to bring family and friends .
mexican	we keep trying new things from the menu and moe has taken very good care of us !
mexican	one of the best burrito / naked burritos in toronto .
mexican	great place . friendly service , good margaritas , and great chimichangas and pollo fundido .
mexican	great prices and huge portions . breakfast burrito is great .
mexican	not for the nostalgia , but for the food ! the beans , the enchiladas , the salsa .. just go .
mexican	been going since they opened on 16st & bethyhome rd. allways been one of my fav mexican food spots n town the hot sauce is great & taco rice & beans top notch all around great food good service .
mexican	always good , clean , sometimes very busy but worth the wait . the guys in my family and friends circle especially like the grilled chicken and meat. my vegetarian friends love their bean and rice . a plus , you support local , they are local family owned and operated .
mexican	very well made and big enough to fill my appetite . will definitely be trying the tortas next time after seeing them here !
mexican	keep making food i will keep eating it . my favorite is the pizza nortena extra crispy with extra green chilis and 4 sides of the very hot salsa verde ( you must request the salsa verde ) green & red chili are good . tacos morango are great and so are the loaded nachos . my husband loves the pollo blanco enchiladas . bring us a pitcher of margaritas and we are set .
mexican	love the food . always service with a smile . love the location , close to my job and home . never had a bad meal there .
mexican	mexican pizza with shredded beef , cream cheese , guacamole is to die for ! ! ! ! ! add chips and salsa , and the fried ice cream and this equals one of my very favorite meals of all time ! love having an ajo als close to my home .
mexican	great service , food is fresh to order and such a lively ambiance ! a must try ! looking forward to coming back during patio weather !
mexican	what can i say .. unique arizona place . the unique ordering system takes a bit of effort to master , but it does work . my favorites include the jerk chicken ( which i order w / jerk fried rice ) , the jade chicken , the emerald chicken , the hengrenade chicken and the quesadillas . a unique place w / a unique menu that is always worth the drive .
mexican	it is the best mexican food on the west side . absolutely delicious .
mexican	killer carne asada burrito , super supreme nachos , and chimi ! they could use a better acronym for the nachos on the receipt though ... " sprm nachos " don 't quite sound as delicious ..
mexican	everything is fresh and on point . my go to dishes are mole ' enchiladas , cochanita pibil ( marinated pork ; a popular yucatán dish ) , chile verde and of course classic chicken tacos . the salsa is amazing and don 't leave without trying a tamarindo margarita . only negative is they stopped serving the coconut ice cream ( bring it back please ) f & f the best on the westside !
mexican	love the food , never had anything bad come from here . today i tried their burritos the salsa didn 't taste home made tasted like it came from a jar . at the very least create a relationship with a filiburtos nearby and get their salsa or make your own .
mexican	if you like spicy , this is the place for you ! ! you can 't go wrong with the green chile blue corn stack enchilada with an egg on top . the beans they make are delish slurrrrrppp i 'm hungry just thinking about it ! authentic mexican food and large portions . plus you can 't go wrong with a pitcher of their strong and tasty sangria to go with your spicy meal !
mexican	they 're chips and salsa are delicious ! gina is our favorite server from this location , she always does am amazing job and is super nice !
mexican	great place . i give 4 stars because they don 't have queso dip . come on manuel 's hit me with some queso ! ! !
mexican	i used to go to one in virginia all the time as a kid . this place has always been a solid place for tex mex place for me . the food and service is always excellent and quick . i recommend the empanadas
mexican	henderson location is bigger ... great view and always awesome food ... tasty ... delicious ... yum ! ! ! ! sierra y mar is one of my fav ... lamp chops ... calamari ... and so on
mexican	i bring all of my out of town family and friends here to eat .
mexican	went again today for the first time in about a year . wanted to say it was so good and bought back its heyday about 10 years ago . everything was excellent food drink and service . great happy hour margarita for $ 3.50 . red chili beef and pork soooo good . can 't wait for my next trip . try it you won 't be sorry .
mexican	this location is especially consistent in quality food and service . love the fish tacos and their selection has really grown ! yummy .
mexican	waits were a bit long , even on a weeknight , but the service is friendly and the food was just the same . unlimited salsa and chips , and the salsa actually tastes like someone made it rather than opening a jar .
mexican	so happy they opened one in henderson . the burgers are great . fresh ingredients and made fresh every time . what more can you ask for ? want a burger and not from a fast food drive thru then check this place out .
mexican	hit the drive through and get the same great service each time . good place to take the kids and let them see some history inside . just a good way to spend your money with some local people keeping it real . blows taco bell away ! just good people making some tasty food ! check it out !
mexican	during our recent dinner here for mother 's day we had excellent service and a great meal ! they were able to get a party of 8 seated right away and were attentive to the needs to both the children and adults ! the busboy tyler was at our table serval times dropping off chips and salsa and we never had to ask for a refill ! erin was a great and attentive waitress as well ! the food was good and reasonably priced ! if you 're in the area , this small family owned place is where to go for mexican food !
mexican	i order the carne asada california burrito , it 's my favorite .
mexican	always get the number 15 . love the salsa selection . good environment , friendly staff .
mexican	been going to this place for a while now best mexican food in this side of town , never go wrong with their burritos or anything else on their menu i always get something different if u are ever around the area make sure u stop in and grab a bite to eat
mexican	.... we visit there about once a month or when company comes to town and we want to treat them to a good mexican meal ....
mexican	basic fajita and chicken menu that has stayed the same , great . love to sometimes just get the rice and beans if not in mood for meat , my vegetarian friends like it too . love love love this place anyone i have ever taken has loved it too ( alot over the years ) . staff always friendly . would have given 5 stars but sometimes it can be a little warm and seats a little hard , so i get it to go .
mexican	this is the craziest hottest hot sauce you will ever i mean ever ! ! ! !
mexican	the food has always been amazingly good except for a few instances when the carne asada has been over cooked . the food is a little smaller portioned compared to the other fast mexican food and their friendliness is a bit of a coin toss . i always go back for those mini chimis and chorizo though .
mexican	i can never go wrong with any of their items . staff is nice which helps too . cant go wrong with their drinks either . my favorite is their melon juice or the typical horchata . it doesnt look like i will ever stop going back for more food there .
mexican	best mexican food in cleveland , the tacos are amazing , and best margaritas in town
mexican	only order one thing . beef fajitas . won 't eat fajitas anywhere else . although this restaurant 's best days are behind it , the avocado salsa and fajitas will always compensate for the iffy service and lack luster environment .
mexican	always friendly service , excellent bean dip , and delicious food !
mexican	the staff and food are amazing ! love everyone who works there , especially linda , diana and carmen
mexican	staff is friendly , service is fast , food is good . what more could you ask for ?
mexican	real authentic feel even though youll find the occasional hipster in there lately .. food is consistant . service is friendly but a tad slow sometimes . margaritas can taste like the mix and not the booze ( which is why i dropped a star ) . im a big fan of the tacos . they will even give ya more chopped cilantro if you like it as much as i do ! also try to grocery store next door . produce can be a lil old though .
mexican	food smells amazing & customer service is awesome ! two thumbs up for sure ! we will be back ! ! thank you !
mexican	( fredricos- on cavecreek and 101 ) armandos has amazing food and good service , go check it out ! huge burritos for cheap !
mexican	you get lots of flavorful food . line is kind of slow but it ; s worth it .
mexican	great deal ! $ 1 tacos for either chicken or beef . limited parking . service a bit slow . but food is good . and prices are good too . worth a try if in the area .
mexican	the 3 tacos for $ 6 is the best deal for a cheap and quick lunch in downtown . the staff is always super friendly and i love the outdoor patio seating . cute little family friendly place , and the food is amazing !
mexican	and every time was delicious . i love that the red chile sauce is hot and i don 't have to add salsa
mexican	the drink specials are awesomeness . the food is a + + + + real mexican food . happy hour is the best time to come .. because the drinks are goooood
mexican	have had the chipolle chile ( very spicy ) but really good . green pork chili is way less hot but still a good amount of spice and even a really good cobb salad . the only thing i don 't rank as great is service . wait staff is nice but very inattentive . not saying it for one time but all 3 times . so , come with time and patience .
mexican	small family business . really enjoy the chili verde and tacos . some of the best mexican food in around . love it !
mexican	each time has been fantastic . the food is delicious from the burgers to the tacos ( still need to try the hot dog ) ! my favorites are probably the short rib tacos and the al pastor . staff is incredibly friendly and the owner makes sure everything is going well . great beer selection on tap ! this is a very welcomed addition to the neighborhood .
mexican	the best tacos i have had since moving from la . the quesadilla i got was so good i ate the whole thing ! the asada street taco and mole taco is just the best . the horchata was very good and unique . the salsa bar is good and clean too .
mexican	been here 3x and can 't wait to go back , love all the rolls so glad they have mexican sushi so close to my house
mexican	delicious food and unique drinks . love the concept . kudos to management for cleanliness and attentiveness !
mexican	still the best tacos in vegas ! ! ! my favorite are the cecina tacos ! but everything else i 've tried was delicious too ! highly recommended ! !
mexican	great food every single time . no complaints what so ever . the wings are delicious ; so are the fish tacos , guacamole , sushi . we have tried many things and they 're all amazing . every time i go back i get the wings because i loved them so much . lol music can be a little loud but not too bad . the drinks are ehh for me . i don 't like all the twists they have to them . mangorita was good ! ! i wonder if you can order a regular moscow mule or mojito instead of what they have ? i highly recommend .
mexican	i had heard they had fantastic tacos - and they do . love the blend of mexican / korean fusion . flavors are awesome . go try it out - you won 't be disappointed and you can walk out for less than $ 10 . i keep going back to tacos - had the burrito once . bulgogi tacos - so good . service for the limited staff - just excellent - they take care of you .
mexican	my wife was once but ever since that time she is always happy . their salsas are excellent and every dish i have received is excellent . would highly recommend this establishment . not sure if they take reservations but i would look into it as they get busy .
mexican	great food and great staff . i also use my belly app and got a free meal recently . it 's definitely my preferred mexican restaurant in hudson .
mexican	i used to go to the burrito place next door , but find the food here much tastier when i need a quick bite . the ' loaded gun ' and ' turn up ' are my favorites . portions are solid and the meat always tastes fresh . so glad this place came to the annex ! they recently started serving burgers as well which i 'll be trying shortly .
mexican	at times , the staff is friendly with a smile on their face and making jokes . but at other times , they are rude , they make it seem like you are bothering them and they seem more concerned about talking to each other than to you . then you get down to pay and the cashier is either on it and understands what you ordered , or you basically need to spell it out . so be prepared for great food with bipolar customer service .
mexican	best tacos around period . i haven 't tried anything else . why ?
mexican	also their chimichanga combination plate is delicious , the burrito itself is nice and crispy with loads of shredded beef inside .
mexican	) . both visits resulted in happy tummies , assisted by friendly and helpful waitstaff . all dishes sampled were tasty and flavourful without being greasy . on my last visit , i enjoyed the huevos and chorizo ( scrambled eggs and sausage ) immensely -- spicy , filling , and yummy . portions are generous and the chips and salsa appetizer ( gratis ) help to stave hunger pangs while waiting for your meal . the salsa could be a little bit spicier , but it tasted fresh and tomato-y . the decor has an intimate feel to it : dim lighting and understated wall art ( nothing gaudy or over-the-top ) . i would enjoy a dinner here on a date night . : )
mexican	the guacamole sample is always a must--the crab one is my personal favorite but any of them are amazing . the margaritas are great as well , and they have so many flavors ! they also have a marg sampler if you 'd like to try a few . the place is always packed ( maybe since guy fieri featured it on triple d ) , so get there early and maybe , just maybe you 'll grab a seat at the bar . parking around the area is a little hard . they only have a small lot and the rest is residential street parking . again , get there early .
mexican	the first time , i had the mexicali sampler , and it had a good variety of things on it . my favorite thing was the enchiladas . this was the first time i ever tried a raw food restaurant and it was great . i brought my dad when he came for a visit and we both ordered the enchiladas . i definitely want to try something else next time , but those enchiladas are so awesome it 's hard to not order them . i think it 's a tad pricey for what you get , but the food is really awesome . i like the samplers because you get a good variety .
mexican	i highly recommend the bandeja paisa . empanadas are also very good .
mexican	i have liked all their food . the pozole , burritos , tamales , supreme fries , and cakes are all delicious
mexican	love the authentic mexican food being served here ! a lil ' pricey but overall worth it !
mexican	had the menudo and my daughter had a combo plate . came out quickly and kept our drinks filled . thx rita 's .
mexican	food is terrific , love the corn rolled in cheese . tacos are generous and tasty . grab a cold mexican coke and enjoy !
mexican	service is great but the menu items are kinda pricy . but their lunch specials are a bargain with a good amount of food . i love everything i tried and portions are more than enough . the thing that keeps me coming back is the table side guacamole . it 's so fresh and seasoned just right .
mexican	the food is good , not authentic really , but definitely good . the margarita flavors are interesting ( banana ? ) but also good . i would definitely come back . oh , and parking is usually super easy because it 's in a shared lot .
mexican	good burritos for a reasonable price . usually i get the half chicken , half beef , with everything in it . for $ 9 with tax you get a big burrito which is pretty filling . everything tastes pretty good . i heard their poutine is good as well . way better than mucho burrito and chipotle ( which is super overhyped ) . big bite is a good burrito joint with the same taste , price , and quality of its competitors . 4 / 5 .
mexican	: ) food is delicious and zucchini fries is a must ! there 's nothing to complain about . maybe if it 's busy and you need to use the bathroom and have to wait for someone behind the counter to press the button but that 's not a deal breaker for coming here .
mexican	has a little bit of kick to it on the spicy side . reminds me of a tostada but fluffier . it 's the best indian fried bread places i love to go to .
mexican	for lunch today we ordered a carnitas chimichanga plate and a carne asada wet burrito . very flavorful , nice large portions , and not too costly . food tastes home made , beans are light and fluffy , rice was cooked perfectly . we will be back !
mexican	food is consistent , service is good . the bar area has tvs , tables with high chairs as well as booths . love the salsa and chips , so much better than store bought ! my mom and i like to get the fajitas . toppings are always fresh and unlimited . if you 're going there with a large group , call ahead . dropping in with 30 people and no reservation is not cool . i just hope none of those people wrote a review as it would be completely unfair and not a true representation of the service there . i like going here when i have no idea what i want to eat . something for everyone .
mexican	last night we had the seared scallops , padron peppers , pil pil shrimp , chicken skewers , calamari , and the lava cake . everything is well prepared but i did not care for the chicken skewers because it was not white meat . however , the lava cake is definitely worth the 15 mins wait . btw there 's a groupon right now so don 't miss out !
mexican	good food , good prices . pork tacos were the tastiest . tres leches cake was very nice too .
mexican	been here a couple times i work around the corner best tacos for this side of town for sure customer service is at an all-time premium not to mention the food is good quality
mexican	the meat is so good and high quality ! spicy without taking anything away from the flavor . it 's definitely my new go to mexican place .
mexican	the decorations and the vibe scream fiesta ! food is great and good quality and service is good . def be going there again .
mexican	quick and friendly service just like a drive thru should be . this is not your filiberto 's , eriberto 's , or whatever chain and certainly not a taco bell ! no offense to those places but this is much better in my opinion ! i 've had their tacos and just recently the chicken fajita combo ... yum ! love the rice too !
mexican	large restaurant with a bar , cool art on the walls along with some old school posters . my dad took me here , said it was one of the best older mexican joints here in vegas . he swears by the menudo here , cant get enough . full range of dishes to choose from and the horchata is on tap !
mexican	we are huge mexican food fans . my husband is very picky ( in a good way ) about his salsa and he has never been disappointed when we have gone here . the hubs typically orders the chicken fajitas and i get the al pastor tacos ... both are so tasty ! service is great , no complaints there .
mexican	great authentic food , service is great always coming by to ask about refills on drinks or tortilla chips . the home made salsa & guacamole are great !
mexican	been here a few times and have yet to write a review well here it is ... the food is delicious and the sangria superb ... enjoyed dinner tonight and each and every time i go here i enjoy the food , drinks and cozy atmosphere ... oh i almost forgot on saturday nights the live music is really nice .
mexican	i 'm not sure if they still give those la carnita ( screenprinted ? ) cards , but those were totally awesome. i got the the first time i went there sometime early 2013. i also love going here for late dinners ( around 9 or 10pm ) , cause i usually get off work after the ~ regular rush hour period. there 's usually little to no waiting time around this time on a weekday , so that 's a definite plus for me .
mexican	i usually don 't like fish , but i always find myself here when in the mood for tacos . it 's almost mesmerizing watching them make them with fresh ingredients ! my favourite is the black pepper marlin , but you can 't really go wrong with any choice . don 't forget to add salsa-- really adds a kick ! a cup of their fresh juice can always counter the spice .
mexican	the tacos are reasonably priced and reasonably sized . i love that they have such a big variety of tacos to choose from . they have a corn appetizer that is delicious . can 't go without getting a jalapeno margarita ! ! !
mexican	if you like menudo you 'll like the sopa de pata . i give all the credit to my girlfriend for introducing me to this place . i owe her big time . yummy yummy for the tummy .
mexican	super fast service as well ! ! i love it !
mexican	great menu options and amazing staff members that made it memorable . thanks to our waiter juan who entertained us !
mexican	they have the best pork in the valley hands down . great ambiance and a sexy waitress lol .
mexican	the place was busy for lunch on a saturday but it seemed a bit out of sorts dirty . food leftover on tables and on the floor , out of napkins . maybe just the lunchtime rush , i 'll have to give it another go and see what i think .
mexican	i 've had several items on the menu and all are tasty for your standard mexican american fare . great margs too ! service is usually very good , rarely have to wait for a table .
mexican	consistently pretty good . both chicken and steak . would like to see them offer a red salsa for their chips n salsa rather than only a green one .
mexican	food is authentic , fresh , flavorful & quality ! ! service is excellent ! and the restaurant is very nice , spacious and clean . good music & great vibe . tacos are my favorite . if you want mexican food in vegas come here without a doubt .
mexican	my wife and i love the cheese bean dip and the salsa . the staff is always friendly and the restaurant is very clean .
mexican	it 's s taco bell so expectations aren 't super high , i would say this one is average for fast food , reasonably clean and average service . there are a few please food joints that kill it and a ton of them that are disgusting ... this one is average or a tick above .
mexican	the risottos are delicious ! we usually get a lamb or beef dish as well and have not been disappointed . will definitely order here again , but sparingly as it is a bit on the pricey side .
mexican	got the steak tacos . i don 't know if they had it on the menu at the time but i asked for a bean and cheese burrito as my gf is vegetarian . without any delay he threw a tortilla on the stove top and said he can make one . service is exceptional food is good too . i 'd prob go there a lot more if they offered chicken as i don 't eat red meat too often .
mexican	been here a few times great little hidden place beautiful atmosphere great food fast service
mexican	it 's really good ! much better than baja taco which declined fast ! try the nacho burrito ! friendly staff .
mexican	love this place ! the food is delicious , the service is great , the portions are more then i can eat . all the margaritas look amazing , i 'm going to have to try one on our next visit . we ordered the nachos with chicken and they were perfect ! soooo cheesy and yummy .
mexican	great patio to sit outside when the weather is nice and enjoy the view . service is always fantastic . however ... i have to mention my fajitas the other night ... o m g ... i don 't consider myself an expert on proper fajitas ... i just know when they 're done wrong - they 're really wrong . these were incredibly delicious ! i shared a small taste with my dining companion .... he agreed that they were awesome ! i don 't know what they did .. but i do promise - i 'll be back again and again and again . headed over tonight to a 4 course meal and tasting hosted by herradura tequila ... i can 't wait !
mexican	our new favorite place in vegas for mexican food . they are known for fajitas but everything is good .
mexican	there is usually a line up , but things move quickly . we were standing outside for a few minutes until a table for two was cleared . everyone ahead of us was a party of 4 or more . anyhow , i had the huevos migas and it was unbelievable . so many delicious flavours and the portion was great ! i love the beet ginger juice . this place may not be the best for kids or very large groups .
mexican	4 different salsas come to your table when you first get there , all 4 are great my personal favorite is the green ( jalapeño ) . the tacos are phenomenal , traditional mexican tacos simply made in a soft tortilla with choice of meat , onions and cilantro . chimichangas are definitely worth a try as well ! quaint place inside , friendly staff !
mexican	big fan of the tacos they are absolutely delicious . plenty of cocktail choices . the chips and salsa are excellent . on top of all the good food and drink it has a really comfortable atmosphere . you also get to see the kitchen crew put your good eats together in the back . thank god my son lives right next to this place . it makes it easy to come back taste the love as often as i like .
mexican	the fish , chicken or carne asada taco is a great choice as is the shrimp nachos . but if your looking for something really special go with the filet mignon nachos , they are a real treat . also tequila tuesday are great , gives you a chance to try all kinds of different tequilas . service is good , but not always consistent . most of the servers are great but like anywhere there are always a few that throw the others off . over all i really like this place and look forward to the next visit !
mexican	both for dinner and breakfast . the chili relleno has to be about the best i 've had , and as a native phoenician , i 've had a bunch . they 're baked , not fried . they might get a little higher rating if their salsa was a little better . i 'm sorta picky on salsa . the service is always terrific .
mexican	i 'll have to come back for dinner one of these days , i heard its just as amazing . mmmm .
mexican	sides of plantains and yuca fries are exceptional too . expect to wait for takeout where not fast food , but tastes better than " fast food . "
mexican	service is excellent ! consistent quality and quantity . best mexican food experience next to home cooked . reccomend the carnitas coca-cola , tableside guacamole app , and cadilac margaritas !
mexican	they can miss things once in a while so just be sure to check your order in the drive thru ( as i would recommend with any fast food restaurant ! )
mexican	sometimes the food is spot on and delicious and sometimes not so much . the apps are always good and so are the desserts . main dishes especially the steak is always leather like and very hard to digest . chicken , soups and breakfast items have always been tasty . we 've been here a few times and enjoy most of our meals . as a non spanish speaker we try different stuff and some of it might simply not be the flavor and preparation we 're used to .
mexican	it is country ( hence the name ) but still some mexican items on the menu . i prefer it for breakfast because their muchacas are pretty good , especially for like $ 5 ! i eat one & take the rest home for my boys for an after-school snack . the food is good , the service is fast ( without making you feel hurried ) and the inside is very clean . i tried to go here last saturday for breakfast & there wasn 't a parking spot in site ! i am glad to see this place doing so well !
mexican	they remodeled the inside of the restaurant but the food still taste great . usually come here as i wait for discount tires to get done working on my car next door
mexican	very convenient location to my home . love their torta 's , however the fact that they come with ruffle chips is a little strange . on some of the larger tortas you could probably get away with splitting the meal , or bringing it home with you . salsa is spicier than many other americanized mexican food restaurants , which is an added plus . at the end of the meal they give you a dum dum lollipop . only gripe would be the fact that their margaritas are non alcoholic . they should really splurge on getting that liquor license .
mexican	although not to authentic , ive enjoyed all my meals there . never has superb service .
mexican	we typically go for the appetizer skewers which are both delicious and well priced . the drinks are just ok although the bartender will and have remade our drinks to our specifications so try their drinks . we live in noda and our friends in plaza midwood so we frequent here often . definitely worth trying out .
mexican	worth the wait ! the tacos are delicious and the staff is very friendly ! great prices for what you get ! love supporting local !
mexican	close to my gym and easy in and out food . i always get the chips and guacamole to go either my burrito bowl . its a nice pairing . if you 're looking for a post workout meal thisbis the ticket . they messed up my order one time , but no one is perfect . other than that the service has always been great . i always use the app to order to skip the line . it saves your info too to make it easy .
mexican	their quesadillas are not like any quesadilla i 've ever had ; all of their tacos are delicious , they have a huge salsa bar , and the best horchata i 've ever had . i 'll def keep coming back .
mexican	portions are huge , you get to customize exactly what you want your burrito to be , and the price isn 't too expensive .
mexican	my kids love it and the food is good , if anything toooo much food , lol . but there is no complaining since the prices are always reasonable . the margaritas are good , the drinks in general are good and very reasonably priced . the staff is always nice , helpful , etc . and the food comes out very quickly . all in all , it is a win .
mexican	service is always good , the food and drinks are always tasty , ambiance is kick back , today ( sunday late afternoon ) they had a two- man band that is awesome to listen to , and it 's never over- crowded or too loud like their sister restaurant , gallo blanco . you can 't go wrong with their menu , it 's simple to understand and well thought out ! a must try !
mexican	every time the food has been good-outstanding . service timely and friendly . fair prices . nice outdoor patio . def gives cozumel a run for their $ . will be back ( soon , hopefully : )
mexican	so this was easy for me to update my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars ! i still love my tacos but my wife recently had the argentine steak quesadilla and it was amazing ! ! it was very big .. big enough for us to easily share . on our last visit we didn 't share but ended up taking the other half home and have an amazing snack ! overall service isn 't the fastest , but i 'll wait a little for food so good . nice local restaurant in glendale !
mexican	the trashcan nachos are delicious and the staff is fabulous .
mexican	food is tasty but portions are a bit on the smaller side . still one of the better local ethnic eateries in las vegas . don 't let the somewhat suspect surroundings of this place dissuade you from stopping . good service . mint & green chili with chicken was very good .
mexican	so much that i had to buy the sauce . the tacos come out crispy . they are consistant on my visits . went on taco day $ 1 . tad skimp but i 'm bias cause i 'm from # texas . but still flavorful . # thatsauce tho .
mexican	great homemade food . ordered the carne asada . tastes just like my moms cooking . quick and friendly service . would definitely come again .
mexican	been here before it was good back then and its good now ..... they accept credit / debit cards now with a $ .50 fee which is a ok wif me ..... nom nom nom .... lol
mexican	the service spot on the food was great ... the carnitas reminded me ol town san diego crispy on the outside and soft and flavorful on the inside .... horchata out the gun ok was still good la mojara was great and the tortillas hecha a mano was a good touch also simple but a big reminder of my grandma ( chichi ) cooking fideo soup next time i would like to come down for cinco de mayo and hear some marachis ...
mexican	did the taco platter both times as it is a great way to sample different foods . my favorites were the basically any of the pork tacos . had the table side guacamole a well which was pretty good . lastly , sitting on the patio this time of year is awesome .
mexican	there are simply no better tacos in pittsburgh , not even close . i 've pretty much had every taco that he 's had available on the menu . from venison to steak kimchi and everything in between , each one has been fantastic . living on the north side of town doesn 't offer many culinary advantages , but the fact that the coffee buddha is home to the taco truck makes up for them all . without any hyperbole , this is my favorite place to get food from in pittsburgh . tacos rule .
mexican	staff / owner very welcoming will keep coming back ... thanks senor pizza
mexican	but that is based on a opinion that has only had taco bell and chipotle to compare .
mexican	cool clean atmosphere great for happy hour or a date also if your at the pool they will bring it out to you . decently prices for what your getting . this hotel and resturaunt is a great gem of downtown
mexican	the criticism about not being able to order different tacos on the taco plate is valid - why do i want three of the same kind when there are all these amazing kinds to choose from ? ? at lunch with a couple of people ? order three different tacos and share - this is what we did for my last lunch and we all had a variety of tacos and all were good . the fried fish and crane asada were borderline great . quick , easy and tasty .
mexican	the mole sauce is very good , i usually get that with chicken . sometimes it can be a little off with the sauce to meat ratio ends up turning into a soup , but for the most part consistently tasty . the service is always good , even when i 've gone with big groups the waitresses take orders correctly and are prompt with bringing drinks / refills / chips .
mexican	enjoyed 2 $ tacos and 5 $ margaritas . the bartenders andrew and omar were super nice . we will definitely come back , the food was great and the service excellent .
mexican	well priced , fresh ingredients , fast service and large portions . can 't go wrong !
mexican	if you 've been to havana the cuban food here is on a at or better . the service is great as well . highly recommend the ropa viaja . amazing meat plate
mexican	been here many many times every body i have ever brought has loved it here and they have came back best tacos and i 'm mexican so i should lol
mexican	the portion they give if very generous . the price is pretty good for the portion they give . my favorite is the fried chicken avocado burrito . i recommend come early as it tends to get busy .
mexican	i bring friends and family here too . the guacamole and the elote are a must have each time i come . there isn 't a bad item on the menu and the ingredients very fresh , however .... the only thing we tapatios cannot figure out is why no little botanas like chips and salsa while you are waiting for your meal . we came for sunday breakfast and the chorizo and eggs came with three tiny tortillas . though delicious , a little stingy , no ? a little more mexican hospitality , which is what we are best known for , does not cost much .
mexican	they are slow compared to other taco bells but food is decent .
mexican	definitely one of my favorite places to eat on the west side of cleveland . the food is spectacular and the fact that it is byob only makes it better . the tostones with guac is my favorite . arepas are great and i haven 't had a bad meal yet . so affordable and a great menu .
mexican	food is always good , and never disappoints . the tableside guac is a must . i 've found that the guac is a little better in the winter seasons , when they add pomegranate seeds in with the avocado- it 's amazing . service here is just basic ... nothing special there- but they get the job done .
mexican	food is consistently good . service is always excellent . salsa and chips with bean dip always satisfying .
mexican	they have la case azul tequila repasado very resonably priced compared to the strip . i hated the mexican restaurant at red rock before so glad they have a good one now . i will be back often . they change the menu frequently but don 't worry if you have a favorite because you will find another one . all food is amazeing . please write positive reviews for others in hopes of spreading positive energy . pay it forward please staff
mexican	richardson 's is positively one of our favorites . you can 't go wrong with anything on the menu . the carne adovada is the best . it just melts in your mouth . all of the fish entrees are fantastic ! sea bass is over the top . great wine selection . very friendly staff , always great service . all i can say is give this place a try , it won 't disappoint . they also have great happy hour deal , which is a great way to try different things in the menu .
mexican	yes - check it out . only qualm - one vegetarian option . the price has gone up . also that one big chunk of cheese hard to eat when eating tacos sometimes . wish the space was bigger . but , since the tacos are so successful , i doubt they will change this . the hottest sauce - is hot . so don 't ruin your taco and avoid or put a tiny bit on the side so you can control it if you 've never tried .
mexican	their c / asada fries are to die for ! it costs $ 8.76 at the moment . they are open 24 hours ! inside cleanliness is decent but is comparable to taco 's el gordo . overall good taco shop on the east side !
mexican	all the items are fresh and taste great when all put together . lunch time can get very busy but line ups move quickly . the only downside to this place is it can get very pricey and cost you about $ 15 each time .
mexican	also they accompany the meal with pickled carrots , onions , etc . which is almost a side dish . overall very happy with the consistent quality here .
mexican	service can be a little slow at times , but that can happen to any small place . prices are great for the quality . meats are amazingly juicy and full of flavor . can 't ask for any better food . come here now if you haven 't yet .
mexican	i usually get either fire grilled steak burrito or i get the fire grilled chicken one . i love it enchilada style with spicy sauce is bomb . service is always good people are friendly . i have not been dissapointed ever in going here . i highly reccomend
mexican	the decor is snazzy and the room feels very open and festive , plus it has a terrific location right off the aria registration desk . the bar area is very large and the bar staff has always been spot-on . the menu is extensive and has terrific variety . favorites are the albondigas ( spanish meatballs ) , the grilled octopus on solid potato cakes , and the cheese selection . everything is colorfully presented and plated . i 'm a particular fan of the white sangria , which is refreshing rather than heavy and overly sweet . it 's certainly not cheap , but given the quality and the setting , it 's worth it for a vegas splurge .
mexican	very good food . employees are great . there was a day when i came in 10 minutes before close and i was getting a bowl and i got a phone call that my house was flooding and the lady at the counter waa talking to me at the same time the person on the phone was . so i put my hand up to like gesture her to give me a second and i felt so rude . but she did not be rude to me she stayed nice . i apologized after i 've never done that i felt terrible but she 's the reason i 'm giving t stars
mexican	a go to spot . not sue how they treat workers but food is good and consistent . service varies but i 'm a late hours person , so ....
mexican	love the chips and salsa as well ... it 's nice and spicy as it should be .
mexican	really enjoyed it and love that it 's conveniently located close to where i live . prices are average , lots of seating , and nice decor .
mexican	just tried the mole fries and this place jumped to the top of my " best fast mexican food spot " list . thank you taco y taco for bringing something completely different !
mexican	food was good and price was right . we can recommend the tamales . it 's a small , family-type restaurant , byob . nothing fancy but you 'll get a good , authentic-tasting mexican meal here .
mexican	my girlfriend had the fish option , which i had a bite of and let 's just say that 's what i would order the next time i go . wish there was a bit more seating , but i 'll excuse it because the portion size is generous .
mexican	best . fish tacos . ever . fish delicious , grilled , fresh , and plenty of it . fresh , good hawaiian beer on tap . superb customer service . they have one other restaurant in maui , rated best restaurant in maui and # 1 fish tacos in the usa . i agree with the rating .
mexican	) , good location and reasonably priced . we 'll be back .
mexican	the meat is nicely seasoned and almost melts in your mouth . at first you 're annoyed because this place only takes cash and there 's no friggin place to sit . but once you manage to score an empty bench ( or an actual seat ) - all annoyances are gone and the tacos are like envelopes of love from your favourite grandma ( minus the cash and grandma ) . tacos are packed and overflowing , so you might wanna grab a fork or two before you chow down
mexican	my go-to for quality mexican food at a great price with very friendly staff . favorite dishes : enchilada supreme and vegetarian mushroom enchilada . food comes out quickly and they serve the best rice i 've had ! guacamole is also very fresh .
mexican	they 've always been fresh and tasty , though a bit pricey for the amount you get .
mexican	best tacos in town and maybe in il . this place is a much . the guacamole is superb and you get a large helping . staff was friendly ( as always ) . prices were fair and make me feel like it 's about quality over making bank . the food is authentic and fresh . if you just visiting or just in lunch break ... go here .
mexican	better carne asada than your typical federico 's or filebertos . ground beef tacos solid too . get those on a tuesday .. only $ 1 each . staffs friendly and food is good .. would recommend .
mexican	we had great food , great service , good sangria , and live music . couldn 't ask for more . perfect for a dinner / night out .
mexican	so many times i can 't remember . the sangria is amazing the tapas are absolutely delicious ! ! ! must try the sliders or anything ! ! ! we love it all ! ! ! service is great ! ! ! ! !
mexican	it never fails that they say , i " ll be back !
mexican	food is as good as typical chili 's gets . i will continue to come .
mexican	had to write a review on my last visit . i came in from working all day in the yard and was quite thirsty . i ordered an arnold palmer for my drink , which was mixed perfectly . anytime that glass was emtpy , it didn 't take long for it to be refilled perfect every time . we have an abundance of mexican to choose from now , but this place is in a class of it 's own .
mexican	had the steak fajitas . very good . the frozen sangria is not to be missed . also , happy hour has a good selection of appetizers and drinks . service is consistently good .
mexican	when my inlaws came to visit , we ate here . they said everything was great , and the best salsa , i agree . we each had a dish , then mom asked for fried ice cream ... it.was.huge ! 4 of us shared it , and there was some left over . we even had two togo boxes filled with leftovers .
mexican	the chips , salsa and bean dip here are to die for . you can probably just order an appetizer and the chips , you are good to go . their combo for two people is a good deal . for $ 25 , you get their famous flaming fajitas ( choose from chicken , beef , pork and shrimp ) , rice , refried beans , pico de gallo , guacamole and a soup . the service here was also great . fast and very attentive . this is one of my go to places now for mexican food .
mexican	the veggie tacos are my favorite thing on the menu . i am not a vegetarian , but these are seriously good . chips are hot and fresh , salsa is great- green is a bit sweet and red is just right .
mexican	friendly , quick service . great atmosphere . decent prices . i love firefly . update : i 've been here many times now . everyone i take here loves it . every meal i get is great . the only issue is that it is packed on a friday night . it 's awesome .
mexican	the only complaint would be the service has been a little slow ( not enough to stop me from growing back ) . great selection of food and beer . prices are great too ( half price beer for happy hour ) . i 've tried most of the tacos on the menu and my favorites have been chicken tinga & puerco verde . their guacamole , corn salad , and cilantro lime rice are great too .
mexican	i love their chips and salsa to start and good to start with the cervesa . i 've brought friends and co-workers here and they never fail . employees are great and you can tell they 're all hard workers . this place never fail ! ! ! just finished late lunch with my mom and brother with my family ... everyone was at awe how good the food was and he amount that was served . i love the way we 're always checked and made sure we have everything .... great employees that 's why this place is great . this place have such great employees as great assets .
mexican	i had some very tasty enchiladas and some great nachos . definitely better than filibertos .
mexican	i 'm a fajitas junkie and tend to order that dish wherever i go , from la to texas . i 'm impressed with the steak and chicken combo here . my wife had the korean bbq and mahi-mahi tacos ... really enjoyed them . try the tahona margarita , super ! we 've been impressed with the excellent service we 've had for all our visits . sandi was our server last night and was just excellent . we 'll be back !
mexican	tried others but always come back to jaburrito . i always make a point in trying different ones but so far the redondo is one of my favorites but you can always customize your meal too- staff is always friendly and make a point at stopping at your table to make sure everthing is to your liking .
mexican	i always love the food and so worth all the little qwerks of a small mom and pop restaurant . i wish they still served breakfast burritos all day . it seems like every time i go there , they are closing a little earlier . and it 's not uncommon for them to start closing up 30-minutes before the actual closing time , so plan ahead . if you call 15-minutes before they close , good luck getting someone to answer . would totally go 5 stars if not for those little things .
mexican	if you don 't speack spanish you 'll need interpreter for most of the guys behind the counter . got the ribs today wasn 't impressed , but the rest of the food there is good . make sure you stop by as the have a meat market ans speciality mexican food .
mexican	food is decent . i like the hibiscus soda and brunch items . satisfies that tex-mex craving . service has been very slow every time i 've been , but i didn 't mind because i wanted to relax with friends . the cornbread , frozen chambord margarita and ancho chile pie are not to be missed . i mean it ! don 't miss it !
mexican	pretty good food . the setting on the inside seems a little cheap , but it is what it is . a simple little mexican joint to get your mexican food fill . if they only served beer ! lol
mexican	i 've tried some of their margaritas ... and they 're all good ! as for the food , i 've had their catfish beignets , grilled shrimp and guac tostada bites , street tacos , these dumplings ... which were amazing ! ! ( thanks to our waiter 's recommendation ) and probably some more that i can 't remember . the cornbread is amazing ! ! ! ! i would honestly eat the whole thing if i didn 't remember that i actually ordered food . but yes , great food , and the waiters i had here were all so nice , making great conversation , offering suggestions , and always making sure we were taken care of .
mexican	service was very personable and excellent by chef carlos . the last time i visited , he was not there , sorry to see this , his recommendations and enthusiasm for the cuisine is deeply missed . also , hours are very limited now .
mexican	hasn 't let me down yet . it 's easily accessible off boulder highway and is open 24 / 7 . this is one of my preferred spots to redeem the bogo coupon for the double del cheeseburger , $ 3.00 each , and i don 't recall having any issues . they also aren 't upselling jerks who pester you about trying a new item or asking 3 times whether you 're sure that you 've concluded your order .
mexican	i don 't care what kind of meat i get since i like them all , even the sweet one , it 's always been good and tasty . not once have i been disappointed weather i eat there or take it to eat at home . when i like a place i go back over and over . so , see you soon guys , i 'm almost ready for another burrito . * oh and your yerba buena lemonade is the bomb .
mexican	the menu is a little fancier than i 'd normally go for ( i 'm a pretty picky eater ) but i usually go for the beef taco lunch special with fried plantains on the side . their puréed habanero sauce always hits the spot for me . still trying to make it here to try the dinner menu ( and drinks that i can 't have while working ) at some point .
mexican	love the menudo on the weekends ! the girls upfront always have a smile . surf and turf is a great one too !
mexican	best tortilla soup in the se valley ! the place can stand some repairs , like the booths are torn and the walls could use a coat of paint . but if you are in it for the food , you won 't be disappointed !
mexican	no difference . good izakaya type food . tip : get the okonomoyaki and takoyaki .
mexican	always order the frozen ritas .... they are good and strong ! if you need to find a great place to take kids this is it .... very relaxed outside seating with plenty of animals to keep them entertained . they get to feed the ducks in a designated area as well . service can be hit or miss so can 't be in a hurry .
mexican	i 've never seen this place without a line . it 's home-made goodness at its best ! enough said ! i could drink the hot sauce ... omg it makes me drool .... elmer 's is the family owned and operated place you wanna get your mexican food from ! you can 't go wrong with anything on the menu ! my personal fav is the taco and chimi combo with decedent rice and beans . but a pint of their sauce . you 'll be drinking it too it 's so delicious !
mexican	love the owners , truly amazing . try the pozole , the best ever . all of the food is awesome ! oh wait , beerita is so flavorful . gotta try !
mexican	been here so many times this place is amazing usually catching lunch though lol been coming for dinner been great
mexican	today they didn 't have carnitas so that sucked but they are amazing and the time and the price is legit amazing . must go .
mexican	best mexican vibe for a non mexican city and superb food . always leave feeling like i am pregnant with a mexican child after eating too much as its so good !
mexican	in a world of mediocre wait staff you will not find that here . ( we feel like there 's a parade in our honor every time we walk through the door ! ) the fresh margarita is yummy , and my go-to dish is the pollo con crema . while don pedro 's might not be the most authentic mexican fare , it 's pretty inexpensive . you 'll eat till you explode and still have plenty left for the takeout box . and the super friendly staff will point you to some of the more obscure mexican bakeries , etc. in charlotte . and if they recommend them , i 'm on it .
mexican	tons on the menu but i have always ordered the chile releno and chicken enchilada . chips are great and the salsa has a big bite . there is a reason the parking lot is always full at lunch time !
mexican	they listen to what you want and they 're friendly and courteous .
mexican	always very clean and the staff and owner are always very kind . please give them a try , well worth it ! !
mexican	the service was great and i really love the authentic mexican recipes and the abundance of seafood choices like several shrimp dishes and crab legs . recently i 've had the chile relleno and tacos al carbon--all delicious with general portions . previously i had the tacos al pastor which were great , it 's tough to find good al pastor in the chandler or phoenix areas . i look forward to coming for happy hour soon and having the nachos deluxe--tip : if you like your salsa hot , ask for the green hot salsa made with habanero chilis--its fire !
mexican	service has always been great ! ! food is plentiful and tasty . be sure to watch the bus boys clean and set the tables .... amazingly fast and they look like they 're having fun while they do it .
mexican	the salsas add a lot of variety to the flavors and textures of the food . will definitely come back and recommend to friends !
mexican	ask for a small portion because they are still huge and are plenty big enough to share ! $ 5 is the entry price . adobada / al pastor is the best thing ever in case you didn 't know already ! slightly spicy marinated pork with all the goodies ! you 'll never want to eat carne asada again lol
mexican	fusion texmex fare . the grilled steak carne asada tacos with carmelized onions were good but the sauteed mushrooms were out of this world and were only $ 6 . it was crowded and busy so the staff did their best considering . the limeade was great . the second one was even better !
mexican	after maintaining weight before a comp , this place is perfect to stuff your face . lol . nice looking on the inside . nice decor . food is flavorful , tasty and sustainably raised which means all meat is pesticide , antibiotic and steroid free . looking forward to visiting next year when back in vegas .
mexican	both times i ordered to-go . i 've had the carnitas , pork belly , barbacoa , korean kalbi , carne asada , and fish tacos . i also like to get the tator tots ( comes with sour cream , cheese , and a big scoop of guacamole ) . i highly recommend this place and will be back to try the rest of the menu ! i have my eye on the churros next !
mexican	champagne sampler and the rosarito . great start to a sunday morning
mexican	noisy but that 's because it is so good and busy . definitely going back !
mexican	both were excellent . i want this place to succeed .
mexican	not the best mexican i 've ever had in my life but it is still pretty darn good . their margaritas are on par here . most of their dishes i liked , especially their enchiladas . my husband liked their fajitas and carne asada chimichungas . not a huge fan of their tacos however .
mexican	server were very attentive . first time we went there was at night it was busy but they managed it well got our orders and it was correct and taste good . yesterday we went there on happy hour . less people and i noticed how nice the place is . it is luke you are in mexico hehehe . service was awesome and the food and drink was great ! yes we will comeback again and again !
mexican	both times the food was good and filling . tonight there was an issue and the cashier kindly told me it would be a 15 minute wait for any food to make sure i had time to make my flight . i always appreciate honesty . ordered something o could eat on the go , and it was really good .
mexican	both times were good . the salsa trio is tasty . menu features seasonal selections as well as mainstays . great tacos ! some of the best in cleveland . the argentinian platter is a plethora of meaty goodness . if you like meat and are famished go with this .
mexican	salsa was super tasty ! roll taco was my favorites
mexican	chips and salsa are good ! first time i had the chilean sea bass tacos ... yummy but a bit too spicy for my taste buds ! nonetheless , it was still flavorful ! today i had the steak tacos ... yummers ! ! love the decor ! friendly & quick service ! kind of pricey for mexican food ... but it 's worth it !
mexican	can 't wait to bring my wife back here for dinner ....... gracious , hospitable owners in the old world tradition !
mexican	fun environment , but the music is a bit too loud for easy conversation . nice people working there . fish tacos - mahi mahi grilled nicely . but too much sauce . i recommend ordering without any sauce . big servings , so go easy on the sides , and please think twice about a 3rd taco . salads - are big with fresh ingredients . plenty of options here .... but ask for dressing on the side . they treat salad bowls like swimming pools for veggies . salsa bar is nice , but the salsas lack flavor , just adds moisture .
mexican	tacos are amazing some of the best in the city . the nacho dip set is really good . they give you a selection of 4 hot sauces on your table so never a dull nacho chip . micheladas are decent too . margaritas are top notch .
mexican	great service . negra modelo on tap . chorizo tacos and quesadilla were perfect . my wife had tasty fish tacos . beers , tacos and dilla ' for $ 22 . i 'll be a regular here as its walkable . i 'll still occasionally pickup a green chile burrito at nearby los taquitos , but escobar 's is my # 1 .
mexican	been here twice has really friendly employees the food is nice the drinks are delicious
mexican	much better food and service than several years ago . we had combination plates with enchiladas , tacos , tamales , rice and black beans ; and burritos too . all food was fresh and served hot . kids menu has lots of choices and both my kids like eating here . sundays and mondays in may the entire menu is half off so expect a little bit ( 10-20 mins ) of a wait .
mexican	the employees are very friendly . when you walk in , you are greeted right away . the place will customize your hot dog exactly how you want it . one thing to point out , they also serve delicious tacos ! however , you would never know because the menu board with the tacos is located behind you and not next to the hot dog menu . the food arrives pretty quickly . the place is very clean too . you not want to bring your kids here because the music they are playing is mostly from tu-pac ( rip ) and his lyrics are a little raunchy . i hope this place keeps up the good work . i 'll keep returning if they do !
mexican	the fish taco and full taco are spectacular , and the refreshing aguas frescas make the perfect beverage to accompany these delights . the tacos are " plain " when handed to you ; from there you dress it up with the freshest toppings and salsas from the toppings bar ; my favorite topping combination is their creamy slaw with the pickled red onions and jalapeños . service is fast and friendly , there 's a cool patio area , and free wifi is always a good thing .
mexican	recommending to everyone i know . had a burrito bowl with rice and black beans both times with the carne asada . fiancé got street taco 's and loves carne asada but got 2 other meats too and she loved the others more than the carne so that says a lot to me . also , the churro 's are great and come with caramel dipping sauce , so that 's always a plus ! !
mexican	loved it both times ! ! ! i always love tapas as i get the courage to try things i wouldn 't normally order a full portion of . some things i loved , some not so much but the food was all well made . the service here is also fantastic . it 's great for hanging out with girlfriends or for a date .
mexican	definitely my new favorite . a unique mix of chipotle and rubio 's but fresher than both and without the " chain " feel . great variety of flavors and toppings on the create-your-own . all of the staff have been super helpful and attentive . can 't wait to come back !
mexican	try the raspberry or blackberry ... heck , try them both ! they are this amazing combination of tart , sweet , and refreshing . i can 't think of a better way to beat the vegas heat than cañonita 's mojitos !
mexican	loved it more the second time . sure it 's a bit pricey for tapas but the dishes are great . the seating area in the front has views of the hotel / casino which are fun but if you want more privacy and tranquility sit in the back - you forget you 're in a casino . calamari a la plancha has to be one of the best tasting things i 've ever had in my life - no exaggeration . the chorizo is way too spicy so be wary . white sangria is refreshing . usually you can get a seat , no problem .
mexican	love it ! minus one star because the place is a tad bit dirty . staff is nice overall and pleasant . parking is tricky though . luckily , the bland st light rail stop is a short distance away . a must go spot !
mexican	service has been very good both times and they have a nice outdoor patio area . chips and homemade salsa are a great way to start . the corn chowder is great as a lunch alone or just a cup with something else from the menu . our table tried a variety of menu items and everyone enjoyed their meal . will definitely go back again .
mexican	the employees are personable and really make the experience enjoyable and beyond satisfying ! they 're quick and on top of things . the food is super tasty and arrives fresh and hot . i 've had the seafood enchilada and the spinach enchilada and i 'm looking forward to trying more of their options . and if you 're looking for a great margarita , get it here ! it 's a nice atmosphere with comfortable dim lighting and decor . overall , manuel 's has given me one of the best experiences i 've ever had at a restaurant .
mexican	first i tried the carne asada torta with bacon added and a side of fries , yesterday tried the carne asada burrito with a side of guacamole and chips . their carne is delicious , perfectly seasoned and good quality . the guacamole was great . their chips are really thick and crunchy with salt but are also great . i would skip the fries and go for the chips , though . also got coffee both times and it comes in a little single serve french press you press yourself so you can let it brew as long as you want , which is awesome . i wish there were refills ! decent prices with good service and a nice atmosphere . recommended .
mexican	i had the breakfast burrito supreme this morning and the pork was tender and flavorful . a lot of food for nine bucks .
mexican	i recommend the strips and anything machaca with red sauce . the green is actually spicier here lol . great job guys !
mexican	the first time , i had just two sides of grilled veggies and a vegan cookie ; today i had the sweet potato quesadilla sans fromage. it was magnificent. friendly staff , relaxed ambience , great prices. i 'll be back .
mexican	the food is fantastic and so are the margaritas ! ! bathroom not very clean but that 's about it .
mexican	two of the best mojitos i 've ever had . the cocktails are definitely worth ordering . the food , same category . i 've tried 4 different dishes off the menu and they were all fantastic . great service , even when it was super busy . try it !
mexican	the food is delicious , the set up is really relaxing and service is great . a great place to take an out of town guest . happy hour menu has these amazing tofu tacos that i highly recommend . my boyfriend had the pork tacos which he said were also delish . definitely check this place out ! !
mexican	first time shells were a little hard but edible . this time i asked for softer ones and wow they did them perfect . very nice , good food , and accommodations . great place
mexican	my 16yr old son loves their tacos . margaritas are so so ... depends on who is making them . salsa is great . fillings on the tacos are a lil skimpy but i guess thats what you get for 99c tacos on tuesday . planning to go back on a weds for their $ 2 enchilladas .
mexican	i was given a free guacamole coupon at the nearby hyatt place ( ask for one ! ) and so started with a free dish of table side guacamole ( 3 avacodo 's ) followed by taco 's with all the trimmings and two excellent margarita 's. then a free hyatt shuttle to a good night 's sleep !
mexican	i 've had better but overall really nice cool place to enjoy some nice mexican food .
mexican	love the nachos and the chimichanga . great tex mex style food with a korean kick . if i had one complain i wish they had a soda machine with refills . but even without that i had a blast .
mexican	think i have sampled a bit of everything . tried three different kind of tacos ( chicken , beef , and fish ) , a burro ( carne asada ) , and a quesadilla ( ground beef ) . everything was really good . the quesadilla is quite a bit different then other quesadillas i have had . much thicker . more like a stuffed gordita . was really good . small place . no wait was i was there , but i can easily see there being one . salsa bar is fantastic .
mexican	off the strip taco bar with great atmosphere . marissa the bartender delivered great service with a smile . grilled mahi fsh tacos were fresh and perfectly cooked . freshly made corn tortillas . great salsas and chips . im coming back for sure .
mexican	they have very friendly staff and fresh ingredients . salsas are on point and they provide free chips . quality spot
mexican	i think the food is excellent and the service is very much improved . good patio as well . i will for sure be going back .
mexican	service and food are really good . atmosphere is awesome as well ..... especially in the very back of the restaurant with windows open !
mexican	food was very good both times . corn on the cob was an excellent side ... an original recipe perfectly cooked .
mexican	tacos were delicious . hot sauce delivers .sipping some pacifico rn so i plan on going tonight and trying the carne asada quesadilla .
mexican	good sized portions , had a great quesadilla last time . really love the selection of both a ton of different hot sauces and also a variety of salsas ; keeps the food even more interesting ! also a really nice setup for the restaurant , very spacious inside and nice seating outside in good weather !
mexican	fish and shrimp tacos - fantastic ! green chili burrito is the best ! ! !
mexican	food is delicious . wait staff is super friendly . patio is amazing . can 't say enough .
mexican	the service is always friendly . the food is delicious .. best tamale ! casual atmosphere . very clean .
mexican	very good food . full bar . group friendly . live music . great service .
mexican	the ambiance is great and the food is pretty good too . i 'd definitely get the corn as a side to any meal whether it be tacos or another entree . i give it 4 stars because the food is pricey , but given its one of the better restaurants in the area i understand the price inflation .
mexican	the sign is a little obscure as we almost missed it the first time . the tacos were sooo good we want to come back everytime we go to downtown . tried the gobernator , baja fish , pulled pork , halibut , all good . the spiciest sauce was very spicy the fist time we tried . sweat was coming off the back of the head ... but the second time tasted milder ...
mexican	the sign is a little obscure as we almost missed it the first time . the tacos were sooo good we want to come back everytime we go to downtown . tried the gobernator , baja fish , pulled pork , halibut , all good . the spiciest sauce was very spicy the fist time we tried . sweat was coming off the back of the head ... but the second time tasted milder ... 5 bucks for a taco is not cheap but the ingredients quality n ample portion made up for it . one complaint , pulled pork was a tad over grilled but still tasty . can 't wait to go back again . yummy ! ! !
mexican	this is my new favorite place . if you ask for the owner 's recommendation , he will tell you about the two most popular dishes . both are incredible , but the second choice is what i urge you to choose . it is absolutely sublime . viva la taguara .
mexican	the food and service here is very good . i even gave a spanish lesson to a server. lol--- the chef is from mexico city so no tex mex here . great happy hour place with my girlies . rasberry habenero margarita for 5 bucks , yum ! seven dollar plates . yippee ! this is my second favorite mexican restaurant in town . the guac is good , yes but still not as good as gallo / otro . i will have to go here more often especially since they are right next door to an " anything bundt cakes . "
mexican	the tacos were delicious and the service was amazing . highly recommend it !
mexican	the server is very energetic , and i can tell this restaurant is under good management ! we ordered two order of tacos and some appetizer ( hard to remember their mexican name ) . the fish taco is crispy , and the pork belly taco is tender , but i don 't really enjoy their shrimp salad in a sour base ( feel not so fresh ) . we have been offered complimentary desert , it tastes like egg pudding with coconut ! i enjoy their ambience , and i think i will try them again in the future .
mexican	boy did i get my wish ! ! ! the food is wonderfully made . just the right amount of heat and a ton of flavor . highly recommend ! ! !
mexican	i 'll be coming back . 2 plates with the works and drinks for about 20 bucks .
mexican	well , hold up y 'all . found it . this place is authentic and delicious . absolutely loved it . i will be back .
mexican	this is the first place even close to the food in tucson .
mexican	my favourite is definitely blackened mahi tacos . my only beef with this place is the dining place which is very limited . however , this is a common issue with restaurants in the kensington market .
mexican	great service , flavor , and very well reasonably priced !
mexican	came here for lunch and was greeted by the owner who was super friendly and told us about his menu . we decided to try the tacos ( 3 for 10.99 ) and tortas and ordered some chips with guac . everything was super delicious . the chips were nice and very crispy . i ordered the chorizo , chicken , and carnita tacos . all were garnished and flavoured very well . the carnita torta was quite large but it was so good we were able to finish it all . the only regret i have is not trying the fish tacos . but that means ill be going back for them next time !
mexican	came here for lunch , and it wasn 't busy at all for being noon . got complimentary chips and salsa . the waiter helped us with ordering and even brought out some of the sauces for us to try . he recommended the enchiladas , so i order the chicken ones with green sauce . i was overall very impressed with them and so were my friends .
mexican	i gotta say this is my new hit that craving taco place . tortilla feel so fresh n can 't find anywhere else .
mexican	it 's quick service , fresh , and reasonably priced . also , they put a decent amount of meat on the tacos which is always nice . will definitely return when craving tacos in the area . it 's just a pop-up shop so there is no seating , either have to eat in your car or find a spot to squat to eat . also , parking in the area might be hard to find on a busy night .
mexican	the salsa , queso , and chimi are all very good , much better than azteca !
mexican	it didn 't disappoint . i am new to the vegan eating so this place was a much needed experience for me . i got the vegan chicken nachos . they were great . i miss nacho cheese but the vegan nacho cheese was pretty close and got the job done . bonus was checking in got my wife a free house margarita . only thing i could complain about would be the price but it 's vegas and it 's not a fast food restaurant so you can 't expect dollar menu prices . when i comeback to vegas i will love to comeback to eat .
mexican	these are the best tacos in town ! the home made wheat tortillas were excellent . also had the guacamole prepared at the table . will definitely be back when i get the itch for some tacos .
mexican	well i was wrong ! i ordered a plate that included braised cuban beef , fried chicharron , beans , rice , salad and plantain two ways . it was a huge portion for 14 $ for dinner and 11 $ at lunch . it also comes with this very delicious salsa which is just a touch spicy but more on the flavorful side . everything was excellent and i felt extremely satisfied by the end . cant believe i didnt try it sooner ! i will be a regular here for sure ! highly recommend !
mexican	so glad we finally did ! great food for a great price and so many options ! you can mix up the fillings or get extra on the side for only a buck . the chicken was juicy and delicious . we will be back ... and soon !
mexican	finally ! i remembered and tried this place . i was starving when i went and wanted to order everything . i got menudo which was just ok . it was kinda greasy and bland . i 've had better menudo . i didn 't finish it cause my tummy and grease don 't do well . i also got the ceviche pescado which was so flippin ' good ! ! only ate about half due to finishing off the chips and salsa and the fact that they give you so much . the ceviche is so fresh and packed full of flavor . can 't wait to go back and try more seafood items .
mexican	i don 't eat meat , so of course i went veggie . the colombian with pineapples , cheese , jalapeños and yes , crushed potato chips was outrageous . now i have to work my way through the rest of the menu . will be back !
mexican	never had an arepa prior to tonight . i 'm hooked ! besides being fantastically good tasting the service was outstanding . very friendly , at least three different staff members said hello from the kitchen behind the counter . gentleman at the register explained what everything was without being too wordy or over the top . will be back soon !
mexican	dated a peruvian for over 5 years and been in peru many times . this place is not your run of the mill peruvian spot . authentic food with a gourmet touch . look forward to returning
mexican	awesome customer service , greeted right as we walked in the door . tasty tacos and delicious beans . will be back for sure ! ! !
mexican	had the mexicana torta with asada , grilled onions , tomato and avocado . delicious ! with a grilled onion , cucumbers , radishes and lettuce on the side this makes a nice meal . will definitely be back to try others .
mexican	really don 't like location . it 's in that transition area from strip to downtown . also never having had this cuisine i was skeptical to say the least . walked in at a great time . no line . i got what i gathered from yelp as the good and was not disappointed . that wood kissed beef if flavorful on it own but the give you sauce . i prefer hot .
mexican	had the beef barbacoa tacos so good and the beans are not traditional but so good ! !
mexican	hubby had the green chili and loved it ! ! said it was the best he had had . .. hatch green chilies , nice and spicy ! i had the carne asada , which had a wonderful seasoning ! sooooooooooo yummy ! ! then we just had to split a traditional fry bread - honey and powdered sugar . served up hot , very hot and oh so yummy ! haven 't had one in many many years , and this was worth the wait ! omg ! ! ! amazing ! ! on way home , hubby couldn 't stop talking about the green chili - it was that good ! we will be back ! !
mexican	i 'm from los angles so i 'm really big on mexican food and things like asada fries . i ended up getting a regular chicken burrito with no cilantro and no onions . it was pretty good . next time i want to see what their asada fries are looking like !
mexican	service can be a little slow at times but the quality of the meals more than make up for that shortcoming . highly recommended .
mexican	one of the finest southwest cuisine restaurants in the country in my opinion . great menu , good service and absolutely consistent throughout the last 12 years .
mexican	i can best describe the place as a taqueria with a bit of asian fusion thrown in the mix . prices are fairly good , considering their target crowd are college folks . as far as flavor is concerned , yayo tacos didn 't disappoint . we tried their taco platter samplers ( 1 & 2 ) which included carnitas , texano , bombay and shanghai variants as well as their carne asada cheese fries and chicken quesadilla with sweet tater sides . location is a easy to miss without a top mounted signage and the restaurant interior is a sure conversational piece by itself . caveat : mexican taco purists might find the added fusion flavors off-putting or just downright weird--we certainly did not .
mexican	we finally found it ! tried it for lunch . great outdoor area. nice atmosphere , very clean . everyone was very friendly , fast service , white cheese dip vs yellow ... we loved that ! complimentary chips , salsa & bean dip . i ordered the vegetarian burrito , it was delish ! it was also huge ! the tortillas were fresh and homemade . hubby ordered the special ... both were $ 8.99ea , so much food , took half of each home . didn 't try the margarita 's this time ( a little early ) but sure will next time .. soon ! !
mexican	this place is the best in the state of az . they use good quality freeh ingredients to prepare the food . everything from the tacos , burritos and quesadillas are superb . they have a salsa bar with many different salsas that are to die for ! ! ! oh and don 't forget to try the horchata . you won 't be dissapointed after eating at this place !
mexican	( pineapple habenero salsa is soooo good . ) i 'm a big fan of the elote , and husband digs their gorditas and empanadas . goes without saying their tacos are outstanding . try this little gem . if you like authentic latin street food you won 't be disappointed .
mexican	in my opinion , it 's the most authentic mexican food in the area . salsa is fresh and the guac is smooth and nutty . being from california , we know good mexican food , and patron ranks up there with some of our socal favorites .
mexican	it 's always fresh and not overly seasoned . big menu to choose from and price comparative with other mexican restuarants in valley . staff have always been nice and efficient . it is now by go to when i need authentic mexican meal !
mexican	husband loves their horchata , and he 's picky !
mexican	we love lindo michoacan . we just ordered some snacks for the nascar race we had recording . chips and salsa ( plus we order the extra hot habanero too ) . the tableside guac is awesome too and to go is just as good . i told them we like it spicy and that 's what we got . i ordered some ceviche with no tostados ( i already had chips ) with extra avocado . it was so fresh and the avocado couldn 't have been greener or riper ! my hubby got a couple tacos and an enchilada and that was probably better eaten there but , still good . the people are always nice and welcoming too . great place !
mexican	the taco salad is massive , pork was shredded and tender , the food tastes great ! brought mine back to our room and am enjoying with a chelada ! don 't even bother with the rita 's , this place is all about the food !
mexican	there used to be several burrito places nearby . tried one which is now gone . that was my first burrito . kinda break the deal ... hard rice , running sauce ... but this one saved the reputation of burrito for me . : )
mexican	maria has great service ! ! food was amazing ! ! ! ! it 's packed with people which means people want to eat there ! ! ! ! keep up the good work ! ! parking is limited .
mexican	servers need a lil more help getting the drinks out faster but the food is great ! can 't wait to go again !
mexican	bean burrito . carne asada . just chips and dip .... everything is awesome !
mexican	awesome food , drinks , service and ambiance , what else can you ask for ? if you love bobby flay and spicy food , you have to check them out . tip - try the coconut cake ; it is a throw down winner .
mexican	although the space is small and always packed , it 's worth the wait if you 've never tried it before
mexican	i have to admit , the first time i went there , i ordered a latte , hoping for them to give me some beautiful latte art , but i didn 't get any . = ( nevertheless , a great relaxing environment to hang out with friends .
mexican	great food and we love the patio . dos is good too and last time we were there they still had their amazing appetizer platter , which the original does not have . atmostphere at dos is not as nice though .
mexican	flavor combinations are amazing . the pork belly taco is the best taco i have ever had .
mexican	very nice fare , very light and authentic . great value for money , too . friendly staff and super quick service . a great place for lunch on a workday .
mexican	never disappointed in anyway . only once ... they ran out of guacamole , but that was 8 : 15pm . i always go with their combo . a beef burrito and a chicken enchilada served with rice , beans and salad . - $ 15.95 . sangria - $ 6.95 . and finish off with the deep fried ice cream - $ 8 . and recently i found out they have an express located in scarborough . will try that later on .
mexican	tried the fish tacos ..... great ! tried the burritos , tostadas , pretty much everything.the one thing i have to rave about is the tortas . holy crap i was amazed .. the roll they put that juicy fantastic meat on is to die for ... add some jalapeno and you are ready to rock and roll ! great selection of mexican beer ! great margarita 's as well !
mexican	been there a lot of times great dishes great stuff always friendly always leave there full if your in the waterfront best mexican spot to do
mexican	i had got the best burritos ever ! nice staff , a chance to win a bicycle , and great music . couldn 't be any happier with salty señorita ! : )
mexican	been there for lunch a bunch of times , food is always good , at lunch time they get busy but never had to wait to long for food .
mexican	never tried there more expensive seafood fare but it looks good . great stand by
mexican	the decor is typical mexican and nothing to write home about . the food is typically mexican if i was in mexico . being in canada anyone should find the fare outstanding and i fully recommend eating at this establishment if you can get in the door . reservations are recommended weekends .
mexican	all food we ordered was great , prices are quite low . parking is limited but you can park on philo st for free . seating is also limited and it was packed when we came , but its still larger than maize .
mexican	our favourite burrito joint by far in the area . service is always friendly .
mexican	thanks ! ! ! the pineapple bowl dish is amazing !
mexican	for around $ 9 you get their big plate or $ 7 for small . the jerk chicken has been consistent every time. check it out if you are near broadview station , south of danforth .
mexican	this location i much better than years past . southwest chicken griller i would recommend .
mexican	best chicken burrito i had in my hood . open late too and i likess it .
mexican	each time the food was great , with decent portions and very tasty . had a pork burrito once and the fish taco the other time . both times excellent choices . service is efficient and courteous - it is a downtown venue hence they get a lot of business-people , so they are used to offering great service . the prices are a bit on the ridiculous side - so beware , although i will be honest , the portions are decent to make you potentially forget that .
mexican	it 's not your typical shredded chicken , it 's more like carne asada . the portion size is perfect , not a huge ball or brick like some places . the chips and salsa are just ok . the salsa is basically pico , not salsa so it needs more flavor . the chips could be a little saltier . the place is very clean with plenty of seating . the prices are a good value as well . gotta try the carne asada tacos next time !
mexican	food is very good and priced right . drinks were a little over priced but tastey . disappointed they did not except my groupon at this location as there were no restrictions as far as i could see . will be going back for sure .
mexican	it 's a nice tapas place which serves not strictly spanish tapas . first time did the 6 tapas for $ 60 chef selection . tonight with a bigger group we did the whole shishang ( all the tapas for $ 210 ) . if you are looking for quantity it 's not the place to be . but the quality is good . i like everything i have tried . the fried potato cubes , paella balls , beef tartar and cheviche are all good . beef ribs are tender . sangria is also delicious . staff is friendly . i didn 't leave hungry either time but if you are still growing may not be able to satisfy .
mexican	great servers and the owner is a sweetheart . i ate the pechuga asada and a pupusa locoye ( sp ? ) this time . the chicken was made right , great beans and rice , fresh avocado , big portions and the salsa and chips are excellent . i live two blocks from here and i need to wake the eff up and go here more .
mexican	always satisfied here , toppings are fresh , i prefer the spicy red sauce . also the original dough not too h any on the carbs . my favorite chain pizza place ! ! service always polite .
mexican	the chairs are not the most comfy so go on the bar stools . lol . good lighting by the bars too if you 're an instagram foodie who likes to take pictures . haha ! anyway , it is ridiculously clean & very friendly workers too . place is spacious but i can imagine it could probably get packed during rush hour too . i love the barabacoa bowl : white rice , pinto beans , medium salsa , corn , cheese , sour cream & lettuce . the chips are yum too , i usually add that on for a buck & some cents . i 'm torn between chipotle & zabas , honestly . i love them both . : )
mexican	the tacos are phenomenal and don 't get me started on the loaded carne frys xd -mindspark staff
mexican	super good food . love their beans , chimichanga and chips . on orders to go call and food is ready in 7 minutes . great prices . not a fancy place so i 'd order to go if you can .
mexican	there 's always people outside and they always seem busy , so that means it must be good . the chips and sauce are the best ! they have a pretty good chorizo breakfast burrito too . it 's cash only and there 's not much for seating , but great to get when you wanna get some mexican food to go .
mexican	southwest meatloaf sliders rocked ! also have tried the empenadas and they were delicious . my co-worker usually gets the cubano sandwich which he says is top notch . yes , the space is a little awkward , but you go in , sit down and eat ... not sure what other reviewers are looking for . service has been freindly and helpful during my visits . keep it up fuego !
mexican	the food is outstanding . everyone raved about their meal . it 's fast-food with sit-down restaurant quality .
mexican	everything we 've tried has been delicious . the lima beans and rice are a family favorite !
mexican	both times was not disappointed ! the tofu and lettuce wraps are a mainstay , along with the lentil and corn beignets . i 'd like to try some of the more adventurous cocktails on a future trip . always go for the kaya chips when ordering a quac or salsa . they are just the right degree of salty . kaya is a good choice for a flavorful dinner in pittsburgh 's strip district . recommended .
mexican	now that l am a yelper i thought i would give it another look . came on a wednesday night and they had a large margarita special , it was good and was not light on the pour , all mexican help and that enhanced the atmosphere ! we were well taken care of ! i had the steak rodeo , while not the best cut of meat it was huge and tasted very good . i 'm a pretty good eater and could not finish it . the service was fast and friendly and i could not find any real fault 's with this establishment . next time it could be first on my list , a nice and happy place ! !
mexican	stumbled upon veracruz and wow ! very good lunch specials , including the cheesesteak burrito . very tasty steak and black beans wrapped in a burrito covered in cheese sauce dip . side of lettuce , tomato , sour cream rice and beans . muy bueno !
mexican	been to maro 's a few times really good place to go if your on a health kick or training for any sport food is fresh well prepared staff work hard and are professional
mexican	clean , friendly , and the food is exactly how i like it . some roberto 's skimp on the good stuff but not this one . the chef at the time made a burrito exactly how a burrito should look like . they deserved all five stars .
mexican	been to rubio 's a few times and the food is always good. could be faster though. also , i hate the tables in there , they always feel sticky which is just sooooo gross to me .
mexican	happened to come by this place by our car service driver from brooklyn . he highly recommended it . we tried it the next night and it is without a doubt the best mexican food we have ever had . the happy hour is incredible , the nachos are amazing . the portions are enormous . the staff very friendly and accommodating and attentive . incredible little place . do not miss out .
mexican	man it was amazing ... food is sooo authentic . i usually dont like mexican food but man i am a huge fan . definitely going back . love the chicken tacos ! ! ! ! yummmmm ! ! ! ! ! ! go here for delicious eats ! fast and great customer service ...
mexican	i love love love their fish tacos ! so many good ingredients and there is plenty enough sauce ! i get these to go because these delicious fish tacos are chock full of great ingredients . try it once ... i 'm hooked !
mexican	nice to see a restaurant taking feedback and ensuring their customers have a great experience . will be hitting this place a lot more times now .
mexican	( can 't speak to their new location on hayden as we haven 't been there yet ) . the drinks are very good , if a bit pricy and the apps are wonderful . ordered the short stack of nachos , stuffed peppers and enchaladas this time . all very good and tasty . one note , everything seemed to be a bit " saucier " this time , especially the nachos . while the sauce is very good and tasty with a good amount of spice , it was a bit mcuh for me . i don 't remember it being that way before so perhaps this was a fluke . will definately be back
mexican	i figured it was time for a small review . nothing bad to say . restrooms could use a little bit of attention but other than that i would say this long standing chilis is still doing a great job . the staff is very polite and from what i could see the dining area is very clean .
mexican	prompt service although the last time i was here , the floor and table were sticky . the green chile tamale had good flavor , was moist and creamy . the shredded beef taco could have had the meat drained better but the flavor was good . love their chips and salsa . when we were there randy johnson , the famous d 'backs pitcher was dining in the restaurant as well .
mexican	it 's pretty authentic . my parents love to go here when i visit . their $ 1 margarita happy hour is the best . can 't beat it ! the staff is friendly and attentive . the surprise location is definitely more " toned down " as someone else noted .... i mean , there are a lot of " early bird special-ers " there lol . give it a go--you won 't be disappointed .
mexican	got just the rolled chicken quesadilla ! and was very good as usual . one of my go to restaurants . starts off with that bomb a * * chips an salsa that they keep filling up ! omg so good ! ! only down fall is i couldnt taste any alcohol in my alcohol ! ! ! ! ! ! ! waiters seem to be real busy cause the bus boys seem to be the one refilling your drinks and chips an salsa ! ! staff always seem so nice but busy ! ! always a good spot ! !
mexican	chevy 's has the best chips and salsa i 've ever tasted and the food is delicious . only complaint is that the restrooms don 't have sensored towel dispensers . not cool man .
mexican	first time trying the sonoran hot dog and it it delicious , wrapped in bacon of course . tacos are always a win my favorite are the fried fish . drinks are delicious favorite is the sangria blanca . atmosphere is great i love that they play a mix of mexican music !
mexican	every single time it is excellent . plenty of staff to make everything go really smooth . the food it awesome and the decor is great ! the plates of food are giant too !
mexican	been to this place 2 times and like it. always friendly staff and fast service. i had the taquitos the first time and really liked them. the combo comes with rice and beans. the second time i ordered the beef steak and liked it too. think and juicy with rice , beans and tortillas. reasonable prices. will be back .
mexican	if two hippies tacos was a woman , i 'd marry her . first timers : get the 3 tacos for $ 5 deal ( i highly recommend the fish tacos ) , sit out on the back patio on one of the painted picnic tables and indulge . second timers , get a carne asada burrito . you 'll thank me later .
mexican	they have the best tamales and their espos salsa is amazing ! the staff is very friendly and i am glad they are still in business !
mexican	love to have a mexican restaurant like this in downtown cave creek . like the margs and chips / salsa . had the chile verde which is good ! me and my husband will come again ! atmosphere is great !
mexican	it 's always quite good . the chicken and beef options are great , but where this place really shines is the vegetarian burritos . the cauliflower burrito is a little strange but worthwhile , but the potato burrito is truly transcendent . it 's something that you wouldn 't think would be very good , but it is . also , that sauce they put in most of the burritos is so good . order spicy .
mexican	good portions . great service . awesome chips and salsa . i suggest everyone try the blended sangria .... best drink on the menu ! !
mexican	the restaurant is new , and the design is modern , clean , and fresh . the employees were courteous and attentive . the food was fresh and satisfying . loved the t bell- themed paintings on the walls too ! very impressive !
mexican	i 've been missing out on some of the best tacos i have ever had in the usa ... they are fast and always fresh . tortillas are hand made while you order ! guacamole is delicious ( actual avocados ) ! ! ! a need to try ! ! ! especially if you love tacos ! ! !
mexican	their rotisserie chicken and excellent sides are quality at a very reasonable price . ive had the 1 / 4 chicken plate with the yuca fries and green beans as well as the chicken and rice bowl which was a ton of food . very modern and appealing interior or a shaded patio surrounded by plants and herbs . can 't wait to try it again !
mexican	the last time i went i sat at the bar . their bartender rebecca was fabulous ! ! ! she was sooooo nice and she was very attentive . she made suggestions for food and drinks . i had the carnitas tacos and a blue moon . she made the experience with her guest service and her constant conversation . even when she was busy , she made time for me and my partner . 5 stars for rebecca . she is an asset to your establishment . i will definitely be back for the awesome food and great service ! ! ! !
mexican	we had the ravioli , pork belly , beets , foie gras mousse , and lamb carpaccio - everything was amazing . the egg bacon ricotta ravioli and carpaccio was our favorite . must go here - great service as well !
mexican	great selection of small plates , tapas , always crowded . food comes fast . great off the strip happening spot . good prices . !
mexican	authentic , high quality & great price for what you get . salsa de chile de arbol was the best ! ! loved the decor . orchata tasted fresh , which is a rarity in most mexican restaurants .
mexican	all are great and we will continue to go there . nice staff as well . bonus : there is a soft serve ice cream joint across the street so you can have a cone after your tacos .
mexican	the white sangria and seafood pallela are delicious ! ! ! love the secure and atmosphere very cozy . great date place .
mexican	day 1 : carne asada breakfast burrito , good flavor and lots of carne , no potatoes and very little egg . turned out to be a carne and cheese burrito but was still good . day 2 : bacon breakfast burrito ; lots of potato almost no egg and cheese with a right amount of bacon . it was a good bacon and potato burrito . the tortillas are really good and the salsa is awesome !
mexican	pro 's - chips and salsa really good . significantly better than the usual fare - pulled pork was super ! - atmosphere great con 's - servers okay . i wouldn 't say overly helpful . so this was / is a letdown i will continue coming here . good value !
mexican	always friendly & attentive staff . food is delicious ! i recommend the carnitas plate with corn tortillas . the place can get busy & at times feels crowded but the freshness of the food & the great service make up for it .
mexican	we tried the loaded nachos , chicken burritos , and quesadilla . all tasty and just the right amount of burn . they have a coke freestyle machine for variety . we will return often !
mexican	island style food with a mexican style twist to it . the burritos were great and so were the tacos and made fresh on the spot . great service which is a huge plus in my eyes . glad i didn 't wait any longer ! ! !
mexican	and friendly staff ! i 'll definitely be coming back !
mexican	as far as i know , thos is the only good taco shop in vegas outside of north vegas . their salsas were both very good , as well as the agua fresca . i got a carne asada , adobada , and buche taco and all three were good . i also got a vampiro which was also really good . their salsa bar had some good pickled carrots with some free cucumbers and lines . once the weather isn 't so hot , i look foreward to trying their birria de chivo , which is really hard to find on this side of vegas .
mexican	they sure delivered . the tamales are awesome ! ordered the dozen , and not only did the owner throw in some bean tamales to sample , but she added more meat tamales of my choice because she 's been getting slack on yelp . totally unnecessary , but much appreciated . i loved the beef tamales , while the wife preferred the chicken . the salsa is tasty with a pretty good kick . and the beans , don 't forget the beans , pure awesome ! we 'll definitely be coming back . the owner is an absolute sweetheart , and the customer service is top notch .
mexican	we have been to numerous tapas restaurants and our expectations were high . this did not disappoint ! sangria 's were fantastic ! food was melt in your mouth good ! service was over the top ! and atmosphere was quiet , and warm . our waiter really took care of us and brought us things we would have never tried on our own . overall an a + experience ! so lucky to have such a quality high end tapas place near by .
mexican	the place is literally a shack but omg don 't let that deter you from checking it out . i ordered the california burrito which had carne asada , guac , potatoes , and sour cream . with a side of chips and guac . people are super nice and the guac is super tasty . i would like a tub of just that with their paper thin chips . so addicting . carne asada in the burro was delish . some of the best i 've ever had and the burrito was full of it . go check it out ! ! sad they close at 2pm otherwise i would grab it for dinner on my way home from work .
mexican	finally , i mustered up the courage and went inside .. and thank god i did . my cousin and i ordered two tacos each which is good if you want a meal . we both had the baja fish , the spicy pork and the grilled octopus . i definitely recommend the baja fish . the spicy pork and grilled octopus is also delicious too ! one bad thing is that there are literally no seats , either stand by the counter to eat or sit on the bench outside if it 's not already taken !
mexican	everything was very tasty but the salsa on the fish taco was really spicy but good . i also ordered the bottomless chips and salsa , i loved that the chips were hot , nice and crispy . you can also choose 2 different salsas i had medium and mild and they weren 't spicy at all . the blueberry margarita was delicious i wish i would 've seen the check in for a free house margarita but it 's ok maybe next time .
mexican	the place is small with half of its space taken up by the kitchen and prep areas , aside from one medium table and standing bar seating for another 8 people there isn 't much room to move around . the food is where this place really kicks off fantastically fresh amazing dishes that are ready quickly . considering that this is a place that has 15-20 people in line at any given point that 's an exceptional feat . had the marlin and beef both were seasoned perfectly and we 're great . couldn 't be happier , but some extra seating would be nice .
mexican	stopped in yesterday and omg it was well worth it the food was amazing and the service and people there were too so friendly and happy to help . if you 're ever in town to get a chance to stop bye do it .
mexican	had the carne asada street taco plate with jamacia . it was delish -- took me back to rocky pointe vacations . the beans are authentic and the rice is white salvadorian style . great art work and service . can 't wait to go back .
mexican	i enjoyed my meal , service was good . my friend thought their meal was only ok . will be back to try a mojito .
mexican	for the price , these tacos are pretty darn good . i love corn tortillas and having two per taco helps make sure the taco doesn 't fall apart . the toppings are truly the best part . the different salsas , cilantro , and lime added so much flavor ! if you need to satisfy a taco craving , i would recommend .
mexican	i pass by it every time i come to vegas to see some family . finally had an opportunity to go and this place is legit ! ! ! there was about 6 of us that went and everyone had something different which turned out to benefit me since i got to go all " vulture mode " on everything . i will make this a staple on my subsequent return visits . sunday 's are weird hours but if you want an epic meal you 'll figure something out .
mexican	so happy i finally got the chance to experience all the great things people have been saying . great food , great margaritas , and a really cool atmosphere . i 'll be back !
mexican	very good flatbread tacos ! i recommend for sure !
mexican	they have street tacos of all kinds of meat , burritos , nachos , tostadas etc . we had tacos el pastor , asada fries , carnitas taco , and tostadas de buche . loved the tacos el pastor ! they had great flavor . also liked that we could order beers or whatever . if u like authentic street tacos then this is the place to go !
mexican	the service was excellent , the food was excellent , and the menu is fairly priced . i ordered a thresher shark taco , lobster taco and a shrimp taco with mussels to start sooo good !
mexican	we were seated right away and our waitress was friendly and gave us enough time to look at the menu . i ordered the seasonal pick which was the steak tacos with mexican street corn and they were really good . i would definitely eat these again . everything about the place was nice and i enjoyed my meal but it just wasn 't the " wow " factor i was hoping for from everyones opinion . we also ordered the queso ( hot ) and the mango guac ( out of this world ) . id go back and try other stuff for sure
mexican	basically it 's a club inside of a taco bell . loud music everywhere and people many people . good spot to socialize and grab a bite . the menu options are dirt cheap and i have no clue how yum makes money with such cheap food . dollar menu cheap burritos you name it they have it for fantastic drink food . hey also have alcoholic slushes which are a plus .
mexican	it 's setup like a moe 's or chipotle 's but thank god no one screams at you when you walk through the door . the owner and staff immediately realized i wasn 't a local and we 're very friendly so i 've been back a couple times and the result is the same , great food n service !
mexican	this is one of my favorite parts of the day , this taco is absolutely delicious in every way and not to much or two little of food . the fish is freshly cooked , hot and crispy and actually juicy as well . smothered in an excellent hot sauce ( which they have a plethora of a selection compared to anywhere else in town ) makes my day every time . thank you taco shack for openning a nice lil mom n pop food spot in downtown tempe !
mexican	these are amazing but sometimes overly fried , though the fish itself is always tender and moist . add some salsa for more flavor. it is a bit on the expensive side for simple fried fish tacos . i would also consider trying the burritos that can be fish burritos , shrimp burritos , or lobster burritos which are all amazing . regardless of what you get , 2 tacos , or burrito that comes w / chips , i guarantee you will be full !
mexican	2 fatty tacos & i 'm done .. chronic tacos is pretty amazing .
mexican	beer is cold , tequila is good and guacamole is spicy ... and that 's how latin bar should be
mexican	atmosphere excellent . tacos great . very cool decor . and prices are reasonable . check it out !
mexican	beer needs to be colder every time we go it is cold but not much colder than room temp the dosxx tacos are a must jake potter was the best waiter ever there we would wait for his section
mexican	how can this be bad . i walked in and found a nice authentic atmosphere and tacos are delicious ! 5tacos and a beer for under 10 bucks . that 's what i 'm talking about .
mexican	my favorites are the fresh guacamole , the enchiladas and the carne asada . the restaurant is family friendly . it 's our weekly friday night spot ! ! ! ps ... carmen is our favorite server ! ! ! !
mexican	as with all mad mex 's , the draft beer list is always great with a broad range of styles . youre sure to find a beer youre in the mood for .. and happy hour is hard to beat with half off drafts and wings from 4 : 30-6 : 30pm on weekdays . the burritos seem to be a hit , but i think theyre overrated . the nacho grande is huge and loaded , and tastes alright . wings are pretty decent , especially with their blue cheese . all in all , id say come here for happy hour to feel the full affect of mad mex
mexican	bud lights ? lose 1 star . awesome salsa and toppings bar . add 1 star . excellent tacos pastor . add 1 star . barbacoa . asi-asi . i 'll be back for more tacos pastor , but i 'd sure like a 12 oz . negro modelo with it .
mexican	one of the best dive bars in vegas see for yourself . carnitas tacos a 10 !
mexican	the service was friendly and quick ! we will visit again !
mexican	when i was first dragged in here to try a potato burrito . i thought my friend was crazy . i soon discovered that potatos in a burrito were the best idea ever . it 's a must try after an afternoon shopping along the queen west strip .
mexican	i like this place because in the land of pricey dining , it is pretty inexpensive . they have great salsa , and really good food . not the best enchilada taco combination ever , but right up there ... and they aren 't shy with serving sizes . i would be happy to eat there again .
mexican	ok , this restaurant is right by the canal , so it 's a lovely place to have breakfast , lunch , dinner , tea while listening to the amazing gondola performers . we had a simple breakfast , omelette , churros , empanada , and i forgot the rest . the churros had caramel in the middle and it came with goat milk caramel sauce . it was so awesome ! their coffee is good too !
mexican	i had totally forgot that they had that there . man , it was such a good choice to hea don there . i had a burrito with barbacoa , black beans with rice , mild salsa , and guacamole . i love their guacamole - i don 't know what it is , but it 's just mouth-watering . not only this , service is ridiculously fast .
mexican	make sure you reserve as it doesnt have many places and it 's always packed . all the tacos come in 2 per plate so it 's easy to share with another friend . theyre all delicious and very flavorful . the churros are also delicious . the service is fast and the staff is friendly and make good recommandations . it 's prob my fave tacos place .
mexican	we didn 't want to go to the strip so we found this place thru yelp .. everything from the decor to the people that work there is great .. the service is exceptional ... your drink is not even half way when someone is already replacing it .. food is great , very good portions . they place chips , beans and salsa while ur seating down deciding what to order . we ask for the guacamole n ohh it 's fresh n so delicious you can 't stop eating it . you got to try this place .. whenever i 'm in vegas , i will definitely go again .
mexican	it was the sauteed rock shrimp . now ... does not remembering what i ate mean the food was forgettable , or does it simply mean that i killed one too many brain cells this weekend . i 'll let you make that decision ( one is far more likely than the other ) . something that i always fret about are serving sizes . serve me a massive plate of food with only a little of what i ordered and like 90 % rice won 't make me happy , but serve me a dish with a generous helping of shrimp on a bed of rice and greens and i 'm a happy camper . i 'll camp here more often .
mexican	then i had this and now i 'm a fan of better mexican food . their menu is pretty awesome , really big pictures to show what you going eat . carne asada fries ! carne asada chimchangas ! oh my ! that 's the best , top it off with spices they have ! i love this place !
mexican	chipotle still has my heart , just a smaller piece of it ... as i am now a die-hard loyalist to the q ! ! ! loves this location because the staff is friendly and the guys are always heavy-handed with the chicken for my quesadillas and queso burrito ! loves that you can dine out back on the patio porch in the summer and enjoy the breathtaking view of the apartment complex fountain ... lol ! food is delish , staff is cool , and a ( back deck ) room with a view ... what more could you ask for ? ? ?
mexican	man is this place good ! ! authentic food ( which is rare , lemme tell ya ! ) and margaritas delivered to my table by the pitcher ? ? yes please ! ! ! parking can be crap , so be warned for that , but otherwise skip taco hell , skip that chipoltle crap and run , don 't walk , to luchitas ! ! !
mexican	with that said , i loved the food . i ordered their famous sonoran dog and also a carmelos . the dog was great . it was very messy but worth all the used napkins . the carmelos , which i was unsure of what it was , also was tasty . it reminded me of a quesadilla , there is the white in me , and was just as satisfying . be prepared , it is huge and easily can be shared . as others mentioned , the salsa bar was good size and there is plenty of room to sit . only slight negative was they were a little slow but not enough to warrant four stars . will be back .
mexican	it covers the nutrients i need to start the day with a bunch of good quality ingredients ! i usually get chicken or beef burrito bowl . their service is amazing too : )
mexican	the food was great ! the waitress .... wish i could remember her nam : ( ... was excellent ! she helped with out 10 year old and my no dairy issue . the chicken tacos were some of the best i 've ever had ! the salsas were both super yummy ! lots of flavor but not real spicy . the rest of the family love the black beans ( i didn 't eat them ) the ship tacos were really good too . i would go back here again !
mexican	this one is always running out of stuff . the beans always look like they have been there all day . that being said , it 's chipotle ! it 's awesome anyway . i love chipotle , chipotle is my life !
mexican	since the remodel i feel all employees have a new outlook . there are new faces and new attitudes . there are a couple familiar faces and one of which is enrique , he has been there for a while , he is always fast , accurate , and enthusiastic about this job . i 'm hoping by now he is at least assistant manager or manager . something to keep in mind when visiting is that this location is surrounded by not only sun city folk , but snowbirds . it 's going to be busy , many of our older folk move slow . that 's not always the employees issue .
mexican	however , i grew up in san diego and those are big shoes to fill for sure and i do believe that they could hold their own in and so cal location . the steak for their steak fries are second to none and that in itself makes rivas mexican grill in our neighborhood ! ! !
mexican	hands down my favorite tacos ever . the one downside to this place is there aren 't many veggie options , so i go here with my carnivore friends only .
mexican	the food was great and staff was super friendly and fast . looking at the portions i thought i would be starving an hour later , but i was stuffed . it filled me to the point where i couldn 't drink beer and had to turn to the harder adult beverages . i gave pink taco 4-stars because their pitchers of margaritas on the rocks , while tasty , were kind of pricey . eh , its vegas though , and you 've got to pay the cost to be the boss .
mexican	moved on to $ 2 beers , try the victoria , and $ 3 margaritas , during happy hour that is . then finished with their mole , which is hands down the best i 've had in the states . attentive , knowledgable service from genuinely friendly servers , awesome job hyatt & roberto ! ! my new favorite haunt ... definately worth coming all the way from baltimore for ! !
mexican	that 's when i get a chance to grab me some pollo loco ! ! such a different chicken place from the others ! ! their fire grilled marinated process just makes the difference ! ! so many sides to choose from , it 's getting me hungry just writing this review ....... i have visited this location a few times during my visits and have always had good service . they have horchata here too ! ! ! would be nice if they expanded the market to washington state ! ! ( hint , hint ....... ) i would definitely visit here again .
mexican	the food is to die for , you will not be disappointed . their plantains , rice and beans and sandwiches are all fantastic . try the congri with some boiled yuca . i purchased some croquetas to bring home to my family all 12 of them didn 't stand a chance . looking for fresh cuban bread ? done . looking for tres leches amazing mind blowing dessert ? done . they even have a nice bar with tvs so you can watch the game ( futball ) this is my new go to place , because there 's no comfort food like cuban food : )
mexican	starting with the salsas that are made daily from scratch , the amaaaaazing and unique horchata i 'd gladly buy gallons of , and surprisingly fresh and so tasty salads .. i just cant get enough of doña celina 's cooking . she is the sweetest and warm owner that welcomes everyone like family . plus they have raspados ( snow cones ) and elote en vasito ( corn in a cup ) to die for ! ! ! . i am officially the biggest fan and id gladly direct everyone looking for authentic mexican food ! !
mexican	but , with that said , i think i 'm going to have to agree that burrito boyz are gonna be on my fav 5 places to eat in toronto . whether you pick up take out and eat at lake ontario with the fam bam , or come hungry for a midnight snack , a veggie burrito with everything made hot surely hits the spot ! ! ! fresh ingredients , spicy hot sauce , and the tortilla made golden brown to the perfect crisp with green jalepenos and melted cheese . yum-eh ! ( haha get it ? )
mexican	the value is there the flavor is there . i promote them to all my friends .. as a chef i am very picky ! ! i have crossed off more restaurants lately because of sucky food so go to yayo tacos for some killer grub if you like hot ask for there hot creation its smokin so beware .. and beer and tequila list is huge
mexican	this one just seems to be missing it 's enthusiasm . i felt rushed when i came in for lunch . i can 't complain about the food portions seem up to standards if not more .
mexican	i was ( once again ) impressed ! not only by the prices , but the quality of food . i got two burgers and fries all for less than $ 10 . both of the employees were lovely as well . the decor inside is a little old fashioned , but it gives the place that character / charm . it makes you feel comfortable .
mexican	personally , i would 've loved even more of the green chile , but for phoenix , it was yummy ! packed on a friday morning - does anyone work anymore ?
mexican	caesar palace has tons of options but we decided to dine here for the night . i started with tiger shrimp roasted garlic corn tamale with cilantro sauce . this thing was amazing . one of the best tamales i have ever eaten in my life . all the flavors sync up and its the best . its more on a pricey side from your $ 2 tamales but its life changing . i also ordered the steak but i thought it was okay . the roasted corn was pretty good and the double baked potatoes . all in all , i got to cross it off my list of restaurant i been wanting to try . service was really good too .
mexican	so immediate seating . ordering a manzanita mule ( don julio + ginger beer + lime juice & garnished with candied ginger ) - no problem . having a fun chat with personable ( & creative ) chef crystal parker - unhurried . hey - that 's five star for ambiance and service . tostada de mariscos was my delicious appetizer which i heated up with some hot sauce . octopus was a nice touch . sizzling molcajete with shrimp , chicken , and steak ( garnished with a big roasted pepper ) was beautiful to look at , tasty and generous . enough for two . not on anyone else 's menu . you probably need reservations for weekends . i wouldn 't know . enjoy .
mexican	overall the food isn 't half bad . when i 'm looking for a quick mexican joint i would come back here . service was quick and the food was hot . unsure why the different combos ie the two and three item combos have such a limited selection but overall the one item combo was more than enough to fill you up .
mexican	i finally had the chance to try it . absolutely amazing ! it is endless small plates brunch , so you can try a variety of items . the chilaquiles are amazing and the shrimp and grits ! ! you have to of course get the endless mimosas , it 's not brunch without them . i sat on the patio since the weather was perfect . service was very quick given how busy it gets for brunch . two thumbs up ! will certainly be coming here again !
mexican	and all the servers were really nice ! food came crazy slow , but she kept us stocked on chips and drinks . the buffalo fajitas were the best thing i had .
mexican	we had the ceviche appetizer and had the chicken molé as my main dish . it reminded me of good ol fashion home cooking . i would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys really good mexican food .
mexican	i was very impressed by their salsas and the quality of their customer service . i will definitely recommend their food and i must say they have the best tacos in all las vegas !
mexican	let me tell you ..... the best mexican i he had in a long long time . authentic , flavorful and just the right spice . not overloaded with cheese and grease . i can 't wait to go back . so excited we found this place .
mexican	i had the brisket soft taco , spicy pork taco and the shredded chicken nachos and they were to my surprise very very good . i would strongly recommend trying their menu . the atmosphere was quaint and appealing . i will come back on my next trip to tempe .
mexican	this place has no gimmicks , it does not want to impress you with pictures of beaches or palm trees or coronas to make you think you 're in a beach in mexico , it 's bottom-line no bull great mexican food . i 've been to this place about five times , by myself , work colleagues , and even clients and everyone always leaves happy from this place ... my recommendation : the steak tacos are out of this world and a " raspado " for dessert is heaven . summary : fast , good service , and food is amazing !
mexican	my mantra is " the dirtier the location , the better the food . " from the moment i tried the salsa from the chips , i knew that this place was solid . shredded chicken burrito california style . get that and you won 't go wrong .
mexican	that 's pretty hard to beat . i recommend going with the burrito bowl , telling the server " don 't be shy " with the toppings ( pro tip : even if you order double meat and get guacamole , three price only comes to about $ 11 ) and getting the habanero salsa . it 's not as spicy as out doings , and gives the mask a pleasant kick . also sit outside , because it has an outdoor seating area . good for people watching all the yuppies , lol .
mexican	at least for the next few hours ! the quality of the beef is fantastic ! i mean to die for ! the enchiladas are fantastico ! i think blaco even compares to the classic choices in town like jordan 's and ajo als . if you 're looking to satisfy your rampant mexican food addiction , look no further .
mexican	the green chile was good the red was awesome , had the enchiladas which were awesome and also the posole was great . wait staff was nice , the place had a great vibe , i will definitely be going back many more times .
mexican	not only authentic chile , but a familiar face and taste i 've enjoyed from las cruces and farmington , nm . real hatch green chile . real , actual sopapillas and a photo of the original restaurant from the home of my college , nmsu in las cruces ... i 'll be back for sure . thank you for existing , now never close !
mexican	i find someburros to be quite satisfying . it is not a _ bertos clone , so don 't go expecting carne asada like you 're used to . it has a more authentic menu , that isn 't all that authentic , but more so than _ bertos . the pollo fundido is indeed delectable and decadent . the three way burro is scrumptious and may i suggest a cheese crisp with green chiles , which is my personal fav . it 's a bit more pricey than _ bertos , but well worth it . call in your order and they have a pick up window . you can 't beat convenience .
mexican	caramba 's is the best fast food joint around . made fresh daily . one of the few places that know how to make a crispy cheese crisp . few places make good menudo , but this one one of them . i like both white and red , but prefer the red . lots of carne , very flavorful , not greasy . great beef tacos . multiple salsa flavors on a salsa bar . red and green chili are good too . you won 't be disappointed with the food or prices . caramba 's ........ where you don 't peso much !
mexican	i 'll be honest , i 've only been there once but will now be a regular ! every single thing from the chips to the deep fried ice cream was great ! the service was amazing ! it was early in the evening so they weren 't too busy but no one stood around ! ! i loved it and will be back this week !
mexican	eating it makes me think of home , and summers at the beach . the quality cannot be touched by any " fast food " place , both on service and food . my only slight complaint is that everything is cooked to order , fresh and delicious , so there 's a wait in the drive thru and inside . a small price to pay , for perfection .
mexican	everything is fresh and made from scratch . if you are looking for chipotle or salsaritas - then go there , this is what a real mexican burrito tastes like ! now - if only charlotte had a beach ...
mexican	don patron definitely rose to my expectations ! their chips were fresh and light . their salsa had just the right amount of spice ! texas margarita was a perfect blend . portions very generous and food quality great ! ! highly recommend !
mexican	husband and i split 3 - chose the chicken , pork and beef . chicken and pork were my favorites ! ! meat to corn ratio was perfect- staff was friendly , my margarita was great and hubby loved their horchata ! ! great salsa also
mexican	jose andres didn 't disappoint . there were so many outstanding dishes to tantalize our taste buds . memorable were the ferran adria olives , worth another visit just for this plate . pollo ajillo had an intense flavor that burst in your mouth but looked nothing like the traditional version . the service was exemplary , food arrived on the table when requested , the only reason that we had to give four stars is that it is a very noisy location .
mexican	being a truck driver i have tried a lot of different across the country this is one of the best finds i have found being a close walk from the truck stop had the beef fajitas this trip through the beef and peppers were seasoned perfectly very generous on that part could use a little more of the beans and rice that is really the only thing it lacked on with the fresh chips and tortillas service was quick and friendly will definitely be back when i come to las vegas
mexican	sonoran is my fav and this little place does it up right . great service and excellent red chili
mexican	i will say la ristra has some killer margaritas such as the cadillac margarita and passion fruit margarita . as for the food enchiladas were great although the they claim to be new mexican i can say they are more of a new mexican influence as a lot of their food has a gringo touch , as you can see with their salsa 's and chile . overall i really enjoyed la ristra and would go back . definitely a great find in gilbert .
mexican	i bring my kids for carne asada here once a week ..... its incredible ! ! the produce here is super cheap as well . i 've been here a dozen times and i always want to over eat ..... the all meat burritos are the best and cheap ! ! totally fun to walk around the market and look at things that fry 's or albertson 's doesn 't have . who doesn 't want to see a cow head in the meat section ? ? see you soon ! ! !
mexican	the food is so authentic that makes me feel i am back in my hometown . i gave it 4 stars only because their service is far from the best . people who work there are not the nicest you will ever see , orders are often delayed and they even mixed up my order twice .
mexican	good prices , great food , excellent service . juevos rancheros for the win ! ! ! if you 're going for baja fresh , this ain 't it . this is more tex-mex style cooking , not baja style .
mexican	it is the real deal .. it 's brazilian comfort food ! ! do not expect to find the food you would eat at texas do brazil , because there you will find food adapted to the american culture . the food was delicious and maybe it was luck , but the girl who served me was really polite and my order was taken straight away and the food came fast ! i found interesting to see reviews saying that they went to try brazilian food and ordered the lamb gyros .. ( btw it is greek ) . i will go back for sure !
mexican	if you ask me to go back .... oh yes . mexican cuisine - let 's start with our waiter , javier awesome job and his interaction with us ( 4 ) was great . the top shelve guacamole was made at the table and was good and the food was very good .. there had been some changes to old items on the menu ( good changes that enhanced the product ) . new menu items which i choose to try which i enjoyed .. i 'll leave it up to you to choose your new favorite food .
mexican	have lived in az ( tucson ) for nearly 4 years . did not know that this fantastic restaurant was located in az . it is a great place to go listen to some bachata , merengue and salsa . while enjoying some delicious dishes . definitely one of my top places to eat in az . gracias por la deliciosa comida
mexican	tenoch is a restaurant that will be full with mexicans enjoying what we could only have over there . tacos al pastor , quesadillas , pambazos y tamales are very good . our surprise was to find as a saturday special beef tongue tacos ! the right " sazon " accompanied with an excellent nopalitos salad ( cactus ) . bring your favourite mexican friend and you won 't be disappointed !
mexican	after a hike by the rocky river , we found this pupuseria . it satisfied our hunger and made us feel at home . the pupusia were bigger and higher quality than what i was used to and the slaw was great . the only thing i found wanting was the hot sauce--not spicy at all , but even a little bland . but other than that , this place is the real deal . happy to call this one of our new favorite places !
mexican	being from a carribean background i know that most places lack customer service and if the place has good customer service normally the food isn 't so good.this place has the best balance that ive witnessed in the city.their lunch specials are very inexpensive and it has probably the best jerk chicken in the city
mexican	that being said , the food was great ! ! i had a carne asada burrito combo . the burrito was done enchilada style and the sauce was flavorful without being spicy . the rice was cooked to perfection and tasted just like it came from my nana 's kitchen . everything was delicious and very reasonably priced . 10 / 10 i would definitely order again !
mexican	i was pleasantly surprised , it wasn 't the best fish , but good for arizona standards . went there on a tuesday and got the " taco tuesday " special .
mexican	mundo is the first place i 've been in vegas ( only been here for 3 years and certainly open to suggestions ) that really stacks up to the authentic sonoran mexican food served just one state to our south . strong work mundo , keep it up . also , the margaritas are pretty darn tasty
mexican	i had the elotes loco traditional style and carne asada sopes ... most restaurants don 't know what that is ... but the meat was tender and i put the green chile salsa on it i 'm impressed ! the service was fast and friendly and i plan on coming back !
mexican	this place definitely did not disappoint me . the tacos and the carne asada fries were amazing . definitely give this place a try . we will definitely be back .
mexican	between the four of us we had a mixture of different items . everyone agreed the carne asada was pretty plain even with all the toppings . the al pastor was down right though ! perfect flavor and moist . a cilantro sauce on top was really good . all in all the place is good but a little expensive for just tacos .
mexican	the menu was your basic taco , burrito , and torta place with a little bar in the back . the service was top notch maybe because it was slow on a sunday afternoon never the less 10 stars for that . the staff went as far as making us stuff not on the menu it was 12pm and we wanted breakfast . they inquired on what we might like to eat and 10 min later in front of me sat a dish not on the menu . you can 't beat service like this . thanks again will definitely visit next time i 'm in vegas .
mexican	i am quite familiar with really good mexican and new mexican food , carlitos was a welcoming surprise , tastes like i am home and the portions are enough for 2-3 people . red or green chile , carnitas ..... you name frito pie , wow .. awesome ...
mexican	faustos is one of my favorite places here in vegas ! try their $ 1 chicken tacos on tuesdays ..... you won 't regret it !
mexican	the tacos are al carbon style , so they use real charcoal . ask for flour tortillas with yours . the place is very small with only a few things on the menu . but their carne asada tacos are absolutely the best thing on the menu . 4 will fill you up and they 're only $ 1.50 each ! also , great friendly service and nice selection of salsas at the salsa bar . my favorite is the roasted salsa . i 've hunted all over phoenix trying to find a great sonoran carne asada taco . i guess i found my place .
mexican	great for lunch . prices are extremely reasonable and less expensive than many places in the strip . i believe they had a 2-12oz beer deal for $ 7 . we didn 't find that anywhere else on the strip .
mexican	being from la i 've tried all sorts of tacos from upscale to taco trucks i have to say hands down my favorite tacos i just wish i live here tacos are the best .....
mexican	after reading an article on eater about coconuts coming to la , i was super excited to try as i was going to visit my parents in scottsdale . i 'm so glad i did ... best fish taco i have ever had ! yes , that 's a bold statement , but very true . the fish was perfect . the slaw was amazing . so fresh ! i can 't wait to go again and again !
mexican	being from los angeles and having access to pupussa everywhere i have to say i love the food here great price , service and pupusa 's
mexican	la santisima was a yelp driven decision right before driving back to ca . the food was absolutely amazing .......... an explosion of flavor that is second to none . you can taste the attention given to the preparation and the quality of all the ingredients . i 'm going to always make time whenever i 'm in phoenix to stop in ......... however the food is so special that i may actually drive back every so often for a fix .
mexican	if you really want to try authentic mexican food without going to mexico , eat at pinches tacos . trust me , it 's like a demo version of mexico served in america .
mexican	this is the place where i found my childhood flavors ! fantastic food and nice staff !
mexican	" what 's the most authentic mexican place in charlotte . " i always send them to three amigos . while it is impossible to replicate the real flavors of mexico or really any other country . this place come pretty darn close . the tacos al pasto and the mole are some of the best around .
mexican	simple , awesome food , friendly staff and great prices ... in fact lunch was so good that we wound up back for a late dinner 10 hours later ! ! ! do yourself a favor & check this place out .
mexican	we certainly found it here . we almost didn 't go in because we thought it would be a little more upscale , but glad we didn 't pass this by . best chimi i ever had and the prices are less than half of what i would expect to pay . service was super fast and with a smile . wish there was something like this back home .
mexican	this . place . is . amazing ! ! ! i could eat 100 of these tacos they 're so good .
mexican	this is our 2nd time in , and i had to express my overwhelming interest in this restaurant . the food is amazing , especially the carne adovada , and the best sopapillas in nevada . love the service , and the owners make you feel right at home . we will be back , and back again . john and rebeca
mexican	usually , what is served is crap poblano chile that tastes nothing like real hatch valley chile . naturally , we rolled our eyes and scoffed at the sight of " new mexico green " on their menu , but the server talked us into giving it a shot . we were pleasantly surprised , because what we were served is actually new mexico hatch valley green chile . i had the green chile mac and cheese and highly recommend it . service was great , beer was excellent , food was outstanding . highly recommend .
mexican	i used to go to the original si señor in las cruces for lunch and happy hour , and i 'm happy to see the same great food happy hour here in chandler . best chips and salsa and sopapillas in town !
mexican	recently moved to phoenix and this one was closest to my house , and thank the burrito gods for that , as i 've been here at least once a week since moving . this is by far the best chipotle i 've ever eaten at . not only is the staff incredibly friendly and more portion-generous than i 'm used to in nyc , but the ingredients are always fresh and fantastic , the restaurant is very clean , and they 're very fast ; even with the line to the door , i still get my meal within a few minutes of walking in .
mexican	hands down the best part is the salsas and chips they bring out before the meal . one red , one green chile enchilada sauce ( warm ) , one sour cream chile / jalapeno and one bean dip ( warm ) . overall the other food is good with the typical nm fair , nothing outstanding but all good . i like the gorditas plate . interior is santa fe style , kinda outdoor feel .
mexican	this little hole in the wall holds its own ! the only bad thing is , the line out the door ! people waiting for their orders should not block the doorway ! ! !
mexican	most of the places i 've gone to have the eggs in a container ready to pour onto the flat top . not here . i saw eggs in a crate , obviously cracked to order . the guy that took my order , the owner i think was really nice . the place is no frills which reminds me of the places in california . the food was great , the breakfast burrito hit the spot and i was stuffed . the red salsa is bomb . definitely going to be back when i need a fix .
mexican	but this place is an amazing perfect blend of what i call baja mexican and arizona mexican even something as simple as their rolled tacos here is absolutely amazing cooked just the way i remember growing up . i seriously think i ate like a full cup of salsa every time i come here the best i get the hottest one and grilled peppers on the side amazing
mexican	i really love tijuana flats ! the food is yummy and the people are nice !
mexican	this was highly rated so we gave it a try . i had the enchiladas and my wife had the fajitas . both were excellent and the service was great . the enchiladas were served unique from the traditional chili smothering . they instead came like fajitas with onions , red and green peppers . nice change of pace . we were not disappointed . very good .
mexican	i certainly recommend this peruvian restaurant . viva el peru carajo
mexican	the enchiladas itzel were so good and cheesy that i actually came here twice on my vacation in phoenix . the restaurant is extremely clean and the decor is like that of cheesecake factory , however unlike cheesecake the prices are what you would expect from an mexican restaurant . the service was exceptional and really made my anniversary . would definitely recommend this place .
mexican	but i must admit that i was pleasantly surprised by this place . the fruit , frozen margaritas were so fresh and yummy , although slightly pricey ; just get the 32 oz one , better bang for your buck . definitely get the bottomless chips and salsas and ask for their hotter salsa to go with it . it was all really good . my table ordered quesadillas and tortillas soup , no complaints on the food . also a nice atmosphere sitting on the outdoor patio . would definitely recommend this place .
mexican	for some reason i don 't eat much in vegas . i just drink or drink and gamble and i guess i just forget . but for some reason when i leave the club wasted late at night , i some how remember and have to go to felipito 's . no matter at what cost . most of the time i take a cab there . one time i made the limo driver go there and pick up some burritos and fries for my friends and i. another time i was to drunk and no cabs would pick me up . so i deiced to walk all the way from mgm . some how i didn 't get jumped or arrested and enjoyed my cali burrito .
mexican	it is fantastic ! i 'm vegetarian and usually get simple items like bean & cheese burrito or chile relleno and they are excellent ... but my fiance raves about their meat dishes . the service is excellent and the restaurant is very clean . the prices are very reasonable . overall , there is nothing to not love about it ! !
mexican	i 've been hitting up another taco shop near this location at lunch and was just ok with their food . after coming to don tortaco , i doubt i will ever go back to the other spot . their california burrito is a proper cali burrito ( although i recommend adding guacamole and removing pico ) , their tortillas are bomb and their spicy carrots are actually spicy and tender . hot sauce is good . overall , this place is exactly what i 'm looking for in a local taco shop who can make carne and other items just like home .
mexican	this place was excellent . atmosphere , service , food . thanks yelp ! for recommending this place . we 'll return next time we are in vegas .
mexican	this place exceeded my expectations on taste and presentation . i got the al pastor bowl ( sans guac ) and it was quite tasty ! price was great @ 5.99 and portion was perfect . for a first timer i definitely recommend them for lunch on the patio . i may try this spot for dinner as the lighting outside , i 'm sure , would be beautiful at night .
mexican	i have finally found it . elmer 's is some of the best i have ever had . keep up the great work ! !
mexican	then i found this place the arepas are amazing i usually get mine with shredded chicken or beef with white cheese ( recommended ) , i also tried the empanadas they are really good too and for dessert i had a churro wasn 't the best but it was good . i recommend this place , and enjoy some venezuela and colombia cousin
mexican	dropped in earlier , grabbed a couple tacos and a beer . service was awesome , the young lady that served me taylor i think was her name was . she was on point . great attitude and epic service. food just as good as home and they even have a full service bar that you can play video poker and do shots if you want . only in vegas . i 'll definitely be returning . cheers !
mexican	taqueria guadalajara has great food , but lack of atmosphere . a lot of people were getting food to go while we were there .
mexican	la palapa is great ! i always start with their chips and salsa - and finish with their three enchilada dish . i love that it 's byob ... and in my taste , white wine tastes best with mexican food ! i can 't wait to go back ... and maybe one of these days i 'll try something new . their vegetarian soup and fish tacos sound good also !
mexican	however , we loved momocho . we had 3 kids with us and they accommodated us by giving us a nice large table upstairs . the food was unique , yet had the traditional mexican flavors . if you love guacamole , you need to try the samples . i also had their beef tongue which was tender and flavorful . you have to love the luchador theme of the place . we met the owner and he was really cool . he talked to my whole family outside and even took a picture with us . any guy who has never been to mexico and open up a mexican restaurant and pull it off deserves to be praised ! ¡ muy bien !
mexican	being from southern california , my expectations for burritos are extremely high ; faustos is the only place in vegas that meets those expectations .
mexican	) impressed with the quality of food here . don 't hesitate if you are looking for super taste and good prices . the rotisserie chicken is superb ... awesome plantains ... delicious chaufa . this is a must-try restaurant !
mexican	handmade tortillas , queso compuesto and a variety of unique sauces for enchiladas ( or chips ! ) are the pillars of its greatness . and don 't forget amazingly fresh tortilla chips and salsa and of course , the dot and swirl margaritas ! stop by weekdays from 4-7 to enjoy the free queso bar- you won 't regret it ! the fun atmosphere and funky decor works for date night , family night or any night ! !
mexican	all the food was tasty , hot and well prepared . the margaritas were very good as were the chips and salsa . the service wasn 't very good but not terrible , just not very attentive .
mexican	well , i think i found it . they also serve soyrizo for vegetarians . simply wonderful , the salsa bar is awesome , salsa is tasty and it seemed to transport me home . i like it , will be back without a doubt ! nummy
mexican	slots are ok never really won there , but the margaritas make up for it .
mexican	so we reviewed yelp and found this place . we decided to give it a try .. the food was good with great favor . they had a very friendly staff . i considered the plates to be over priced but we were in vegas so i guess that 's excusable . but i have never heard of $ 16 a doz . tamales but they were huge .
mexican	tortilla fish is quality food and their sides & toppings are off the hook ! the self serve salsa bar is what makes your fish tacos , incredible ! we came on a monday right before noon i believe ? we made it just in time before the crowd ! pretty sure the wait would have been really long . next time i come to az again , i will def stop by this spot ! thank you tortilla fish !
mexican	i 'm not sure i found that here , but what i did find was fabulous . great retro styling and a lively atmosphere make for a comfortable setting . i had time on both of my visits to try a couple different aguas frescas my favorite was pineapple with tequila . highlights were , the pork taco and tortilla soup . both were amazing ! the cucumber salad gets an honorable mention as well . the could have been a little better , was the baja fish taco . it was a bit boring in taste . if i 'm ever back in phoenix i will be stopping back for a great time .
mexican	after eating here , we won 't have to look any further ! the fish was incredibly tasty , no fishy and light . we had the fish tacos and macadamia nut mahi mahi . both were great ! plus the service was friendly and very helpful . decent kids menu too which was a surprise ! we will be back again .
mexican	they have a very nice patio with the inside being a little small . the service was not the greatest ( did find out our server was bartending too ) . i ordered the burrito al pastor with rice . it was amazing ! the burrito was spicy but the meat was very flavorful & the burrito wasn 't over loaded with extras . the rice was unique with cilantro & pineapple . my wife ordered mushroom quesadilla & that too was very flavorful ! the cheese used was very rich ! the price was just right too ! can 't wait to stop back !
mexican	we were on vacation in edinburgh and our apartment rental was literally right across the street from el cartel . after reading reviews , seeing it packed daily , and eventually craving mexican , we decided to try it out . it did not disappoint . probably the best guacamole i 've ever had . the waitress informed me on how scarce and difficult mexican restaurants are in the uk and after hearing this , i was that much more impressed . keep up the good work el cartel .
mexican	unfortunately most of the burrito joints in gta are a bit too hygienic in consistency and often lack the kick i 'm used to . burro absolutely nails it ! i have been able to try about the whole menu and have had a great meal every time . my absolute favorite though is the mole burrito . the manager and staff have always been incredibly nice and helpful every time i visit . i absolutely would recommend burro to anyone looking for a great cheap and filling mexican experience .
mexican	only drawback is the menu is small ( no fajitas for example ) , but if you are looking for good chips and salsa and a good enchilada then look no further . keep in mind this place looks like a complete hole , and only takes cash . enjoy !
mexican	the food is so tasty with great flavor . i have been there a few times with my wife and we always leave with our stomachs more than satisfied . the service is also great . we always enjoy ourselves when we go .
mexican	amazing corn cakes with caramel and coconut sprinkles ! also cold inca kola : )
mexican	this place is fantastic ! it 's a small hole in the wall place that we found on yelp . the food tastes home cooked . for appetizers we had the shrimp ceviche and the nachos supremos with chicken . they were both delicious ! for dinner i chose the steak picado and my husband had the carne asada and cheese enchiladas . both plates came with rice and refried beans . we enjoyed the savory carne in both dishes . the flour tortillas were homemade and very tasty . this place will be added to my very small list of good mexican restaurants ! !
mexican	i ordered the green chili taco , steak taco , bacon poblano street corn and a pitcher of sangria ( to share with a friend ) . everything was good except i wish the corn had more cheese and mayo throughout the entire corn . the restaurant is super cute and i am a little obsessed with all of the decor . they even brought the cuteness to the bathroom with quotes that read " hola bonita " i will be going back again to try more options on the menu . brownie point or should i say pan dulce points for staying open late !
mexican	upon entering i was greeted by a smiling face and an emphatic welcome . in one swoop olivia put together the perfect bowl for after very minimal direction . at the end of that effortless assembly , in stride she asks someone who was standing behind her if she could comp my order and finishing that effortless movement handed me my order and insisted pleasantly that i have a great night . i don 't typically have time for reviews but olivia left an impression on me . props to chipotle for a hell of a hire and thank you , olivia . you have a very bright future in whatever you pursue .
mexican	margaritas are delicious , i enjoy getting a sampler as they always have something new to try . the wild boar nachos are the best thing on the menu and the huevos rancheros is the best version of this dish around ! i 'm personally not too into the tamales or taquitos , my fiancé loves it , but the salsas , guacs , and nachos are so good they usually end up being my meal . i recommend coming for happy hour and definitely trying the brunch
mexican	good food , excellent service , i cannot rave enough over this gem . i had the rib tip tacos , and some chips and guac . - not only was everything delicious , but served with a smile and very quickly . good portion size , excellent taste and outstanding customer service make the stand a stand out whenever i am in this part of town .
mexican	this place is really good the flautas where amazing and the beans and rice are authentic only drawbacks are the non traditional chips which are not that good and our server only came around once to check on us . and if your mexican the lack of real mexican music might piss you off lol no mariachi , banda or norteno only rock en español from south america , it 's like if you go to a bbq joint and there playing techno it 's just not the right music lol
mexican	rice is so so sweet as the beautiful girl suggested that they can severe half jerk chicken and goat curry . loved the food . keep smiling and serving the best food
mexican	service : outstanding . always fast and friendly , with bottomless chips and salsa that actually get refilled . food : the food is standard mexican fare , done simple and well . while you won 't find anything truly amazing , everything i 've tried has been delicious , well thought out , and ready quickly . value : this is where they truly shine . the prices are unbeatable for what you get , and the daily special gets you out the door for about $ 6 , without leaving you hungry . try whatever is on special that day if you aren 't sure , and chances are you 'll be pleased .
mexican	so to start off the place is busy on sat night first come first serve no reservations expect a line but it 's popular so it 's expected.the are a lot of choices from steaks , sandwiches , seafood paella , and appetizers . we got the paella with a side of beef empanadas and some ribs which were all good . the place is byob which is a plus . i will have to return again some time and try a steak to give it a full review but it was good . the place for the record is young and youthfull with music playing and isn 't by far a quiet romantic place . it 's all part of great food and great service .
mexican	we were not disappointed at all ! from great service ( our waiter was carlos ) , to excellent food , we will be going back !
mexican	the whole family was glad we did . i ordered a couple tacos one carne asada and one carnitas . both were delicious . i especially enjoyed the carnitas but both were delicious . my husband and son both had burritos and after seeing them it left me wishing i had ordered one myself even if they were big ( lunch for the next day ) . my daughter loved the enchilada plate that came with rice and beans . there were many different types of salsa in the salsa bar and the restaurant was clean and well decorated . i only wish we could have enjoyed our meal with a beer . we will definitely be back though the food was that good .
mexican	this place is my new favorite ! great value too !
mexican	i had my doubts . this small family run establishment had a great simple atmosphere with people enjoying their meal and drinks . the food was surprisingly good . i had the carne asada and it was cooked to perfection on top of a bed of black bean rice . something i haven 't had before was grilled cheese strips . they ask if you want this when you order . they really shouldn 't ask , it 's great .
mexican	don juan you guys are ...... as close to authentic as you can get in this area ... i do enjoy the vibe of this restaurant and the food is better than good the service is great .... i can tell you blow that dump nacho daddyaway . you come a close second to lindo michoacán almost tie ... but if i want real authentic i quess i have to drive to the east side of las vegas to taco el gordo or taco y taco . not putting you guys down ... but reality
mexican	i was pleasantly surprise with the taco salad . i ask for no beans and tomatoes and had the most perfect meal . come hungry because its huge .
mexican	the taco stand outside of reyna 's is good . the carne asada meat was tender , though i usually prefer a little more char . a friend i was with got the beef tongue , a little too eccentric for my taste , but he loved it . surprisingly , i really enjoyed the tortilla . i am usually tuned off by corn tortillas , but theirs are soft , not dry , and don 't fall apart as the taco juices seep in . in other words exactly what you need for a good street taco . the best part is the taco barrista squeezes fresh lime juice on top of the taco as a finishing touch . it really puts it over the top .
mexican	these are not those . these street tacos are so very tasty . i tried them for the first time last night and voila ! my tastebuds were dancing and i was in a happy place . go here and let your tastebuds experience what i too have uncovered . ( really good street tacos - i had the tinga and carnitas . both were excellent but i slightly preferred the carnitas )
mexican	being raise on tamales i have had many in my lifetime and some were good bad and ugly but these tamales pork green chili and pork red chili are the best i have ever had .. the masa was amazing the taste was so soft sweet and oh so perfect .. melts in your mouth .. this is the only place i will ever get tamales .. thank you the tamale shop for your tlc and the best tamales ive ever had i will be back and back and back and try many of your other choices
mexican	first time i went , i was pleasantly surprised at the authenticity of the food . the carne asada tacos were cooked perfectly , had great flavor , as did the pork carnitas . their salsa is good ... a little mild--ask for the hot , you 'll love it . only thing i would recommend is dialing down the music a bit as it 's a little loud if you 're talking biz .
mexican	what sets this location apart from others is the staff and speed . they are fast ! ! even during the lunch rush , you will have order in hand in less than 2 minutes . love this location . best of the best in my opinion .
mexican	that being said , sylvia 's burritos are some of the best i 've had . i quite enjoy the serve yourself chips ( have as much as you want ) and the beer selection . i had a simple veggie burrito- scrumptious . i saved half for the next day 's lunch and it was just as good as the night before . oh sylvia , i wish i could whisk you away to sf .
mexican	excellent service . loved the ambiance and the colombian music playing in the back ground . the owner took time to talk with us and share about her and her husbands business . they 've been in business for 4yrs and have seen it grow rapidly . it 's a great place to experience and taste a bit of colombia !
mexican	) but this place is phenomenal . from the moment you walk in it feels very welcoming w / a good vibe . the place is plush and very spacious . besides the cool decor , people really come here because the food is always on point . eldorado advertises that they use organic / gmo free products and you can taste that quality in their food . little more pricier than say lindo but its worth it if you want to try something different . the molé and guacamole are must tries .
mexican	we ordered a bunch of dishes tapas style - seabass with peruvian corn , quinotto , chicken anticuchos , yellowtail ceviche and el topo roll . food was pretty flavorful and creative , being a true fan of peruvian cuisine it was a little off especially the ceviche but seabass with peruvian corn was the favorite all around . mixed drinks were great especially the pisco sours and caiprinhas . overall great place for tapas , most portions are small .
mexican	i love their breakfast burritos so that is my go to when visiting roberto 's . they always seem to cook the bacon to that perfect crispness , as it should be and they don 't load it up with cheese , just the way i like it . i have tried a few other locations that just do not compare to this one .
mexican	love the food . patio os great in summer . if you are not brazilian ( like me ) or not into brazilian soccer , better try to avoid games night .
mexican	great service and they spoke to me in spanish and english to see what i perfered . bf got the taco which you dress yourself inside which is great . then he got the combo plate of red tamale and enchilada which were tasty . i got the pollo loco which has a kick and ranchers beans which were s little salty but still edible . good service
mexican	from the outside , the place looks like a small joint crammed into a corner unit of a plaza but looks can be deceiving . once you walk in , the restaurant is beautiful . bright with light and some fine looking people . ; ) had a bottle of red wine ( can 't recall the name of the deliciously sweet wine ) to accompany the great tasting dish of gnocchi al ragu .
mexican	s hard to find a good meal where meat is dominant . but they were very accommodating and it was all delicious ! ! we will go back . the vegetarian burrito was especially good , it had mashed potatoes in it making it creamy and almost cheesy and bursting with flavor . ollie was a great waiter as well !
mexican	we had the avocado tacos and chile relleno and were very impressed . we also tried couple of their cocktails and they were so good - unique in taste and the server took his time to answer our questions . would def go back to this place !
mexican	it 's very authentic and the server was super nice and had the heaviest caraqueño accent , which i wish i had . try the perico with ham and cheese arepa . it 's always been my favorite and you don 't find it at most north american venezuelan restaurants . it 's something my mum would make . they are short of a star because they didn 't have natilla ( venezuelan sour cream / creme cheese ) , empanadas . oh and because no one makes better arepas than my mum ! !
mexican	best in phoenix . as evidenced by the long lines ( waited 10 minutes on a saturday even after calling ahead ! ) . get the red and green salsas and enjoy !
mexican	sure , it 's dirty . sure , there 's only outdoor seating and sure , there are occasional bullet holes in the ceilings , but nevertheless the food is always the same ; greasy drunken night goodness ! i love you filly b 's ! you always know to keep me regular .
mexican	there are a lot of great tacos to select from with unique flavor combinations and it was fun to try a variety ! i would love to frequent belair more often but until the wait slows down ( or i start eating dinner at 4 ) i 'm going to have to sit this one out . must try taco : ninja pig and fried avocado & bacon !
mexican	get anything with kim chee and be in heaven . i dont know how they thought this shtuff up , but its brilliant . perfect combo of mex and korean . 10star food , takeout for me , but amazing ! top pick in vegas for me ! !
mexican	i think i found one here ! the decor was great ! beautiful pond and geese with the authentic mexican blankets and tile . it was like wonka 's chocolate factory ... looked small from the outside then opened to this huge area on the inside ! i ordered the tequila shrimp dish . 5 or so big shrimp and yummy veggies on the side . 3 different salsa types with hot chips . service was average + but not out of this world . prices were reasonable i guess ... could always be a bit lower , especially with this location being a ways out . it was pretty full on a thursday night , however . after i finished my meal , i understood why !
mexican	however , this place has passed the test . the food truly has a kick to it , and the best part : they left out the chewy fatty meat bites , and greasy make-you-feel-sick-afterwards slime . have you every seem a non-greasy chimmi ? if you like spice , you need to try los dos molinos .
mexican	will be coming back everyday for the convenience , speed and quality of the location . might get pizza at one point but for now the burritos are doing it for me .
mexican	everyone raves about chipotle and i too can see why . is it my favorite ? probably not . i 'm a moe 's fan really when it comes to burritos . they do have great fresh ingredients and the staff is as kind and friendly as any you will find though . this location i imagine can be a bit of trouble getting in and out of considering it 's location is on a busy corner with the met across the street .
mexican	these tacos are delicious flavorful and fresh . it 's difficult to be a sane human being and not eat more than 5 . my favorites are the chorizo and beef shoulder with all toppings . not familiar with the menu ? the staff will help you decide with the choices . the place is 0 frills and all about the food . seating is limited and nothing special so don 't expect anything fancy . just come here hungry and ready for fantastic tacos .
mexican	awesome tacos . ordering is broken into three lines , with respective meats listed . if there 's a line , yeah , it 's gonna take awhile . be prepared for that . basic taqueria , though . you 've got the delicious tacos , a few other items to choose from , and a beverage fountain . seating is open , a few booths and tables .
mexican	... being that it 's off the strip , bring patience too because this location gets busy and if you 're not in a group , you 'll need patience to navigate the taco lines . by that , you 'll need to know which taco you want in order to get in the correct taco line . the chorizo and al pastor tacos are king and rule the menu . the carne asada tacos are ok .... a little bit more seasoning would be nice , but hey , they 're still delicious . seating is limited and nothing special so don 't expect anything fancy . just come here hungry and ready to eat good food . especially if you choose the al pastor meat .
mexican	cafe rio has great food . i 've tried several of the items on their menu and have never been disappointed . my mouth is watering as i write this review thinking about the delicious sweet pork . they have lunch specials that change with the day of the week . i believe tuesdays are coconut shrimp taco day , and those are by far my favorite lunch special . i always get a side of their creamy tomatillo dressing to dip my tacos in ! try it ! the only reason i 'm knocking off a star is for their slow lunch service . it takes 20 - 25 minutes sometimes to get thru the lunch line !
mexican	carne sandwich is amazing . try all four sauces . i can 't decide which is my favorite . they are all distinct and amazing . get the toast for a buck and dip in all the sauces . staff is super friendly and helpful . awesome spot .
mexican	i had the mini street tacos and the jefe burrito . they were delicious . i think i " m hooked . i have to say the jefe burrito is the best burrito i have ever had . they are totally worth the price . the service is amazing .
mexican	i ordered the carne sandwich with filet mignon steak and was astounded ! the steak was cooked to a juicy medium rare . the peppers were charcoaled perfectly . the caramelized onions were sweet and savory . the chimichurri added a nice bitter taste . and the bread absorbed all the juices and allowed all of the different flavors to stand out in unison . this was one of the best sandwiches i 've ever had . it 's undoubtedly the best sandwich i 've had in pittsburgh . i 'm not even sure we should refer to it as a sandwich considering how transcendental it is .
mexican	i tried every taco they had , all were amazing . they were jamming some mexican soap opera on the two tvs while i waited for my food which was new for me . i ordered seven of those bad boys and plowed through them like they were my last meal on death row .
mexican	it 's a small place , with no fountain drinks ( they have cans ) , in a neighborhood that is questionable and none of it matters . there could be bears in the bushes , snipers on the rooftop and landmines through the parking lot and it 'd still be worth it here . what 's good ? everything . what 's cheap ? everything . the sauces make amazing food better . get this food to go ( call ahead , it takes a little bit ) and then drive to tenaya creek brewery for amazing beer . you must do this . i want to go back right now .
mexican	believe the hype ... i 've only been in twice , both times with a line out the door , and most recently had one of the most deeply satisfying filet con pan ( sandwich ) i can ever recall , along with a side of spicy caramelized brussel sprouts , i share the overwhelming love expressed for gaucho .
mexican	meat is so juicy the green sauce get extra of that bomb ! the spicy pork is so good i 've tried taco y taco & some were saying it 's pretty much the same no ! it sure isn 't el gordo is thee best from taste , favor & & hey it ain 't open late for no reason . i live in cali & the husband i go to gardena it 's called the " taco truck " & we love that place we believe el gordo tops that place . so try it real good !
mexican	not much to add from other reviewers . plan to wait in line . it moves fast but there is always a line . bring a bottle of wine , no corkage fee . get the mushrooms side dish . i 'd try to recommend other items but everything i 've had is equally delicious . it 's also extremely reasonable pricing . go and enjoy .
mexican	the tacos are small but so flavorful and perfect for the price . i could eat the carnitas everyday . the staff is very friendly and helpful when i can 't make up my mind . my favorite place when i need a taco fix . go early and avoid the crowds
mexican	this place is fantastic . it 's drive past my exit on 51 and keep going until i hit mcdowell good . the carne asada is always perfectly done . the calabacitas tacos can convince kids to eat all their veggies .
mexican	this place is fantastic . we ordered the brunch and a sandwich . both of which had a beautiful array of flavours . hella recommend this spot
mexican	( bonus : their arepas are gluten free ) . great decor , small back patio , amazing menu ( byob fyi ) , and talented servers who leave you alone to enjoy your meal instead of rushing you through .
mexican	totally authentic vibe . incredible smokey , grilled flavors . delicious sauces and seasonings . this is a meat-lovers paradise .
mexican	every plate was not only pleasing to the eye but to the palate as well . the portions were more than abundant and the service was excellent . there was even a singing guitarist that entertained us both in spanish an english . every employee at this restaurant made sure to welcome us and make sure we had everything we needed even though we weren 't in their area . it 's agreed that it was the best mexican food in the area . a + from our table .
mexican	food was good queso was a bit thick and could have been a little warmer .
mexican	he was very kind and exactly what makes a visit to wahoos a positive experience . keep up the good work ! food was good as always
mexican	but the food and atmosphere was fantastic . thanks ben .
mexican	i really like spicy and the food is very flavorful . i 'm kinda bummed to see so many negative reviews due to the spice content because they are proud of their spicy content . i personally have been many times and each has been an excellent experience to my palate ; i try something new each time i go too . but don 't go with a gringo tongue if you don 't like spicy then complain after getting burnt , kinda like being mad if a bear bites you after poking it .
mexican	the pupusas area very reasonable and a good size . i like the chicken one the best . the entrees are also large . i ordered the bistec ( steak ) and my boyfriend ordered the pescado ( whole fried fish ) . the proteins and the refried beans were delicious . the rice was fine . the meals come with corn tortillas which is a lot of food . be prepared to take food home-good thing the food is great for leftovers and to re cook into an omelet . finally , adding the picked vegetables was great-i didn 't care too much for the sauce they have you .
mexican	this is my 2nd time here , and they make the food as you order , so u get piping hot , fresh pupusas ! u can see them making the dough , and forming them as you order . what i like are that they also have vegetarian pupusas , which most places do not , and if they do its just bean / cheese . this place had " sucini " ones among others which is how they spelled " zucchini " and it was delicious ! also , prices are really great for what i order !
mexican	the food is made to order and tastes homemade . i love the refried black beans . my husband and i usually share the sampler platter ... we love the variety . the food is interesting . for instance , a pickled cabbage slaw is served with all dishes . the plantain chips , stuffed pepper , papusas , and ceviche with fresh chips are also good . the only thing i haven 't loved was the onion chicken . i definitely recommend if you are in the neighborhood !
mexican	al pastor is fantastic , some of the best tacos i have had . very limited seating with the amount of people that come here , but very worth it !
mexican	be prepared to wait .... the line was sooooooo long that after an extended amount of time we had to leave ... i do want to come back when we are not in any schedule
mexican	there are no reservations and the line is out the door on a saturday night . we waited about two hours . i loved the food and there is a choice of small and big portions , so nice to not have too much food . i had a veggie sandwich and my hubby had a yummy steak . the potatoes and chimi sauce was great . bring your own bottle and everyone does . you order in line and food is brought to you . even seated , service is a little slow . but food was great and i would return . a fun place and very friendly staff .
mexican	" delicious tacos " & carne asada fries to boot . be fore warned a small order was big enough ... lol
mexican	even at 3 in the morning the line is absurd ! ! and there is no organization people are just everywhere . my girl who swore these are the best tacos ... we came & tried them out . and they were okay . i can live without it . the green sauce is good , without the food would be bleeeeh .
mexican	debit machine went down . i said i 'd go get cash , they brought food out to my wife while i was gone and i made sure i went in to pay even tho they didn 't sweat it . carne asada tacos are the best . i had five like a true fatty . great flavor.super cheap . i wanted to eat so badly i took pic half way thru . go there and have a good time
mexican	my lunch to go was taking a while , i was watching everyone else get theirs , and then the manager walked up to me to apologize for the delay , explaining that the tilapia took a little longer , and then she handed me a card for a free entree !
mexican	besides language barriers ... it was a fast to order in tonight for my family ( just can 't wait for them to get their grub on )
mexican	every person i 've brought here loves the food and later asks for the name of the restaurant & cross streets so that they can come back again .
mexican	glad we didn 't leave due to all the negative reviews .
mexican	the staff was extremely friendly . the cashier taking my order was very patient and very helpful in helping me decide what to order . will definitely come back again and again as i am frequently here for work .
mexican	i order two things here .. tacos and quesadilla .... i normally do not eat quesadilla , but here its something else ... cheese , moist and perfectly seasoned asada , with grilled sauteed onions all between a light crisp homemade tortilla ? ! ? what else can be better ? ? well , maybe there are other things : ) but for this moment , during my 15 sec of fame ... i mean review .... lets amuse ourselves : ) go ... you will not be disappointed
mexican	we had the ' pescado y camaron veracruz ' and alone the plate with the main dish was huge ! rice & beans on the side of course . the seafood juice was well heated and the shrimps were large and food proportioned . the desert was to die for if you order the ' churro with ice cream ' your mouth will water .
mexican	alexander is the best bartender on earth ! he is always attentive and friendly .
mexican	the food was great- the salsa was so flavorful . also , the staff is very friendly . definitely wouldn 't take my boyfriend here hahah but the food was great .
mexican	i have had both the columbian , and the wunderhund . i would suggest them both and i intend to try the rest . braut 's are cooked perfectly , buns are steam puffed but not soggy , and the toppings are new combinations for me but i love the way they work together .
mexican	everything is made fresh and tastes amazing ! you can easily order 4-6 tacos and devour them yourself ! tacos are $ 1 and mini quesadillas are $ 2 . both are topped with cabbage , hot salsa , and guac . don 't forget to ask for the grilled onions and jalapeños .
mexican	ask for the grilled jalapeños . this is coming from a san franciscan where our mission district tacos are on point and authentic . located in a plaza with lots of parking . to avoid the lines go during the day . if you go late night , everyone and their mama will be there !
mexican	i always et the iguana dish with the chicken enchiladas , refrained beans , rice and cheese sauce . best pico de gallo and salsa i 've ever had ! !
mexican	the the two large chicken enchiladas with salad on the side was plenty . service and outside dining was great .
mexican	best adobada tacos i 've had in vegas.the workers are friendly , the place is clean & open late.their radishes are huge by the way lol
mexican	period . open ' til 4am on weekends , always packed with people . i 've only ever had the large steak burritos , but i can 't imagine any other kind could be better !
mexican	really good authentic cheap mexican food . good horchata ! good salsa ! good food ! the long lines at 2am are definitely worth it .
mexican	it 's a hole in the wall place in a shopping center . he decor is very colorful and the service was great ! will definitely come back here when we 're in town again .
mexican	during a layover to cabo , decided to start the fiesta early . excellent chips / guac and delicious chicken tortilla soup , washed down with a refreshing barrio blonde . fast , polite service .
mexican	eclectic mexican in a nice environment--given it 's an airport . highly recommmended !
mexican	? ! you 're in an airport and buying alcohol did you expect it being cheap ? ! ? ! for an airport place it has great food , i had the chicken poblano burrito wife had pork tacos ... they we 're both outstanding ! yes a bit expensive but again you 're in an airport ! as far as it replacing wendy 's ? ? ? ? are ya kidding me ? ! ? ! hell yes ! go to sleep ! ! !
mexican	i think i 'd order the tikka tofu burrito again even outside an airport
mexican	best all around tacos i 've had in a while. firstly the ingredients are fresh fresh. secondly they are really tasty. and lastly its just a buck for a one of em. i 'm usualy a fan of carnita but they really make a good al pastor here. some of the best mole sauce i 've ever had anywhere. very well rounded flavor - almost like an indian curry dish. just one complaint - if they call the place nopalito they should be serving nopal. and why dont they have tamales ?
mexican	great menu choices , fresh , friendly staff , and great orchata ! they switched to cash only though a few months back so heads up !
mexican	i 'd give this place a 5 but there are so many mexican food establishments around , i will wait to see who it the real 5 ; ) i have always had good food with good prices and service here !
mexican	thank god i live 5 min away . 4 tacos and a horchata please ....
mexican	best al pastor ive ever had .... great food , cheap prices. friendly service and very clean. loved this place , we were in town for spring training and seem it on dd plus a co worker told me about it. we will def be back when in az .
mexican	amazing . service was quick and on point . almost like an in-n-out of mexican food . few choices : tacos , mulas , sopes , tostadas , fríes . then you get to pick their meat choices : too many to name . but the al pastor was by far my favorite . lots of seating and right by the freeway . and on the other side of the strip ( avoid crazy traffic and crowds ) . great spot .
mexican	don 't be intimidated . .. just walk up to the windows n they will give samples .
mexican	the gourmet ones are good for gringos but not this gringo . try the jamaica and horchata waters . don 't forget about there happy hour deals . the service is mostly bad , they have one good server , but the food is worth it . come with an open mind and don 't come if your used to be pampered .
mexican	i tried one chicken taco , one al pastor and one carne asada . all were delicious but i should have just ordered 3 al pastor with pineapple and the medium ( orange ) salsa because it did not get better than that ! also , great horchata and super friendly staff .
mexican	( even better than el gordo ! ) always ask for pineapple slices ! chicken , chorizo & carne asada are all amazing as well. if you are not sure which one you like best ask for a sample ! i have been here 3 times ! this place is legit . i will be back for more !
mexican	the carne asada are good too , but ap are my absolute favorite , especially with some lime squeezed on top ! mmmmmhm ! just the thought of them makes me hungry even if i 'm full !
mexican	we walked into this place around 1am after walking the strip all day and we were starving . not only were the tacos great but the staff is friendly , they move fast and the food is cheap .. not like those $ 30 + dollar buffets along the strip . definately worth a trip- you won 't be dissappointed .
mexican	the ordering is a little confusing but the workers are very nice and helpful . in wish this place was closer to my house because i would go here every day if i could .
mexican	i followed the advice of yelpers in the search for the best place for tacos , it was right on , so juicy , tasty , i 'm going back for more . it is a very short walk from freemont , and i felt safe as well . highly recommend !
mexican	good stuff : this place has the best americanized mexican food in the city . large portions of enchiladas , fajitas . i think their chile rellanos are awesome . reasonable prices . bad stuff : americanized mexican food- i wouldn 't go here if you 're looking for native mexican . also , their frozen margaritas can be kind of weak . stick with beer or on the rocks price : about 30 for two with a drink overall : favorite place for fast , fill up your belly , americanzied mexican in the city . i usually go to this branch but have been to the one in independence and it was exactly the same ......
mexican	thank you marcus and clay ! ! ! you guys are the best ! ! food is delicious ! ! ! i have not had chilaquiles this good since a year ago in puertovallarta mexico ! !
mexican	not too authentic but delicious ! super nice and friendly staff . great food and atmosphere so i 'm definitely coming back
mexican	the menudo didn 't have enough meat but i honestly can 't complain it was still delicious . i 've been ordering the burritos lately because the are delicious and i 've never had a tortilla like it . i can 't recommend this place enough !
mexican	any time any day . specially on their breakfast burritos monday-friday $ 2.99 ( 7am to 11am ) regular price $ 4.99 to $ 5.99 & great variety on them also .
mexican	source : i grew up and lived 26 years in mexico city . the weekend barbacoa is phenomenal , just like home . huaraches , sopes , menudo and tortas are all great and authentic . as for tacos , they are as authentic as you can get them in the carolinas .
mexican	( i love rick bayless 's places in chicago , i think he 'd approve ! ) love the tlacoyo , sopes , and quesadillas . tortillas are freshly made , with masa , not the prepackaged factory made ones . this is almost impossible to find these days , even in mexico ! cu is lucky ! guac is good .. queso fundido is fantastic . when asked grilled or fried , ask for fried . trust me . cons : very small , always packed , only counter top / bar stool seating , which is hard if you have kids or want to go with a group .
mexican	love the fried shrimp tacos and queso dip ! ! !
mexican	i have tried the burritos both ways , with rice and with noodles and have to say , i 'm a fan of the noodles . i have eaten there twice so far , the first time i tried the chicken , the second time i tried the vegan burrito . both are incredibly filling as the burritos from chino locos are stuffed to the max with fresh ingredients . i end up only making it through half . best thing to do is sit at the tiny bar ( that seats two people ) , grab a limonata , chit chat with the owner and savour the goodness that is chino locos
mexican	i visited this place while on was on a business trip to phoenix . a buddy of mine said to try it and boy was i glad we did . shawarma beef and chicken tasted like it came straight from the home land . very tender and full of flavor . wish i lived closer to this place . i would eat there every day .
mexican	we tried an assortment - veggie , black bean / cheese , shrimp - all delicious . the plantains were perfectly fried and sweet . the owner was so friendly and even threw in a side of yuca fries when we told him we were visiting from out of town . it 's a short uber ride away and definitely worth it . only complaint is that it 's a little warm inside , they need to crank up the ac . everything else was perfect !
mexican	went with the pulled pork and cheese and the beef and cheese . it was incredible . very juicy meats and moist , tasty , corn cakes that had the essential griddle crunch on the outside . 4.50 or so per arepa-- take advantage of it . cachapas were also very flavorful and slightly sweet .
mexican	i love the burritos especially the carne asada or chicken . it 's huge and delicious . they are open 24 hrs so it 's perfect late at night . i recommend this place to anyone .
mexican	just wish they would have more authentic dishes since they do so well with the typical fare .
mexican	salsa great ! beans and rice , the basis of mexican food was perfect . my combination plate was savory , spicy and kept me wanting more . after years of eating at the other local mexican restaurants , this is the one the competition should worry about !
mexican	crinkle cut heaven ! plus it 's open late . don 't forget the green chile
mexican	all the meats are great and i 'm pausing after taco number 2 to write this so i can savor the flavor . i live in san diego ( taco capitol of the us ) this is greatttt ! ! ! ! make sure to try the pepper / onion salsa st the salsa bar . amazing ! ! ! my new go to place for my business trips . see you next month ! !
mexican	they use prime beef and the freshest ingredients . i eat here 3-4 times a week . i won 't eat another taco in mesa .
mexican	can 't wait to go back to try the rest . interesting setup , you order from the trailer out front , but you can eat inside of there brick and mortar that 's in the same lot
mexican	i always have a craving for jarritos when i eat the tacos here . yum !
mexican	the asada had the grilled taste a taco should have and homemade tortillas , all the fixins available .... rice is on point for me im jus happy i found this place ... open late too .
mexican	we eat here as often as we can . it 's a 40 min drive for us , but well worth the effort . great chicken , pork , and carne asada . when friends come in from out of town this is our go to place !
mexican	i have been to all . the menu contains a broad selection of colombian dishes that are second to none . the staff was helpful and courteous in explaining the dishes . i was totally impressed and would recommend casablanca colombia to all my friends !
mexican	been coming here for a couple years now and the food is amazing . i always get the jerk chicken with a side of rice and beans , mac and cheese , and fried plantains . you could sit inside and enjoy your food but the grocery is pretty small so i wouldnt recommend it . the people who work there do have a bit of an attitude but i dont mind it when the food is this good . i recommended this place to everyone i know !
mexican	but tapas wise , this one offers the most variety and great quality ) . takoyaki ( fried octopus ) is consistently good . tonkatsu ramen is best in town !
mexican	forget ikea ! lol . this is fresh - delicious - great service and super friendly owners and family ! i will bring all my friends and family here for years to come without hesitation ! this place does not cut corners . they make the food only once it has been ordered . this is a truly a great place and i never write reviews since finding amazing places is rare for me . this place makes it worth sharing ! go try it ! 5 stars !
mexican	they have so many optins . go with the chicken mole verde . it is delcious . enchiladas rock , the alambra is good too . shrimp cocktail isnt that great though- i 've had much better .
mexican	and you can 't beat the low prices . my go-to for mexican .
mexican	i love this place , it 's my first time here and i am definitely coming back ! ! ! i 'm so happy i found them on yelp ! !
mexican	family owned and operated . this place is a hidden madison gem .
mexican	the service was the best . good prices , too !
mexican	the staff is great and the food is always done in 5 minutes . they have excellent flavor in all their food . and the carrots are to die for . if you want a great , fast , mexican meal , go here . and the portions are a great size , so you won 't leave feeling let down .
mexican	it 's like home style cooking which nothing beats that ! ! ! had the carne asada plate and omg was the meat was amazing super soft and tender ! ! beans and rice were great also gonna start bringing people here . real review from a real mexican from el paso texas !
mexican	very inexpensive . the sisters that work there are really friendly and make you feel like you are coming into there home . every time i go there i leave with a smile on my face . it really doesn 't get any better then this place . cannot save enough good things about this place . it is a must stop to visit .
mexican	i can 't say enough great things about espos . my family and i have been enjoying their food for 10 + years . my co-workers and i frequently have lunch here . the tamales around the holidays are perfect , order ahead of time if you can . we love the chorizo , machaca beef and anything with green chili . never disappointed . i 'm salivating just writing this post ... espos , here i come !
mexican	we had tacos and carne asada fries and we were sad that this was our last day in vegas .
mexican	masa for tamale was old style absolutely wonderful . husband had nachos which came in a fry bread bowl , huge ! he said they were the very best . refried beans are outstanding and all there sauces were excellent . will go back any time we can . also they use real cheese not imitation .
mexican	would have gave this place 5 stars on flavor alone . however customer service at the register is hurting . and no bathrooms . i doubt we will ever be returning for these 2 reasons alone .
mexican	i have nothing bad to say about this place . great food . great service . fast and friendly .
mexican	get the queso sauce with chips and the chicken fajitas . the salsa is so good you could drink it plain ! good prices too , especially the lunch specials !
mexican	check it out and try the manta tacos ! i 've been to dozens of mexican restaurants in the valley and none are as authentic as this place . the salsa is hot as you want or mild for the less daring . this is a regular stop for me and my wife whenever we crave mexican .
mexican	they have an amazing salsa bar with flavors i never could have thought to be salsas . i have the mahi burro and it was awesome . everything made from scratch down to the tortillas . it 's in a kind of " rough " location , but don 't let that stop you from this place !
mexican	i 'm set in my ways and get the carne asada burrito every time ( been going here 6 years ) , and it has never disappointed . they don 't pack your burro full of potatoes or beans , but instead you 'll get tons of good beef with the perfect balance of onion and beans . love the beans . oh , and regardless the item on the menu , you 'll leave very full for under $ 7 bucks .
mexican	i would typically travel the ways to don ponchos for some bomb.com type of food . i found their replacement . must try spot . tacos on point along with their menudo and burritos . the pastor has flavor like no other , that alone has me coming back for more .
mexican	food is full of flavor , i can 't pick between the shrimp ceviche or shrimp tacos or caldo de birria very hard but those are deff my top 3 faves from this location . tortillas are freshly made here . if you are looking for very tasty food deff recommend it .
mexican	best authentic mexican food in town , home made tortillas are the best , friendly service and make sure to try the flan .
mexican	the food is wonderful and the margaritas are delicious ! the staff is very friendly and welcoming .
mexican	we always order tortas de pollo con todo and they are amazing ! very reasonably priced and extremely friendly & welcoming staff . very modest decor but that didn 't bother me . the food , service & price by far makes up for it .
mexican	no tex mex here , just the real thing ! went here on a date night with my wife before the movies and it was was a great experience ! the quality of food was excellent , the place was very clean , cozy atmosphere and the service was super friendly ! we will definitely return to this hidden mexican gem , " eh " ! ! !
mexican	and the horchata is delicious ! i have been to a lot of mexican places that don 't even compare . you have to try it to believe it !
mexican	i definitely recommend the camarones in chipotle sauce over rice ! poncho gave us great service ! love the fact that they are open 24 / 7 .. we will be back for sure : )
mexican	i can 't wait to try more things from their menu !
mexican	food is fresh and tasty . their margaritas are fantastic ! ! staff is very friendly and the portions are huge . this place is a must !
mexican	great service too ! the torta ahogada and the cóctel de camarones are my favorite ! we 've been trying different dishes and loved them all !
mexican	tons of option ingredients - all fresh and local . very reasonable prices . even the margaritas were great ! i recommend the pulled port . oh and the house salsa is the best .
mexican	this place is extreamly busy and loud noice with their music and the people talking , but maaan ... the food and the service is above the excellent ! stake congac and stake ranchero is the best of the grill and all the other food are very tasty and traditional touch ! !
mexican	clean , friendly and reasonable prices ! tacos and birria is what i usually order always great !
mexican	shrimp cocktail is to die for . place is hopping by 10am and it 's not a breakfast place . if you in vegas definitely worth f going of the strip grid and heading to los tacos . guacamole is real avocado not that cheap calavo
mexican	best authentic mexican food very clean place & really good service i recommend this place 100 % everything great
mexican	excellent value , great portions , and wonderful food quality and taste . they also have some of the best drink and food specials , as well as mariachi band nights . i technically give a 4.5 star because service can be just average sometimes . however the food is quick and excellent which will make up for the more straight forward service .
mexican	menudo 7 days a week . and i hate menudo mexico but will eat theirs .
mexican	you gotta try the soups , chile verde and aquas chile ! great skinny margaritas , too ! local people come to this restaurant . you can 't go wrong ! you gotta try it . no foo foo stuff here . just real mexican food ! !
mexican	super sweet staff and reasonably priced ! try the aguachiles and soñoran style shrimp , oh or the fish vera cruz style ! really you can 't go wrong , my teenage son loves the shrimp diabla ! ceviche is great too ! my husband and i eat here at least once a week and usually more a few weeks ago we realized we had been there four times in one week and thought that might be a little excessive ! lol
mexican	when i say authentic chipolte does not come to mind ( mcdonalds owns it ) "
mexican	i was told this by an authentic mexican . great tortas and good drink specials . it is small and pretty popular so be careful peak times
mexican	my coworker had the bean and cheese chimichanga , was topped with avacado , very good ! we split an empanada de queso , amazing and only 1.99 and filled an entire plate . i had the torta de pierna ... so good with extra limon and salsa verde .
mexican	i 've had the carne asada , the chips and salsa & their breakfast burritos . all of which i recommend and will be getting again . the service is great and the ambiance is what you want out of a mexican restaurant . best time to hit this place up due to my schedule is the weekend , which i 'll be doing as long as i live near south mountain !
mexican	cheap , too . on tuesdays they have a great special on tacos for lunch . don 't miss it !
mexican	10 out of 10. nothing else to say speechless .
mexican	best authentic mexican restaurant on the west side of town hands down everything is delicious , another must try are the micheladas give it a try you won 't regret it
mexican	if you want weird delicious fish tacos california style this is not your place . those are also delicious but not the same . the staff is always very nice and the food is good . also . amazing chipotle sauce .
mexican	the prices are very good but the food is amazing . ive tried literally half the menu and plan to try the rest soon . service is awesome and atmosphere is like no other in town . if you havent tried los aztecas then you gotta come out and try them .
mexican	mexican restaurants come a dime a dozen , with few who spare no expense for quality , fresh ingredients , taquerias el chino is no exception . from the moment you take a first bite , you can be sure you 're getting the best cuts of meat and the freshest cuts of vegetables . try this place once , and you 'll be sure to make taquerias el chino , a regular stop !
mexican	don 't walk , run here ! ! ! get the adobada ( spicy pork ) and carne asada with everything on it , you won 't be disappointed , especially for $ 2.10 per taco. if your thinking about $ 12 for fries , it 's totally worth it and that 's the only thing you 're gonna eat ( you 'll be full ) gooooo ~ ! *
mexican	we first tried it when it was literally in a backyard and have never stopped coming ! fresh salsa bar to top your tacos off with ! meat is always fresh and top quality !
mexican	i like ordering their carne asada quesadilla on a flour tortilla with all the dressings on it . must check out and they just open another one on las vegas blvd .
mexican	including elotes ; ) super convenient location ( trop . and pecos by b of a ) if you haven 't tried , stop by , you won 't be disappointed .
mexican	on the menu it says they even use a separate kitchen for vegan food . husband got the nachos with veggies and i got the chilequilles with potatoes . sooo good !
mexican	best chips and salsa ! my favorite restaurant ever !
mexican	was in town from atlanta and tried it . i must go back before i leave ! ! !
mexican	the meat is tasty and is of good quality . the horchata is also very good and tastes fresh . the salsa bar has a wide variety of options which are all great . definitely would recommend to anybody looking for great tasting authentic tacos ! only downside is that it is quite small with not too many tables and there is no bathroom inside .
mexican	my husband brought me there cuz he said he tried it and it was the best he 's ever had , so i had to try it for myself of course
mexican	look for the bright colorful building . can 't miss it ...
mexican	they are even better than tacos we had in mexico . if haven 't eaten here , you are missing out ! ! they make everything fresh ! ! you wait a bit for them but its worth it because fresh tacos taste different . the carnitas , beef and chorizo and potatoes are my absolute favourites . my boyfriend 's favourite is the fish . the flavour is ridiculously amazing and they give you a generous side of green and red hot sauce , chopped onions and lime and cilantro . plus they open till 10 most nights : one of the only late night places on st clair west .
mexican	i 'm from florida we don 't got much options here. and the capechona fries were delicious , if it 's 2 people just ask for a half size , it 's still huge and half the price. after you order. ur food is ready within minutes. the. u make the line to pay and afterwards you sit down and enjoy some amazing tacos. it looks like it takes forever because of the amount of people but it moves pretty quick. definatly worth every second and penny !
mexican	meat cilantro onion lime on a fresh corn shell . embrace the culture ! while your there grab some groceries and produce that is hard to find anywhere else in madison .
mexican	from some former californians , we were disappointed in charotte 's mexican cuisine , but were pleasantly surprised with la unica . i recommend the tacos to anyone and everyone and am glad we found our new favorite taco spot .
mexican	it might be hidden in the hood a little but if you want something worth your dollar portions are huge . quesadillas here are my favorite .
mexican	the meat tastes so good and i like all the toppings they have .
mexican	best mexican restaurant , so fortunate to have it here in the lake norman area !
mexican	great prices and service , too . i 'm from texas but live in west virginia and let me tell you it is hard to find mexican food like that !
mexican	seriously guys , do not visit or drive through las vegas without stopping here . i had the classic nachos with carne asada and a quesadilla with nopales ( cactus ) . two of the most delicious dishes ever . also , they have incredibly generous portion sizes and fresh ingredients . the service was fast and the staff was so friendly and helpful ! i can 't wait to come back and try everything else including the sopes , ceviche , and pozole ! yum ! thank you , panchos !
mexican	customer service is on point . my favorite pollo loco . they also have a low calorie menu that has options , not just salads . the double chicken salad has lots of flavor .
mexican	i 've tried going to other places that are closer to me but nothing compared to los favs ! and their hot sauce is amazing but super hot just a heads up ; )

mexican	rory is amazing , frank and david are excellent .
mexican	excellent and fast customer service ! for sure a neighborhood favorite !
mexican	best enchiladas suiza , red iguana in salt lake city . everything else goes to these guys . flauta app ... outstanding . burritos ... outstanding ( tied with fb burrito ) . tacos ... bulgogi would be my new favorite , if not for a tie with the carne asada . it 's true what they say . the secret is in the sauce . and the meat . and the creative combination of ingredients .
mexican	i been coming here for years and always have a wonderful experience , they also have the best fried icecream ever ! ! ! ! !
mexican	try the fish tacos ! try the quesadilla ! try everything ! ! !

mexican	nice people and good food . every togo order comes with chips and salsa
mexican	the beans and tortilla are amazing ! do yourself a favor and get it america 's way with jalapenos . absolutely delicious .
mexican	best bean burro in town for me , love it with guacamole .
mexican	i recommend enchilada style . my family had been coming here for at least 20 years , and besides when " grandma " stopped making the tacos it has always been top notch .
mexican	i could seriously live off rubios bean and cheese burritos . rubios over chipotle any day .
mexican	i have been going to elmer 's since high school , and just recently had them cater my wedding luncheon . i am so glad i did . everything was perfect and delicious , and just what i have come to expect from elmer 's . lisa was amazing to work with , and even worked with me through personal health problems and family tragedy . i love love love elmer 's tacos .

mexican	i love the great easy going setting and delicious food ! they also moved closer to my house . which is awesome !
mexican	i always get the red chili colorado . my sister always gets the salad tortilla bowl , my dad always gets the pork , and my mother orders the tortilla soup . it 's a family thing every time !
mexican	especially the beans , it is hard to find a place that has tasty , authentic beans that are not dried out . chips and salsa are highly recommended , i am an enchilada girl so i usually get that . oh and those margaritas are excellent . nice and heavy on that pour : ) the first two times we went in here the cashier was so friendly and helpful , after the third she knew us by name ! ! i feel like i am having dinner at a friends , a friend who can actually cook good mexican food ! !
mexican	this family-run business has been my favorite for over 20 years ! ! ! i love the food ! ! ! oh i almost forgot lulu 's empanadas---yummy in my tummy ! they come very close to my grandmas fried pies , which no one has been able to duplicate !
mexican	best tacos ! very friendly . never over packed . i love how they give you a snack before they bring out your meal .. this was the first taco spot i visited when i moved here from california and and returned every time i 'm . craving tacos ...
mexican	ate to bean burritos and carne asada taco and let me tell ya , a few hours later .....................................
mexican	rice was also excellent . the barbacoa and carnitas tacos rocked ! ! ! one was better but i 'm not sure which was which . cantinas always have a great atmosphere and the location is great ! ! enjoy .
mexican	not your regular bean and cheese . love the avacado , lettuce , tomato , and feta cheese . the beans were delicious also . yummy . they also delivered to my apartment .
mexican	i eat there a ridiculous amount and i can 't seem to get tired of it .
mexican	they use corona . their pork burrito is really tasty and very large . the prices are reasonable . defiantly make it a point to order chips and cheese dip .
mexican	super sweet owner / family operated . i can 't wait to sample everything on their menu . this is authentic home cooked comida !
mexican	very simple menu with authentic fresh food and friendly service . hopefully it continues to be good .
mexican	my wife is from el paso and we both love this place ! bean & cheese burrito is the best ... pretty much everything is good here . we really never get sick of it ! the franchise one 's aren 't as good so try to go to this one or the one on 7th in phx .
mexican	best , best , best resturant they attend to you right away second time being in vegas ................................... i love the strongest margaritas
mexican	no one else is even close to having that good of tacos . and not only the tacos but the salsa and guacamole is delicious . i never want to go anywhere else . if you haven 't tried it yet , do so . : )
mexican	i cannot say this enough . i recommend this place to everyone i know. home cooked , authentic and awesome .
mexican	this is not my regular tacobell but i have been here couple times and everytime i must say exceptional customer service ! ! today though this girl name caityln ! omg ! ! she made our evenings ! she made us laugh just so friendly ! ! i just want to say keep up the good work guys ! ! and you guys should train other tacobell to do the same !
mexican	this location was just remodeled and it looks great . chorizo bfast burro is awesome as well as their burritos and super nachos .
mexican	i love the tacos there , their food is the bomb , except for the customer sevice .. does girls don 't greet . other than this place is fantastic !
mexican	the meat is super soft ! just pure goodness ! have been here well over 20xs and never been disappointed !
mexican	a group of girlfriends and i went to dinner here to celebrate my birthday and it was perfect . i love mexican food which helps of course , but the atmosphere , food , and service were all awesome.there was a musician playing who had played a happy birthday tune for me even ! i look forward to going back soon !
mexican	best bloody mary i 've had in vegas ... the carnitas hash needed more carnitas but a great meal none the less
mexican	you can feel like home in there ! i tried bolinho de bacalhau and caldo verde , just amazing !
mexican	love the campeon and the patron burritos . top notch good price
mexican	it even has a drive through ! i will be a regular ! the green hot sauce compliments the machaca well .
mexican	five bucks and done to perfection . kudos to the tattooed guy who rocks out to sade as he does his stuff .
mexican	the homemade fresh guacamole was a great addition and they 3 choices of hot sauce to top it off . it was huge and very filling , was able to share with my boyfriend . the mimosa with fresh squeezed oj was delicious , but the bloody mary did not look very appealing . i will be back and it will be difficult to order anything but the burrito .
mexican	it is very simple your meat of choice , potatoes , eggs , cheese in a slightly grilled tortilla . red salsa from there bar is perfect on it . i have had other item on there menu , everything else was good but i could eat there breakfast burrito any time of day . it is a meal for me .
mexican	if it had a little more cheese i would have swore i had died and gone to heaven .
mexican	i have been here dozens of times since i have lived down the street forever and it is an old favorite . you will not be disappointed .
mexican	chorizo breakfast burrito with egg and cheese yuuuummmm . drive through is always pretty quick and staff is so sweet .
mexican	i stop here all the time and it 's consistently good .
mexican	nice cooked to order with your choice of delicious salsa . soooo good !
mexican	tortillas are so fresh and delicious . great service , reasonable prices and friendly staff .
mexican	i normally love straight mexican breakfast burritos . but i 've been eating healthy lately and i tried their beef chorizo breakfast burrito recently and i was truly amazed ! ! it was not greasy it was perfect size and amount if eggs potatoes and chorizo and their spicy mayo sauce omg amaze ! ! i will definitely go back and try more items in their menu ! ! bwt their service is awesome and fast
mexican	mad maria is spicy and delish . another great experience .
mexican	and pico de gallo is free and delicious ! always consistent , have been going for years and never had a bad meal .
mexican	this is my go to place even though it 's about 15 minutes away from my house i wouldn 't go anywhere else if i 'm craving a breakfast burrito . the tortillas taste fresh and they 're always packed to the brink of bursting with the yummy fillings ( my favorite is the bacon ) . although this place isn 't 5 star looking , it is 5 star tasting and very consistent .
mexican	ordered 30 for a company event and they were ready on time as promised !
mexican	huge & $ 4 . can 't beat that . i get the bacon & add avocado . the california chicken is amazing too . my kids love the quesadillas . they use real authentic tortillas ( probably have lard in them ) but they are soon yuum . i always take tons of their hot sauces home & use them all week . the red sauce is the best ! it 's a taco shop but cheap & good . not greasy like filibertos & armando 's
mexican	make sure to order extra egg because for some reason they scrimp on the eggs . love los favs ! !
mexican	wait can be a little long at the drive thru so don 't come here if you 're in a rush .
mexican	honestly if i could afford it i would eat their breakfast burritos every day ! my husband has gotten other items off the menu and they have all been delicious . this is my go to mexican food restaurant ! i recommend it to everyone .
mexican	it 's all about their red sauce ! ! ! ! don 't know about the rest of the food . never had it . lol !
mexican	my husband and i go here often for them . they are very large burritos with lots of eggs , meat and cheese or however you like them . im hungry now . thanks
mexican	i enjoy the egg , cheese , tomato , and union which you can substitute the flour tortilla for wheat .
mexican	nothing quite hits the spot like these bad boys . i also recommend the french toast bagel . great place to sit on the patio and enjoy a book on a lazy sunday .
mexican	crispy bacon ! i live 10 miles away and go here at leat once a week for the rolando 's burrito .
mexican	chorizo is the winner here . totally authentic like i used to enjoy in san diego .
mexican	very consistent and great food , hot sauce and quick service . highly recommend .
mexican	i 've tried all of the -bertos and eribertos is by far my favorite . sometimes there can be a bit of a wait , but it is well worth it . tortillas and red sauce were crafted by the hands of angels . great ratio of bacon / egg / cheese . if you 're looking for a great breakfast burrito , your search ends here . you 're welcome .
mexican	i could eat these all day . you get what you pay for as they 're stuffed full of delicious ingredients .
mexican	the only other place i ever go is texanos , but in the breakfast burrito category , i think favs has them beat . everything is well priced and tastes great . they even have a pool table and some video games now ! def check out their nachos too ! they are not to pass up !
mexican	i 'm craving one right now ! mmmmm open 24 hours
mexican	go for the supreme with green salsa , perfection .
mexican	i am so glad i live about 5m from this spot . the guacamole salsa is to die for .
mexican	i love the salsa bar green salsa as well as the spicy carrotts and peppers , fresh cut cucumbers ... i love this place and its right down the street from me i could walk there : )
mexican	the salsa is soooo good they jar and sell it ( i buy it every time to bring home ) . the word is getting out though ( darn it ! ) last visit they were out but john still sold us some in a carry container . john the owner has a presence here . you just get the vibe he cares about his customers , his business and the details . it shows !
mexican	such good food , their lengua taco 's are the bomb !
mexican	the breakfast burritos hit the spot after a long night shift or in the morning ! the establishment is a bit worn but the food is still good . the best part is they are open 24hrs .
mexican	we also come for taco monday they have tacos for $ 1 !
mexican	the churro waffle and the blueberry french toast are to die for . this place just opened up so the staff is still getting used to the place , but they still were awesome and made breakfast very enjoyable ! the place is nice on the inside too .
mexican	$ 5.95 same breakfast as $ 26 in ceasars . we also had lunch appetizers . homemade guacamole , generous portion very tasty but the queso poblano stole the show . generous portion of creamy queso served with fresh chips and salsa . more than we could eat . drinks are also very cheap . margaritas for $ 5 . all three time we visited , the servers were very pleasant and all orders brought out quickly . great outdoor patio for people watching . just off las vegas blvd and in forum shops . check it out and you 'll have extra money to party .
mexican	no kidding . best service , great coffee , atmosphere , and gourmet food delivered in sit down place within minutes of my order . had heuvos rancheros with machaca . fantastic food and they are doing it right .
mexican	on weekends , come early or you 'll be waiting for a long time . amazing and unique dishes - where else can you get cheddar and spinach waffles or brie avocado and bacon eggs benny ? ? ?
mexican	carne adovada is amazing , i could live off of the green chili potato , the rellenos are still my favorite .. big , fat and strong mimosas ( you know how a mimosa should be ) . you can 't go wrong with anything on the menu . i recently tried the posole and bought another bowl to take home . it 's just that good !
mexican	i haven 't really had any other menu items , but the burritos are fantastic .
mexican	i 'm addicted and i go once a week at least . not good for the waistline , but tastes so good !
mexican	the buns are amazing and soft . if you get chips the x-large is huge .
mexican	the variety of sauces and salsas is great , all tasted amazing . customer service was friendly and fast . will comeback for sure .
mexican	would highly recommend . plus we were met at the door by the kindest and happiest young man , jose . great experience .
mexican	came here with a group of 3 . one a picky eater , one gluten free , and me ( i 'll eat anything ) . we did the boozy brunch deal ( like $ 45ish ) which includes bottomless tapas and mimosas . there were 8 different flavors of mimosas , so we didn 't feel limited and enjoyed trying all of the waitress 's suggestions . my favorite was the raspberry , but the ginger blackberry was also a big hit . the food was divine . everything was unique and had great flavor . we never felt rushed and enjoyed sitting on the deck watching over the pool .
mexican	we got the $ 35 brunch with unlimited small plates and it was one of the best brunches i 've ever had . awesome awesome food and have the waitress surprise you with which types of mimosas you get , the $ 10 bottomless deal is great . 100 % will go out of my way to come back here every vegas trip it was amazing .
mexican	omelets are absolutely fantastic , as are the breakfast burritos and bloody mary 's !
mexican	get a reservation , though ! they also have great wine specials and the tapas is worth the price . radio is definitely one of my favorite regular places .
mexican	for about $ 35 per person , you can experience about 25 different small plates all of them prepared to order . my personal favorites are the french toast ( with berries , tres leches syrup and whipped cream ) , the oyster taco , the sweet corn tamale and the shrimp and grits . i 've tried almost everything and trust me , all dishes are great , i just have my favorites . service is excellent and best , no wait time on sundays .
mexican	the all you can eat small plate brunch was amazing .. each item ! and the bottomless mimosas are amazing . 8 different mimosa flavors that are bottomless and the champagne they use is great quality . but our waitress gatsby is the best we have ever had ! no joke . super attentive , never had an empty glass and just understood us . she even brought us a plate she thought we would like . told us to stay as long as we like . needless to say we sat and drank for 4 hours .. super happy
mexican	everything is great here and the food quality is a rated ! love the mexican food and meat station . take your time so you 're able to try everything . anytime we are in vegas this place is a must ! !
mexican	all of my neighbors have been talking about it non-stop . i went down and had a double cheeseburger with bacon , fat fries , and a vanilla shake . wow everything was so good ! ! the food is fresh , made to order and it is fantastic ! not to mention everyone there is warm and friendly . run don 't walk , get down to fatboy ! !
mexican	thought mango chutney sounded weird but try it ! nachos were ok , but rather pricey for just ok . both the ladies i went with really liked the margaritas . i don 't drink , but i thought i would add that .
mexican	the taste really fresh ! the lemonade is soooo good ! the best fries i have ever had ! love the stand !
mexican	i would say in and out and 5 guys and fries perfectly blended together = the stand . must try !
mexican	yes i said it : ) the ingredients are fresh and the prices are right .
mexican	even the garden burger is amazing ! the condiments are always fresh especially the tomato 's . reasonably price , just be aware this is a cash only business ! parking can be a pain some times but that 's any where on or around campus ! the employees are very straight forward , if you 're cool with them they will be cool with you ! be ready to order , they 'll ask you what you want while your standing in line . i recommend adding green chilly to any of the burgers ! don 't forget to order fries , they are not included .. the chuck box is number juan ! !
mexican	beats in n out by far . wait was less than 10 min not sure what people seem to be fussing about . you have to get the fries with the stand sauce . fries are so good and are seasoned with garlic salt ! can 't go wrong with anything on their menu
mexican	went at 10 : 30 in the morning and still a short line in drive thru . get the double . cheese if you like . great value for lunch or casual dinner .
mexican	i had to limit myself to 1 a week. delicious fries & the shakes are perfection. never had the tacos bc i can 't deny myself a burger from there , ever !
mexican	the fare is effectively a riff on fatburger , but they 've done a much better job and introduced a mexican food twist to the cuisine if you desire . not only can you get one of the best and most affordable burgers in vegas , but you can get a take out pizza for $ 6 . unheard of .
mexican	hands down ! ! ! super friendly staff and food to die for ! ! !
mexican	i have celiac disease , so i always get the gluten free bun and their fries are gluten free as well . accommodating of allergies as long as you communicate to them . the stand sauce is so good , blows the in n out special sauce out of the water . great service too , a lot of younger employees but we always get exceptional customer service . it is a great but dangerous thing that this place is around the corner from my house .
mexican	definitely try out the " great big one " or the " tijuana torpedo " ( a little messy , but definitely worth it ! ) .
mexican	best burgers , fish tacos to die for ... service is excellent .. these people actually care about good food and good service .. everyone go try this place !
mexican	double , double with cheese - animal style ! ! can 't go wrong here ! !
mexican	if you can come back to a place so many times you can barely count , that just says it 's really good and satisfying . i love their steak quesidilla in whole wheat with all the works and two lines of their house made hot sauce . steak burito is also another favourite of mine and is a staple when i feel like not cooking some dinner and just fancy a take out . the staff is friendly and they always make sure counter tops are always clean and replenished with their fresh and colourful ingredients . make sure to order ahead for pick up as the place is port credit gets quite busy with line ups .
mexican	i must have tried all the items in their menu and i keep coming back to my favourite steak quesadilla . very minimal menu but portion is enough to keep you satisfied . they also have a naked burrito if you want to skip the tortilla wrap . the place is tiny and can seat 5-6 on the ledge table . make sure to call for pick up ahead of time during peak lunch and dinner hours as the que gets long . they always keep the counters clean and replenished . ask for the house made hot sauce . one dot - mild 2 dots - medium one line - spicy * personally i go for 3 lines ! . fuego !
mexican	it 's not even close ! carne asada burrito is seasoned to perfection and so very fresh . my mind is blown every time i come here . if you 're from out of town or a local looking for a new favorite truck , this is the place .
mexican	it has been this way for over 30 years ! ! ! ! i have referred so many friends here . they are skeptical at first , but once the food arrives they are already talking about coming back . order in advance by phone and you can pick it up . or you can stand in line and place your order . everyone in kent is very familiar with this terrific spot . the burrito here is better than any mexican restaurant in the area .
mexican	lots of space to eat indoor and outdoor . i 've been to a few bb and i do enjoy the halibut and haddock . that 's about all i order from there . this location is on par with all the others . what they have going for them is the space and they were fully staffed even during a rush everyone was served in a timely manner . the con is parking . even on my motorcycle it was tight .
mexican	i always order the large chicken naked burrito and they always overfill it like crazy which is great ! they give you your moneys worth ! so much better than the streetsville location . they staff is super friendly and fast . the food always tastes fresh and you never get that gross bottom of the pot burned rice which yo get at some the burrito joints . i 've been to this location three times now and i 'm be back if i 'm in the area and craving a burrito.its a great addition to this busy complex which has a lot of other good food places .
mexican	they always cook the burritos perfectly here , compared to some of the other places where the grill is too hot and it cooks the outside quickly but leaves the inside cold . it 's also a super cheap meal !
mexican	especially the burrito bowl . simply delicious . i do not see how people complain about the service because i always get good service . i guarantee you will not get a better burrito anywhere in quebec . these guys do what they do , and they do it well .
mexican	i 'm not a spanish speaker , but had no trouble ordering lunch . we had one chicken and one shredded beef . both were great and served piping hot . the burritos are huge , plenty to split .
mexican	me and my team get burritos almost every week , they 're in homemade tortilla and taste amazing !
mexican	the green chili pork is crazy good ! ! ! my pick a couple of times a week .
mexican	i like this particular spot because it near my school . i have to say that the girl that wrap my burrito was exceptionally hot . i 'll go soon that ask her if she wants to put a wrap on my extra big burrito .
mexican	the older woman inside was a little disgruntled but i probably would be too if i were in that hot box
mexican	i had the steak burrito and it is well priced ! we will be back for sure . the staff was also helpful and gave great service . definitely , recommending to friends .
mexican	all of the people that work here are awesome people , and david is the homie ! great place to eat if you are in the area .. recommend 100 %
mexican	one of my new favorite pit stops before or after a club
mexican	their handmade margaritas are also spectacular ! the salsa bar gives you the opportunity to try all of their options . we have already been here 3 times and it will remain in our dining out rotation !
mexican	good food good prices . quick friendly service . i will be back .
mexican	very busy restaurant . quick and friendly servers but a slow process . but it was worth the wait . yum
mexican	can 't wait to try more of their menu . carne asada was perfectly cooked and the burrito had all of my favorite ingredients . i 'm definitely an onion and cilantro only kinda gal , which is what came standard in the burrito . yummmm !
mexican	easily outclasses qdoba or chiptole . haberno salsa is perfect blend of heat & flavor . chic-let gum with every order . favorite lunch spot uptown charlotte .
mexican	usually order a pork burrito mojado with mole . real flavors . attentive and thorough service . mexican coke . word ...
mexican	we 've tried them all , hands down , this is your spot . the variety of wraps and the homemade chips are fantastic . super fresh , huge portions , we got loaded steak burritos for ten bucks a pop . bring an appetite ! !
mexican	the green chili is the best i 've ever had , always a pleasure going to eat at rito 's surprise .
mexican	if you are wondering what to order , it is all great . i love the torta and fries , the california burrito , the carne asada fries ! if you are near campus and want to get some good mexican food for cheap , el paisano is the place . this place is way better than filiberto 's
mexican	food is fresh and delicious . prices are super affordable , my wallet says i can eat here everyday but my waist line says i need to limit myself to once in a while . portions are huge , i have a pretty big appetite and i only order a small . the one downside , and it 's only because of how popular the place has gotten , if you go right at noon it can take a bit to get your food but the food always comes to you hot and fresh . the staff are friendly and always make sure every burrito is made perfectly . i also just got their punch card .... your 9th burrito is free .... this could be dangerous .
mexican	buffalo chicken burrito , extra guacamole . my favorite burrito in toronto . the location is a little odd and hidden away , that doesn 't matter , the burritos are huge and delicious . the steak burrito was good but the buffalo chicken is amazing . highly recommended . definitely good value for the money , their " large " burrito is massive , the equivalent of a extra large at mucho , quesada , big fat burrito , etc .
mexican	great staff , friendly and accommodating . perfect participant among the thriving establishments of southend .
mexican	good quality mexican is harder to find in toronto than you think and this burrito delivers . i always get either a small halibut or shrimp with all the spicy fixin 's . everything is consistently fresh and delicious .
mexican	however , best to avoid popular times such as lunch ( during the week ) or after the clubs on friday / saturday . make sure to add the guac , well worth it !
mexican	i had a large chorizo and chicken burrito and was completely satisfied . perfect mix of spiciness , heartiness and awesomeness . there was a great selection of mexican soft drinks too . definitely worth going back .
mexican	i love the steak burrito with noodles and spicy . the jerk chicken burrito is a regular special and also amazing when available .
mexican	show up for happy hour after 11 , it 's half priced food and half priced stellar margaritas .
mexican	granted i only have ever tried the veggie . but it effing good !
mexican	blows chipotle out of the water . great price . get the jumbo burrito if you are man enough .
mexican	especially the pastor burrito . great beans and chips for free .
mexican	in fact my picky eating kids ask for it consistently . chill atmosphere and easy to find . i can only hope an eastside expansion is in the works . keep up the great food offerings muah ! !
mexican	friendly service too ! love the pulled pork burrito .
mexican	it 's hard to pass up a restaurant my grandpa grew up eating in , in the neighborhood he grew up in in the 40s .
mexican	i 'm not kidding . the shredded beef burrito had the most tender , lean beef . perfect ! the tortillas are homemade and delicious ! ! ! excellent balance of flavors . mango margarita was excellent too . we will be back again and again and again ! !
mexican	nice to know the meat is hormone free . food tastes great , friendly knowledgable service , clean . they even have a salsa bar .
mexican	the burrito was amazing and the steak was tender and very flavorful . the chicken chimi was decent but i preferred the steak by a landslide . the inside is mixed matched table & chairs and is like eating outside . don 't let this bother you b / c the food is worth it .
mexican	at least two of the salsas are worth the price of admission alone and the horchata is world class with fresh fruit .
mexican	seriously this place reminded me of the ones in mexico ... i 'd highly recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic taste ..
mexican	haven 't had one with sour cream but it was amazing !
mexican	literally ate that thing in under 5 minutes ... food was great , service was excellent , everyone was so friendly and the place was very clean ...... definitely coming back soon
mexican	wide selection of salsa and sauces , neat , clean and friendly also very reasonably priced as well . definitely returning !
mexican	so fresh , so good . friendly staff . nice inside decor , simple . delicious and can 't wait to go back . i think the owner is the one who took our order , very nice . the meat was very good and tender / juicy .
mexican	i went in and had the carne asada burrito . cooked & flavored right , tasted wonderful and was it bigger than a small dog . red and green salsa is awesome ! this place smokes roberto 's ! i 'll be going here from now on .
mexican	the ladies that work there are super helpful and friendly . lots of choices of burritos or tacos . i had a california burrito . the burrito was massive , so a really good value . the fries they put in the burrito didn 't have any flavor so it wasn 't my favorite . i would definitely go back though and try something different .
mexican	burritos are enormous and made with the freshest ingredients . i love the burritos , but lately i 've been ordering the steak quesadilla which is equally delicious . expect lines around the peak times like lunch time during the week and dinner times and late night after the bars get out .
mexican	love the different daily specials ! one time they had a blt burrito with a ton of other stuff in it . i got that and it was the best burrito i 've ever had ! love coming here ! if you 're in the mood for an amazing burrito this is the place ! !
mexican	great nachos . awesome tacos . one of my favorite places to eat .
mexican	since we found this place about 3 weeks ago , my husband has gone probably 6 times . great fast service . always a line out door but goes quick .
mexican	green chile pork is great ! the one dollar churros and the horchata are also favs .
mexican	the staff is super friendly and knowledgeable . get your burrito ( all the meat choices are delish ! ) and put whatever you want in it from the condiment bar then give it back to them and they roll it for you . yum !
mexican	they are friendly , fast and their tortillas are made in house which is the best part in my opinion !
mexican	best burrito place in the west end ... i have been here several time and was never disappointed with the quality of food. some of the employees tend to have a bit of an attitude , but that won 't stop me from going back
mexican	service is also really great too . highly recommend this location .
mexican	the decor is upbeat and good for the eyes . staff is always friendly . for the price it can 't be beat . a +
mexican	food is always done right ! the hot sauce is to die for if you are looking for a fiery kick . my all time favorite hot sauce , i 'm hooked ! the fish burrito is juicy and delicious ! the supreme fries are a must try ! the secret sauce makes it so amazing and makes you want more ! it 's a small place by finch station . the owner is a super cool guy , very energetic , passionate and remembers all his customers . check it out and you will be coming back for more !
mexican	my husband and i go there frequently . it 's the only place that makes their burritos spicy enough . plus i think it 's much better then burrito boyz .
mexican	best burrito places , its a unda spot u don 't really know its there .. but its sooo good ! ! ! !
mexican	simply put it : this is a true mexican food experience u must try . i ordered veggie quesadilla and my buddy ordered baja chipotle chicken burrito and it was both awesome and delicious . 10x vetter than chipotle & any other mexican restaurant in town .
mexican	the restaurant itself isn 't great but the good is exceptional . i usually get it to go . i especially love the breakfast burritos .
mexican	best green sauce ever , chicken is good quality , not old or shredded . wait time for food is a little longer , but worth it . best place ever ! i was devastated when you were closed for a short time .
mexican	my gf and i love coming here , and getting some good local street tacos .
mexican	easily beats any of the * * * aburtos any day every day . breakfast is delicious and the twin burrito is so good we drive from afar to come and get it . you must try .
mexican	excellent service as well . i always get the naked lil sweet potato burrito . it 's a great portion size , fresh ingredients , and delicious ! their music was a little too loud last time i was there , but it was a nice day so we sat on the picnic table out front . i am becoming a regular at this spot !
mexican	employees are so lay back , quick with orders ! small restaurant to dine in. great to bring the family .
mexican	i absolutely love the burritos and the people who work here ! i travel to this specific location at least once a week . ( i live downtown toronto , to give some perspective ) there is always a consistency with the taste and the atmosphere . the employees are friendly , fast and never judge you on how much cheese , noodles or whatever you decide to place on your burrito order . the choices for toppings , and overall menu are very wide and give you tons of options . i 've tried every burrito ! my top picks are : butter chicken and steak if you haven 't already try fat bastards burritos go big or go home
mexican	super fresh , authentic mexican cuisine right at richmond and spadina . it gets super busy around lunch but they 've managed an efficient production line to keep up with the lunch rush . the naked burrito is pretty amazing and comes with the standard : rice , refried beans , meat , lettuce , tomatoes , corn , pickled relish , jalapenos and guacamole at no extra charge ! i would recommend the regular chicken and the chicken tinga . i 'm sure i 'll be back to try out the tacos and beef !
mexican	and the nachos and tacos are fantastic as well : )
mexican	better than chipotle and moes . fresh ingredients and good flavors . ubereats also delivers which is an added bonus .
mexican	burritos . ever . i used to think chipotle was the bomb , then i tried this flavourful wrapped piece of heaven , and i saw the light ! guac is not extra , and they toast your burrito ; two things that i can 't say for chipotle !
mexican	burritos . ever . i waited so long to try this place , quickly dismissing it due to the outside exterior . don 't be a fool like me ! go in and find joy , topped with their excellent salsa .
mexican	the meat is fresh and well seasoned and the tortillas are fresh and soft . the service is nice and friendly and they make your food when you order . the mexican wedding cookies they sell there are delicious .
mexican	the way they make their tortillas fresh is incomparable . the queso can be a little thick , but it 's still great . better than chipotle by far .
mexican	very clean . brenda who was taking orders was very polite . love me some bacon breakfast burritos : )
mexican	best burritos hands down and their green sauce us what definitely makes this place a home run .
mexican	amazing breakfast burritos and an awesome shrimp burrito . i have yet to have something bad here ever .
mexican	the machaca is amazing along with the green chili burrito . great salsa and wonderful service . it can get packed at times .
mexican	do yourself a favor and skip the chain places and enjoy this local treasure. great food , fast service , friendly staff. owner is always there making sure things are running smoothly. i don 't think i 've ever heard any music playing here. which is totally ok .
mexican	by far my favorite burrito place in charlotte . don 't let the long line deceive you - it moves fast and is totally worth the wait !
mexican	get the red ( smoky fresh chipotle ) sauce they give on the side instead of the mild green ! then wash it down with a jarritos lots of food for the price , feeds two . they give so much more then other trucks . they are parked off archdale close to 77 in front of a hotel during the day .. and at night they are at where the yelp map shows them to be . cash only , please tip , and don 't try to speak to much english or spanish .. there very friendly but they like to get back to cookin your yummy grub. been patroning them for over 5 years
mexican	must try the california wet burrito , ground beef , queso , and french fries . very nice staff , clean restaurant , and consistently fresh ingredients . also must try the orange salsa , easily my favorite . thursday special of $ 5.49 for every burrito on the menu , all day . great chips as well . makes me never want to go to moe 's ever again .
mexican	i 've had the chic-in-sanity and the cubano . both were amazing !
mexican	everything is fresh and amazing . and the diversity of choices is mind blowing ! 3 choices of rice , 3 beans , 9 types of meat , 7 kinds of peppers / onions / mushrooms , and i can 't even count the amount of salsas right now . plus a huge choice of drinks . also you can order from la fiesta next door if you want . the staff is superb . best of all your supporting a local business that 's been around since the 50 's
mexican	it takes a little while to get your order but it is well worth it . also they have good salsa and guacamole dips . the cakes are also good and cheap too . the produce is cheap also .
mexican	best burritos in las vegas other places way too greasy.love the taste nice and quick .
mexican	hands down . think chipotle or qdoba ... only privately owned and better quality . the set up is a bit like a chipotle or burrachos ; and the choices are endless . you choose your base ( ei : burrito , quesadilla , tacos ) and then all of your ingredients . i 'm a burrito type ; with rice ; lettuce ; guac ; pico de gallo and salsa verde . the burritos are massive . it 's a quick place to get lunch and i am never disappointed .
mexican	you gotta try surf & turf burrito for only 6.99 . cheap but the portion and the quality is the top . i hardly finish my burrito by my own . they have drive thru btw .
mexican	if you happen to come on a day that they are making tacos too you have to try them !
mexican	i 've tried their ground beef , crispy chicken , and chickpea burritos . all three were great . my only suggestion is to stick with the small or regular cause the burritos really are big !
mexican	you can tell they cut their ingredients fresh , their meat is cooked nice and juicy and the burritos are grilled to perfection . a couple of things missing : corn and nachos .
mexican	i only get the halibut . i 've tried to order the chicken , but it always comes out " halibut " and i 'm never disappointed . get it with everything and spicy - it 's not too bad , don 't worry . protip : avoid the line and order ahead , especially if you 're having the fish or shrimp burrito
mexican	i used to work in the area and frequently grab a burrito there . i live and work far away from there now but will still make a special trip just to have one of their burritos . great prices too ! the staff are also very nice . i highly recommend the buffalo chicken burrito .
mexican	reasonable prices as well as a decent size selection , my personal favourite place to get burritos . call ahead to have burritos ready for pick up as there isn 't much space to stay there to eat .
mexican	i am here at least once a week . the service is always so great , the people working there are so nice , clean , professional . i usually get either the veggie or the shrimp burrito . the smallest size is perfect for my appetite . be warned , the hot sauce , is hot . i can handle spicy ... but this is a bit much ( still tasty though ) . they 're open late , theres ample parking up front . some spots to sit in on the inside , bar stool style . probably more comfy to eat at home while watching the walking dead .
mexican	plus the wrap the burritos do as to prevent spillage . the service is quick , polite , and coordinated . i wish the guacamole was more chunky but the selection of salsas makes up for it .
mexican	i loved the green chile pork and the breakfast burritos are to die for -. they 're very friendly and give great service .
mexican	i had a small steak burrito and it was enormous . pretty identical to the burritos you 'll get at big fat burrito or burrito boyz . if you have a student card , it 's $ 5 . really nice people working there , too !
mexican	i eat here almost once a week . enough said !
mexican	ingredients are always fresh and the flavour combinations are always delicious . i go at least once every two weeks !
mexican	full of yummy crunchy vegetables and not rice filler . i usually get the halibut . you can order off-menu and get it pan-fried rather than deep-fried . i like that it 's halibut and not garbage fish like tilapia , basa , goby , sculpin , or the other crap the other places use .
mexican	best burritos in toronto , probably , but that 's not saying too much. long waits around lunchtime. they change around the line system all the time which is very confusing , but it 's all totally worth it. not great quality , but try not to think about it and chances are you wont get sick. it 's the kind of place you crave at 2am on a cold saturday night-- and for that , they get my vote .
mexican	i like chipotle 's commitment to natural ingredients and meats raised without hormones or anti-biotics . it is worth paying a little more , cuz you definitely get what you paid for . since trying chipotle years ago , i can only eat burritos from one place : chipotle . no other burrito place comes close . on a side note , it disappoints me that with over 100 reviews , this quality restaurant has a score of 3.5 or so out of 5 . i guess i shouldn 't expect more from a world where " 2 and a half men " is a hit and people buy their produce at walmart . morons .
mexican	i won 't even go to chipotle , moes , or poncheros because cactus grill shuts them down .
mexican	gluten free halibut burrito ... yummy ! ! great service too ...
mexican	great for a quick lunch if you can catch them before or after a rush .
mexican	check out this hidden jewel and don 't let appearances deceive . this is some of the best food in the valley .
mexican	the burrito was packed ! ! ! very filling and their hot sauce is amazing ! ! ! soo peppery soo good ( but beware , very peppery sensation will occur )
mexican	great service and staff . try the fish taco .
mexican	i 've been twice now and i think i prefer the barbacoa to the carnitas , but both are fantastic , as are the homemade tortilla chips . the homemade guacamole is so good that i suspect it should be illegal . forget m4 and stop lamenting the lack of chipotle locations in montreal ; this place is in a completely different league .
mexican	these guys have been here a while , we were one of the their first customers back when they belonged to the greedy corporate " rberto 's . " they ventured off on their own after severing ties with them and now they have made a name for themselves . customer service is always good .
mexican	amazing portion sizes for the price . friendly local owners and staff . my favorites are chili verde and rcb ... so good !
mexican	the california surfin is amazing ... and they don 't skimp on the shrimp either . they use a good size shrimp not those baby shrimp . you definitely have to try out this place ! ! ! !
mexican	it 's my secret spot . food portions are huge and their burritos are delicious .
mexican	everything is really fresh . green salsa is off the hook .
mexican	i love this place and wish montreal had more of them !
mexican	tequila lime is the go to - and order a big one . huge is too much , little is still good but cmon man it 's a burrito what the hell are you doing ordering a little one . buffalo and baja chipotle also excellent . also , the hot sauce is insanely hot. don 't make the mistake of being a big man and putting lots on your first time . like my first prom , it will end in tears and lots of bread . burritos are love . burritos are life .
mexican	my coworkers and i come here at least 3 times a week !
mexican	had the green chili burro , enchilada style with green sauce and the bean burro enchilada style with red sauce . awesome . the family vibe was even better ! marissa , is very welcoming and kind . ! it will be my weekly stop ! i 'm serious ! the munoz family has proven how good they are by their success of rito 's in central phoenix . we are so lucky they have brought their good stuff to the west valley !
mexican	but then i am only reviewing one thing . burrito - barbacoa with everything . must have every time i go downtown .
mexican	fast friendly service 3.99 breakfast good and 99 cent bloody mary 's . we ate breakfast there 3 times . six people for under 40.00 can 't beat that !
mexican	i am here with three of my mexican friends and they also approve ! it is truly authentic !
mexican	the place would be dazzling with a patio and more seating , but even without i 'm sold on the food and definitely the drinks . i had the santisima special quesadilla , which should not be named something so bland and unremarkable as a quesadilla ; it was the demi-god of quesadillas , more of an empanada , the hercules of mexican food ; it could beat up your dad is what i 'm saying , unless your dad is really old then it would help him out of his chair and bring all the salsa options to the table to give his old bones some rest .
mexican	we love this place . ask for the extra hot salsa if you are in the mood .
mexican	love the coffee , love the busboy special , love the happy beans . it 's my favorite restaurant to take out of town guests . each month features a different theme for specials . great neighborhood restaurant and friendly staff .
mexican	phoenix doesn 't have the greatest selection of cajun offerings so i was amazed at food truck friday to find jamburrito . they have a pretty stellar selection of meats & meals considering it 's from a truck . the spices were perfect - just spicy enough to enjoy but nothing that 's going to harm . i had the catfish once and the jamburrito twice ... not in one sitting because the portions are very filling .
mexican	best calemary , , best location , best mexico food , oh my gosh i ordered pineapple and coconut juice it was so good every one should try it for one time , i am sure you will like it
mexican	seriously some fine mexican food , and it 's always friendly in here .
mexican	i used to go to burrito express , now i go to both lol . mostly here though . came here for the first time , only got a carne asada burrito , came back a few weeks later to try the california carne asada , amazing . also the carne asada fries , wayyyy better than filibertos or amados . once a week type place !
mexican	this is puerto rico outside puerto rico . keep up the quality and flavor.thank you
mexican	chicken is a fall off bone , well seasoned . yes the line up is long , but it is worth it . the parking lot is hard to park in ( small ) .
mexican	we have gone to several others in this area , none of which are as full of flavor . i don 't want that bland flavour , give me some punch in my chicken ! yay mammas ! keep on what you 're doing .
mexican	we went here using the drive thru with our doggies and they gave us some milkbones for them . don 't know the name of the person but thank you !
mexican	order always perfect , great customer service . delicious perfectly cooked food . only carl 's worth going to . : )
mexican	homemade tortillas , super nice owners . love this place . i typically go there 2-4 times a month and will go the extra few miles to eat at a local restaurant over similar chain restaurants .
mexican	they have a ton of spicy food selections that i love . if you are brave enough , try the habanero burger , it will light you up ! they also have a great patio with a pond , waterfall and bridge to an outside bar . cool place my family all get together for dinner
mexican	their grilled chicken tacos are very tasty as well . the chips and salsa are amazing as the chips are the perfectly sturdy for scooping up globs of salsa , yet not hard as glass to keep from scraping the interior of your mouth . i can 't believe i haven 't heard about this place beforehand . definitely a must if you 're in the area . also , the steak burrito and veggie burrito were a hit amongst my group . the tortilla is freshly made and the size of the burrito should be enough to please even the hungriest of guest .
mexican	i prefer no cabbage and it 's amazing for only $ 5.50 ( accept cash only ) . i live far from this spot but drive out here weekly from ne mesa .
mexican	i 'm unsure why nobody talks about this place . authentic ! !
mexican	best carne asada burrito in town , meat is sooo tender , get there before the lunch rush to avoid the lines
mexican	plus the red hot sauce / salsa is amazing and addicting . if you eat here , be sure to order the fresh guacamole . when you are finished eating you can grab a drink from the bar and hang out by the pool or chill out on the roof deck above the hotel .
mexican	the pupusas are all made to order and are of excellent quality . the prices are reasonable as well . i took off one star for bad service i have received a few times when placing take out orders but the food itself makes up for it .
mexican	great food . clean restaurant . kind staff . a gem !
mexican	my wife is mexican , i know mexican . place is out of bounds .
mexican	ordered to go . was ready in minutes , got good salsa with it . decent prices . will be back to try again .
mexican	everything else i 've tried is bomb , too .
mexican	authentic and i love the salsa bar when you eat in . if you 're in the mood for mexican , this is the place !
mexican	best carne asada burritos in the state and i consider myself a mexican food expert ; ) ... any way try this place out , make sure you get a burritos the first time you go here , not a taco .
mexican	the ladies are nice . the place is not the fanciest but it 's always clean . the prices are fair .
mexican	best carne asada burritos we have had in phoenix so far , will definitely be back !
mexican	awesome beer battered fish tacos too . chipotle sauce and avocado sauce are out of this world . sonoran hotdogs wrapped in bacon have excellent flavor with a great bun . a definite must try !
mexican	decided to give this place a try after an older mexican co-worker told me they had good mexican food and he liked senor taco a lot . i wasn 't disappointed . the frijoles and tostadas lack flavor compared to some traditional places but the carne asada and pollo asado burritos are great . i haven 't been able to find a good burrito since my years living in westside phoenix , and this place reminds me of one of the very few things i miss from that part of town , great mexican food . if you think taco bell is great ( like my wife from michigan ) this place isn 't for you . i however , will be back soon .
mexican	tried other places and just love it here ! ! !
mexican	i live this place and i come here all the time with my family . i will keep coming here . thanks for the awesome service
mexican	the end just go and order them and thank me later .
mexican	the salsas are bomb and tase real . customer service is great i even got free chips to try the salsas the place is very clean . i will keep coming here for good . que filibertos ni que nada ! !
mexican	i just melted like the amazing cheese they had when i bit into them . my carne was perfectly cooked and tasty and i don 't think i could ask for a better plate . i 'll be back ritually , that is a gaurentee . and the half plate is only like 6.49 ! ! ! ! with everything on it ! yes , please !
mexican	my favorite spot was back in california but this place beats them for sure . they have great service too . if you come in you have to get the windy city fries ! !
mexican	i 've tasted filiberto 's and it can 't even hold a candle to vaquero 's carne asada fries . i didn 't know well-cooked fries topped with a humungous amount of meat , guacamole , sour cream , and cheese could be heaven on earth . one $ 7 take-out box could feed 4 people easily . i always make sure to bring a box home if i ever have guests and they usually end up loving it equally - or more so than me . i 've recently discovered this hole-in-the-wall and honestly , i 've been coming back at least twice a month since then . it 'll satisfy all your authentic mexican food cravings especially since they 're open 24 hrs !
mexican	staff is super friendly and food is always delicious !
mexican	we have to stop here every trip to vegas tons of meat and cheese and not pricey for the amount easily enough for two ppl with leftovers and they let u take beer inside
mexican	almost as good as what you get in san diego . the smaller of the two size options will easily feed 2 people . everything is made to order so you must be patient for your food . great customer service . anytime i 'm craving carne asada fries , this is where i 'll go to get them in vegas .
mexican	although the condiments are basic . they are really good .
mexican	shrimp tacos are awesome as well . staff is great .
mexican	best carne asada in the valley. don 't go here for anything else or it 'll just be okay .
mexican	these tacos taste just like the ones in rocky point . the line can get long , but the food is awesome and the prices are great !
mexican	steak quesadilla is amazing , carne asada burrito is amazing get it with everything on it , arroz y frijoles is not the same as rice and beans , also amazing . that crema .
mexican	best carne asada in town and lets don 't start talking about their handmade tortillas ... delicious ! ! ! !
mexican	been here several times since the whole breakout in august . so everybody calm down and do some research . i read online they got the local queen of clean as an independent consult , this place is spotless . i 've went into the restaurant and from the counter u can see everything in containers like at panda express . get the carne nachos or carne asade fries , you won 't regret it !
mexican	bro took us to lunch after the painstaking task of helping him move , ugh ! we loved it ! fresh simple food ! only criticism ..... use quiktrips bathroom , don 't use their . their tacos are way cheap , $ 1.10 / ea normally and i think on wednesdays they are like half priced . very goof fresh ingredients . excited to try the other location close to my house .
mexican	must try if you are on this side of town
mexican	salsa bar is always fresh and well stocked . restaurant is always clean and service is fast .
mexican	i love the tacos , vampiros , and their sauces . only downside is the price is a bit much compared to places around and for the area it 's in but it 's probably because of the quality of the food .
mexican	this is our go to place to get our supplies ! when i visits brother in law in mexico he makes me take him 30 lbs of it . lol
mexican	the burritos are massive . nice variety in the menu . definitely light years ahead of roberto 's and other mexican fast food places .
mexican	the meat has a great flavor and is very tender ! definitely my go-to place for carne asada !
mexican	i don 't know if they are putting too much seasoning on or what , but i 've come out of here gasping on some occasions . i do also agree with bryan s. that the employees are of a lower caliber than usual and the servings sizes are all wrong . i 've never come out of a chipotle hungry until i started visiting this location .
mexican	every time i am here they are out of something . last time , they were out of chicken , guac , and even burrito bowls--i got my meal in a salad bowl . this is pretty much the usual for this location . i 'm not sure how they manage to stay so perpetually under-supplied . and it doesn 't help that their service is super slow too , so even if there aren 't that many people , you will be waiting for a while . if there are a lot of people , you 'll probably get your meal quicker if you walked over to the oakland chipotle .
mexican	the last three times i visited food was not prepped ( at 11 : 30 ) . employees don 't seem to care at all . very slow , no sense of urgency even if the line is long . i have also had problems with online ordering being ready . i recommend going to the chipotle near university heights on cedar .
mexican	disappointed with the amount of food they give you . smallest portions ever . last time i go there
mexican	the one i just got here was the smallest chipotle burrito i have ever seen , and when i mentioned it 's sub-compact size to the cashier , she blew me off . the twinsburg chipotle is very clean , the staff is friendly and it 's conveniently located . but , if you 're hungry , i suggest you head to the one in hudson or northfield .
mexican	small portions , barely anything is included , 2.00 if you want guacamole on your burrito ( basically a tablespoon of guac ) . got burrito bowls with my husband tonight with a side of chips and guac ( 3.00 ) . left feeling hungry and spent 22.00 altogether . they gave us a ridiculously small amount of chips . i 'm going to say approximately 13 chips ( not kidding ) for two people for 3.00 ... lower your prices if you 're going to give that amount . super annoying . probably won 't come back for a long time . not worth the expensive prices .
mexican	this is the worst chipotle i 've ever been to . the online orders are never ready , they 're never accurate and they 're constantly running out of stuff . anytime i go here , the line can be 5-20 people and it always takes 20-25 minutes to get through the line . if you 've never experience chipotle before do not go here as you may never go back again . this place is a joke .
mexican	i have been here 4 times in the last month and every single time they forget a burrito , quesadilla or the chips i have ordered . it 's kind of a running joke in my house hold . the staff is kind but needs to learn to check the bag before handing it out . i know i will be checking my bag before i leave next time .
mexican	the portions are not suitable for the amount you pay . the cashier will help prepare food then go back to taking money and vice verse ( yuck ) ! i haven 't been back and probably won 't go back bcz of these issues .
mexican	this one is basically as good as a chipotle is expected . everyone in a while it is good and usually easy thing to grab while working . except for this particular chipotle . they always have too few employees working the line which causes a huge back up . i have come here many times as i work in the area and every time the line is ridiculous and there are employees standing around in the back . easy to spot as you are looking right in their direction while you wait in a 25 minute line . good quality food but horrible management .
mexican	the customer service sucks and the attitudes here are horrible . this is the closest location to my house , but i 'll gladly drive a few minutes further just to avoid all this in the future . do better , south blvd !
mexican	why 2 stars ? well the employees here were loud , screaming over the music , and seemed annoyed to be working . my portion was half what i 'm used to after eating chipotle for 8 years . the seating in this store is weird , too . most customers seemed to be getting their food and going to the nearby food court . awkward . i prefer the one in university city where employees smile and the food looks fresh .
mexican	first of all it is terrible for you , most people have no idea how many calories they are actually consuming . this location when i visited had the filthiest dining room . would it kill you to get one of your peeps to sweep the floor and clean off tables ? do i really have to sit in a chair covered in guacamole knee deep in broken corn chips ? the food is meh . there is nothing special about it . stop about 200 feet before chipotle and get yourself chik-fil-a to eat .
mexican	the quality of qdoba 's chicken is consistently horrible . chewy and fatty and quite gross .
mexican	they have now changed their corporate policy to only offer discounts to law enforcement . as a disabled veteran , i always appreciated the discount for veterans . it 's too bad that chipotle now does not recognize and value the military and veterans in the same way as they recognize our brethren in law enforcement .
mexican	the place was clean , staff were very polite , and the food mediocre at best . i enjoyed the speed at which the food was prepared , but the end result also tasted as if i just had a gas station burrito . this joint has a following of sorts , i 'm just not one of them . personally i can not recommend chipotle .
mexican	i felt it had no flavor . nice place , clean . but the food was blah . my steak was awful . it looked ilke pork and am still not convinced that it was steak. i regretted going there instead of jersey mike 's next door : ( sometimes you learn the hard way .
mexican	they crefuse to hire more people to move the line faster and the employees don 't care at all . they screw around and don 't care that the customers in line are all complaining . the manager was mixing the rice with his bare hands , no big deal , except for the fact that he had a bandage on . worst of all the end of chipotle will be their online ordering . the entire line should not have to wait for a bunch of online orders to come down the line unaware of how much needs to be made to determine if they are willing to wait .
mexican	chipotle 's a block away , do yourself a favor and skip this place .
mexican	chipotle style bowls , too bad they charge extra for extra salsa and food it 's kind of cold .
mexican	i do not recommend coming here , just hit up chipotle instead .
mexican	online order for a steak bowl double meat and i pick up my food and arrive at home to discover there is not a single piece of meat in my bowl but i was still charged for double steak and my chips where stale to top it off but this chipoltes chips seem to always be stale for some reason they are also always out of everything for some reason
mexican	i would put up with the slow , apathetic service if your food was worth it . now that i 'm out of gift cards , we won 't be back .
mexican	i had burrito with tofu and brown rice . the tofu is lack of flavor . the brow rice is under cooked which is very common for chipotle . the rice makes me feel i 'm eating paella , but the flavor makes me feel sick .
mexican	following their public overhaul , we stopped going while ' improvements ' were made . tonight after several months of waiting , we tried again . over grilled dry chicken in my salad , sent my dinner into the trash . the ceo of chipotle said publicly that their improvements were going to be above and beyond required regulations . grilling chicken is easy . maybe not for chipotle ?
mexican	please see yet another image - receipt of my order clearly shows corn salsa yet no salsa was added . : ( apparently yelp won 't let me added another image so you 'll just have to take my word for it - at this location , if you place an order online , you can bet they 'll make it wrong . go in , watch your meal made , that way you can make sure it 's right .
mexican	i come to your establishments regularly and this location something is not right . 1 . the cleanliness is downright gross . food scraps on the floor . tables not wiped down . chairs looking in dire need of replacement . 2 . no customary greeting ! i always rewarded with a smile but today which was not busy at all and two customers in front of me no one smiled . maybe it was just a bad day for the team members . 3 . cashier took forever . it 's like she deliberately let the line stack up until she took noticed .
mexican	you had friendly staffs and the food was so tasty ! now , only friendly staffs . i ordered two steak bowl , the steaks were chewy and tasted blant . are you lost ?
mexican	the enchiladas tomato sauce is like italian . very strange . good service but this is just a basic " mexican " food joint . i wouldn 't come back ...
mexican	cheap tequila in the margarita . green chile enchiladas were saucy and too tangy , without any real definition between ingredients . atmosphere open in a bad way--one big room with a bunch of tables . overall , dive quality food at scottsdale prices . will not return .
mexican	the chips are not one of my favorites as anyone else tonight . they have not other salsa . the street tacos , had a lot of goo flavor and the green salsa served with them is really good . they out to serve green withe chips . margaritas with chambor were good as usual . beer was very cold as we like it . oh and by way ... to the ne owners .... put the shrimp dumplings back on the menu . those were the best appetizer on the menu . i can only give you guys 2 stars . still love the atmosphere here . peace !
mexican	service was good . but i came for the tacos and they sucked . the hunt continues to find badass tacos in madison
mexican	the service was incredibly slow . three of us went out , and when we got in there were only 2 other tables that were full , and we didn 't leave until an hour and a half later . the food was super great , but was flavored differently than any other mexican food restaurant i 've been to . i guess if you don 't mind any if that then this place is worth a try . the pricing was affordable . we all at for 35 dollars .
mexican	runniest salsa i have ever had . soupy . my shrimp enchiladas were ok . this is a bar restaurant where the mexican food is barely average . service was good .
mexican	drinks .... fine i guess . food ... bland as can be . absolutely zero flavor or spice . enchiladas tasted like a budget gourmet frozen dinner . not many options on menu either in my opinion . skip this place !
mexican	dry meat on my tacos , my wife had a really bad salad . chicken coated with sauce that was more like italian sauce than anything mexican .
mexican	my boyfriend liked his enchiladas . however i ordered the seafood quesadilla and was disappointed to find it full of nothing but imitation crab . there were several shrimp and scallop options on the menu so i expected some of that in there but got nothing but bland fake crab . very misleading . the cheese was also barely melted , the tortilla was flabby and the dish itself was overpriced . it 's like they were up charging for seafood that wasn 't actually on the dish .
mexican	the chips come with a cup of salsa and a cup of bean dip . staff was friendly and quick . it was unbelievably warm inside though , which made everything really uncomfortable . food was served fast and was ok . be careful though , everything is an extra charge . sour cream is a dollar and a side of guacamole is $ 4 . sodas were $ 2.50 . parking is always a bit of a headache but there is an alley to the rear that has more parking available .
mexican	husband liked his chorizo potato tacos , but this place didn 't have great options for vegetarians . i had to ask if i could make my own vegetarian combo . i got a combo with a cheese quesadilla , bean enchilada , & chile rellano - didn 't enjoy it at all . the black beans on the side were good . needless to say , we won 't be back . there are other places in this area that cost the same and have better food . service was also underwhelming .
mexican	not a big deal , they make them fresh to order too . i had been looking forward to trying rositas for a long time based on the yelp reviews . my mom ordered the chicken enchiladas and i ordered the machaca chimi both came with rice and beans . my mom enjoyed the enchiladas , and i thought the chimi was okay ... nothing spectacular . about halfway through our meal , a baby cockroach crawled across the table . we both lost our appetite and asked for the check . i got my food to go , but just couldn 't bring myself to finish it . definitely disappointed ..
mexican	especially for $ 3 . $ 4 more dollars to add the guac ! i didn 't add the guac . i got 2 tacos . one carne asada and one shrimp . there were 3 shrimp that were on the taco butterflied to lool like 6 . it was ok tasting ... kinda burnt tasting . the carne asada taco would have been good but that too was burnt tasting . probably won 't eat here again . also note : no budwiser products for a mexican restaurant ! ! !
mexican	rest of food has no flavor . stay away from here if you like flavorful and spicy mexican food . haven 't had food this bad in a long while .
mexican	salsa is ok , just not as good as most restaurants . everything else i tried was sort-of gross
mexican	both salsas taste like they 're from a can , the green one tastes like sugar water . kids " quesadilla " is just cheese melted on top of a tortilla . maybe they were having an off day . locals seem to like it because it was packed . i hate posting bad reviews but hoping they see this and step up the quality . i 've never been served a basket of soggy chips , ever . my note to the owner , make your salsa fresh . it would make a world of difference . if you already do , try a different recipe , it 's as bad as a store bought can .
mexican	black beans were bland , and the cilantro rice had little flavor . skip this place .
mexican	it was my first time here with my husband and i was pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed the chips and salsa it gave me high hopes for the rest of the meal . we got our chili con queso and the cheese was grainy and way too thick . then i got my carintas tacos with rice and beans . the beans seriously lacked salt and the rice tasted old and crispy . the tacos were the worst of all . the meat was harder than beef jerk and soggy in the rest of it . i am sadly disappointed and will not be returning .
mexican	chips , salsa , cheese were good , taco was greasy and tasted like taco bell , enchilada was nothing to write home about , tostada was mushy from all the grease , cheese quesadilla wasn 't bad but nothing i would get again , server seemed very angry , and just threw everything on table , not a good experience all around
mexican	margarita on the rocks was ok , spinach dip was ok . chese enchilada & chile relleno was ok . husband had a chicken chimi , he did not like it but like the beans and rice . my friend from canada like the beef enchilada & hard shredded beef taco . flan was tough .
mexican	green rice and beans with the combo plates flavorless and bland . pulled pork tacos terrible tasting . will never return to this overpriced , under flavored , faux tex-mex restaurant .
mexican	chips started off great , carne assada tacos were a major let down , but the chili verde burrito made up for some of the lackluster taco failure .
mexican	and the chicken enchiladas weren 't very good . service was good . so many good mexican restaurants around here and this place is not among them .
mexican	shrimp cocktail was terrible . cilantro rice pretty good .
mexican	after being told that this was the place for " authentic tacos " i wanted to try it and finally did yesterday . definitely not coming back due to poor service and mediocre at best tacos . maybe they are good after 5 or 6 margaritas ...
mexican	tomatillo and avacado salsa was nearly straight tomatillos , it really needed something to tame the tomatillos . the carnitas burrito was ok but was just a little off on flavor making it soso . the mexican corn bread was absolutely awful . i had two bites , i only had the second because i didn 't believe it was as bad as first thought but i was wrong , it was that bad . nothing here to make me go back and plenty to keep me away .
mexican	salsa was okay ! our waiter dominique was very nice and helpful . me and my girlfriend ordered tacos steak was okay , pastor was like chicken but okay . now the shrimp tacos were the best ! fish taco was alright ! then we had this couple that couldn 't stop staring it was annoying ! ! ! thanks hard rock for the coupon ! overall it was okay .
mexican	for $ 2.50 / taco ( on taco tuesday & $ 3.50 / taco every other day ) you get soggy , greasy , drippy , tiny street tacos ! i couldn 't even eat it without the entire insides falling out all over the place . so , essentially i paid $ 2.50 for 2 pieces of over grilled , under seasoned shrimp ... don 't understand why people rave about this place . the staff was really friendly and attentive , that 's about the only good thing i have to say .
mexican	salsas were just spicy ( red and green ) and not very good . ordered the cheese enchilada meal . rice was old tasting , hard yet sticky . enchilada was strange and was flat dough . 3 because it was just okay . i didn 't puke .... but i may when i think about it . probably the worst restaurant i 've ever been to . and it 's expensive . how ? there are so many better places nearby . i 'm no longer allowed to choose where to eat . do not eat here !
mexican	salsa was mediocre . the beans had a weird aftertaste in the lettuce smelled strange . poor quality food .
mexican	inedible . typical for this location . last month i got a burrito with hard uncooked corn .
mexican	for the most part they have a similar ethos : big , wholesome portions alongside average flavours . i found the nachos here to be well in the ' overkill ' category . immense portions and way too much sour cream justify this , nonetheless my chums whom had not ordered a starter where pleased to help me out . like the starter , the mains exhibit the same qualities leading to a pretty average meal , nothing special . there ' more personal and tastier mexican restaurants in edinburgh than chiquito , not my favourite .
mexican	jalapeno poppers ( 7 ) had a bitter taste . near my home and i cave and eat here every 4-5 years and am always disappointed . $ 7.54 which someone would open a decent fast food on this corner .
mexican	chocolate terra cotta warrior is literally the most expensive dessert i have ever seen .
mexican	i should have read more carefully . i had vicki 's plate . the chicken was really dry , sauce was so hot , i couldn 't taste the food and guacamole so bland . skip this one and keep driving .
mexican	the service is horrible , the prices aren 't great and the food is not good . my boyfriend got a chicken burrito and i got a veggie burrito .. we weren 't expecting too much because we had read the yelp reviews before going in there .. but they didn 't taste nice at all and my veggie burrito had a piece of meat in it . thats all ... id recommend walking 5 minutes down the road to el taco feliz !
mexican	i stopped by the churches on nellis blvd for what i thought would be a quick bite to eat , mind you there was no one else in the drive-thru . i only requested a 2 piece mixed & 2 hot peppers . the employee could not get that right . he repeated the order incorrectly at least 5 times . i get to the window and had to waited more than 6 minutes . i 'm thinking they were cooking chicken and it would be hot and fresh . wrong , the chicken was cold and stale . i gave it back and returned the chicken and requested a refund .
mexican	asked for a passion fruit marg they informed me that it was on the menu but they didn 't sell it . all in all wouldn 't return . food was average . nothing to call home about .
mexican	the quesadillas were alright . their chips are so greasy and deep fried it should be a sin . the salsa is alright . spicy and fresh . i ordered off uber eats on thanksgiving and my options were limited ! so what can you really expect !
mexican	" it 's literally the same restaurant with cheap salsa and really bad service ( and a 96 for a sanitation rating ) . the bartender makes a nice margarita .
mexican	when i lived in ca , i chuy 's was a regular haunt because the food has need awesome since the original days . but the service at this particular resturaunt is inexcusable . one person was given the wrong food . mistakes happen ... but the manager ( who made the mistake on the order ) refused to fix it , and actually insisted the person in our party that got the wrong food ordered it that way . her argument was that the customer ordered a dinner they hated and she was not going to fix it . great food , when they get the order right . but service is so bad , you will be best served going elsewhere .
mexican	this location , however , needs some help . food was so-so . didn 't taste at all like i was used to in other locations in va and fl . hopefully will improve as staff gets better training . gave them an extra star because they were newly opened but the only thing that was good were the chips and margaritas .
mexican	not a good restaurant for the south park area with its tacky decor . it 's like a mcdonalds playground with kids running everywhere including on top of the walls around the restaurant and fountain . you can find much better mexican food anywhere in this area . it 's cheap food and i guess that 's the draw . zink the former upscale restaurant at that location allowed dogs on the patio . this cheap , tacky restaurant doesn 't allow dogs .
mexican	the food doesn 't have any flavor what so ever . i was highly disappointed . i was looking forward to spanish restaurant near my house , however it was not to my liking . i will not be back here . i have had texmex before but i have never had it before with little to no flavor .
mexican	the food was just okay and didn 't seem fresh at all . the fish tacos were honestly the worst fish tacos i 've ever had . the appetizer sampler wasn 't bad but wasn 't any better than a south blvd mexican restaurant . chips and salsa were good . our server was very nice and tried really hard but i would be surprised if she had ever worked in a restaurant before . overall not a great experience .
mexican	which , is understandable if it 's a one-time thing that they don 't have enough people working . the problem is the portions seem small here . ( at least 3 visits so far . ) the quality has been ok , though i 'd tend to agree with another opinion on here about the rice not being up to usual standards ( compared to all the other chipotle 's ) . i am a big chipotle fan , but overall , this location near south hills village isn 't on par with the others .
mexican	never a good sign when your server doesn 't know the tequila menu in a mexican food restaurant . highly doubt i 'd ever come back here ...
mexican	authentic mexican this is not , tex-mex maybe . the food was greasy and tatseless even the drinks were bad . if you can pick any place other than this do yourself and do so .
mexican	i love cheese , but not like this . they do not make their own salsas , they are canned sauces on their enchiladas for sure . the menudo looked good , very small portion . everything else is bland , huge portions , crazy amounts of canned salsa and cheese .
mexican	tortillas are good but that 's where the praise ends . i had a burrito and i swear i could make a better one myself with a can of chicken and enchilada sauce . throw in microwave . served ! next time i 'll save the 6 bucks .
mexican	bad chips , chicken cheese crisp was mostly salt , guacamole tasteless , and did i mention too much salt . service however was great !
mexican	really wish i could post a photo of the poor disgrace .
mexican	slow and uncoordinated staff . dry and sub-par pizza - that made us feel sick biggest issue : should train staff to change gloves when someone mentions they are vegetarian / gluten-free / etc . we asked the employee to change gloves then another employee is questioning his coworker why she changed gloves and for who ....
mexican	the containers that held the food wasn 't covered . so the variety of meat , beans and other toppings looked as if it hasn 't been refilled , reheated , or at least stirred before we reached the counters . i ordered three grilled chicken tacos and the tortillas were cold . only had a nibble of chicken on the tacos so it would pretty much be a veggie taco lol . staff was ok , restaurant was very cool but i 've definitely experienced better .
mexican	the meats are only ok , the sauce is tasteless and they use way too much . cornbread was microwaved and gummy . we won 't be coming back .
mexican	cleaning and handling money then preparing food , without washing hands a big no no ....
mexican	i was disappointed with the tacos for a few reasons : 1. too many toppings , and one had a brown mustard taste that ruined it for me ; also too much cabbage but that at least could easily be taken off . 2. o.k. fish 3. expensive i will not go back - $ 11 for 2 tacos and no sides . save your $ $ for somewhere else . all a fish taco needs is good fish , a good white based sauce , a little cabbage and red sauce on the side . fish and chips were better but not great .
mexican	she works for minimum wage for a reason , i suppose . the soda machine is not working and they only have expensive bottled sodas available . she couldn 't even offer me an ice water . it 's june , and it 's going to be 109 ° today , i 'm traveling with my six-year-old and four-year-old and have a lot of business to get done . i 'm glad i changed my mind about eating here . i don 't spend my hard-earned money at places like this and these are the types of people that make it difficult to defend scottsdale in general . i 'll head back to gilbert where people are nice to each other .
mexican	i 'm surprised that mexican food can be so bland ! i had the crunchy carne asada tacos . the meat was chewy and bland with more lettuce than flavor . my husband had a carne asada burrito which didn 't have any rice or beans in them - just meat , guac and salsa . so disappointing ! we won 't be back as there is amazing mexican food out there . this just wasn 't one of those places . the empty restaurant should have been an indicator .
mexican	i tried the bandeja paisa , and some empanadas . wont be coming back : (
mexican	i ordered the lengua , carnitas , adobada tacos and tortilla chips with guac . the cook the meat on the stove top so you get a nice sear / crisp to the meat . i didn 't really like the guac , it 's blended so it 's very much like a puree . the tortilla chips and guac weren 't that great . chips seem to be made in house as it retains a lot of grease . the guac didn 't have texture so it didn 't taste great together . i think guac puree should be used in different dishes , not tacos and chips . staff was nice . i probably would not return .
mexican	just close if you 're going to make me wait in your long ass drive tru line . for absolutely no food .
mexican	clean the outside of your restaurant. i was disgusted to see the dumpster area when ordering my food. the smell was nauseating and garbage was all over also clean the wall leading up to the drive thru window. there is spit and tobacco dryed to the wall. lastly power-wash the entrance to your restaurant the cement leading in is flighty and is not welcoming to customers where is the pride of ownership and how the heck is management missing all of this ? ? ? i really hope the kitchen is clean. i can 't believe i even have to write this post. this is the truth no joke ... very concerning ! ! ! ! !
mexican	bag of chips taste like they were from the day before . i do not suggest this place to go .
mexican	super inconvenient for it to say one thing yet do another .
mexican	i was constantly referred to as " gringo guy . " they got what they wanted ; i 'll never go back . i wish there was a minus zero star for the rating . racists ! all i wanted was food .
mexican	so over priced for the food tasting like canned refried beans . the chicken had no flavor . the beans were old and dry . vegas has a lot of shitty mexican food but this definitely takes the trophy . highly disappointed as we have waiting and wanted to try this place but it was always so expensive .
mexican	they are constantly out of chicken and seem to be upset with the customers that would rather wait for it . no customer service , they were even rude to a cop that wanted to wait patiently . i won 't be going back to this location , i 'd rather drive the extra few miles .
mexican	nice patio , ideal for passing the time waiting for a server to acknowledge your existence or for anything from the slow kitchen . ideal old town location , one block from the hospital . a fitting neighbor for the home of the worst tacos in town . the $ 2 ( stale ) chips and ( strangely oily ) salsa are a perfect complement to anything on the overpriced menu .
mexican	should be a pretty place , i wish them well . i am not a fan of lindo mich even though they seem to get rave reviews and awards . we might stumble in one day .
mexican	some one needs to update this because i just drove several miles for nothing .
mexican	disappointing . 10 / 15 / 15 @ 1pm . drove all the way out just to try it .
mexican	the totally empty parking lot dissuaded me from it .
mexican	closed due to landlord lease foreclosure situation they 're looking to reopen in new space somewhere soon .
mexican	i walked in , guy said it was closed and then he pulled out his guitar and started strumming it .
mexican	couldn 't get food . they raced to the door to close the spores as we were about to walk in . this is the worst type of employees to have . i would fire them at my store if they closed down even a minute early .
mexican	lots of frustrated customers who were trying to grab a quick bite before boarding late night flights - us included .
mexican	i 'm not really upset it closed . we always went for the lunch buffet . i would rather have a mexican restaurant with good lunch specials . hoping maybe ray azteca would go in .
mexican	other location on 6910 s. rainbow blvd . suite 100 was closed in june 2015 . only one location left here in las vegas at concourse a inside mccarran airport .
mexican	i wanted to try this place . i planned and look forward to it all week . i arrived at the place to find the sign ripped down but the stuff still inside . the landlord here must be a real peach . everything i love in this shopping center leaves . property is always being locked away . next pay period i guess i 'll try chandler . i love arizona . * gag *
mexican	heard they are moving injanuary to hayden and via de ventura in scottsdale .
mexican	no big loss either -- just run-of-the-mill gringo-mexican food and cheap margaritas made with cheap tequila and cheap bottle-mixer . nothing distinguished this place from the thousands of other run-of-the-mill gringo-mexican places across the region and the country .
mexican	not even a note on the door to say " sorry we suck today . "
mexican	? clearly said open . door was locked . no sign on door stating closed . looked inside and saw people catering out the back door . if your gonna be closed at least post it ! bad business practice !
mexican	some people have to work weekends , and it 's frustrating to walk up to a place while you 're hungry and have to turn around . if the company doesn 't have a national policy of being closed on sundays , then you should be open .
mexican	they told the paper that the glendale market is too difficult to be successful in .
mexican	noon on saturday . 9 / 23 . this is not the first time . i can 't commit to a place that doesn 't have consistent business hours .
mexican	? we drove by the other day and the signs are gone and the parking lot was empty ! ! ! ! what 's up ? their food was great .
mexican	went here to get some food along with the sunday special around 4pm in the afternoon just to find out the doors are closed and noone inside . do not rely on the prices posted with the photos here at yelp for rolibertos . i expected super nachos as seen here on the photo for $ 6.50 and was charged around $ 9 something
mexican	went yesterday to use my groupon and there was a for sale sign in the window . there was another sign saying an italian restaurant is coming soon .
mexican	they stop taking phone and internet orders more than 30 minutes before close . on more than one occasion their menu is incorrect and they run out of vegetarian items a lot . : (
mexican	close this place down this crappie is posion ... all corporate now these assholes don 't even know how to make a taco dirty , smelly it should have been a los favoritos at least make it a juliburtos all factory food now don 't eat it go to el taco felix on dobson ...
mexican	i ordered a bol with rice and chicken . the rice was crunchy and cold . my husband ordered a breakfast burrito which was pretty bad too . even if the food is bad , it should be served hot but it was cold . service was slow as well . i think next time we 'll be looking at packaged food options vs. sit down options .
mexican	food = taco bell service-terrible asked to speak to manager ya she was the horrible service . sad but true . phx landmark no more
mexican	closing down for several months to add a kfc to a taco bell that is doing a perfectly fine business and then revising your hours so that you are not open as late doesn 't impress me .
mexican	it is now 4 ; 25 and they won 't serve us . is this sponsored by the corporate office closing early ? 5 people in line and they turned them away .
mexican	sometimes the food is so bad it 's not even edible , like it 's days old or not stored properly or something .
mexican	anyone going more than 3 stars here is being silly . this is about on par with filibertos except in a much dirtier environment . dusty non air conditioned dining area with super uncomfortable seating . this is a very lds style hodge podge of a dining area . whatever could be found at the thrift store if i had to guess . nice people working there though . don 't expect a conversation however if you are from out of town . people in this part of az are very very dry .
mexican	we decide not to eat and leave . i think that for this location , food is not cheap so they need to have a pest control . i work with restaurants & i know when there 's little cockroaches is because there 's an infestation somewhere inside the restaurant . yeah i got my money back but we didn 't have a single bite of our food. so this is a very negative review. no stars at all .
mexican	every time i 've been here i wish i had gone else where .
mexican	here you go ! this was in my gringo chicken . no way ! forget it ! ! !
mexican	tacos are good , not amazing . service ... barely any . desserts : gross . we sent back the tres leches cake which we all have had many times at other places because it was gross . i told our server and she apologized took it away ( we had a couple bites ) yet for some reason we were still charged for it . hmmm . not going back .
mexican	service is okay . we came in and ordered coffee and two breakfast burritos . they gave us one . we told one of the staff that were missing one burrito and he said he 'd take care of it . thirty minutes later we 're still waiting here with no burrito . it 's been grueling watching the other people out here get their burritos . even as i 'm typing out the word burrito rn my mouth is salivating . it sucks cuz the burritos here are so good but this ..... this is torture . please bring me my long lost burrito . please oh god please .
mexican	i had to start my order over three separate times because the cashier taking my order was being yelled at by other employees less that 5 feet away . it was in a playful way but it was incredibly rude and obnoxious . the same cashier that took my order has a boyfriend here and they have been chatting it up over the counter right next to where we are seated . an incredibly unprofessional environment .
mexican	switching to pepsi just cost you our business . we used to come at leaonce a week but not anymore
mexican	very bad service . feeling like i 'm bothering . 1.50 $ for a very small scoop of guac . owner unpleasant . kind of restaurant who leaves you standing at counter without communication .
mexican	it still took 15 min and i was the only one in line ! all was paddled out of a pre made bowl . the meat want even but on a grill to warm up ! and i had to ask for my drink . pass
mexican	shitty service , went to the restroom and they had sat another couple at my table . they must have thought service was great , fresh beer upon arrival and chips and salsa immediately after they sat down ! finally got my table back , awkward ! then ordered food and finished it before anyone came back to even offer me another beer . if i hadn 't already been meeting more people there i would have left !
mexican	it was so bad i took two bites and left . first what is cabo about it ? and what is fish about it ? it takes more than a few pieces of frozen fish on a tortilla shell . lets see if taco bell can do better ? guy you must have been drunk if you liked this place of course i have never seen him visit a place that he said he did not like ? no no no i should have contacted my credit card company and disputed the charge . what a waste ...
mexican	didn 't feel liked roving all the way to chipotle . won 't make that mistake again .
mexican	wrong order again . very bad attitude in the drive through again . how the hell do you stay in business ? ? !
mexican	we had a 2 minute drive from the drive thru home and all food was cold ... meaning it was never hot to begin with . this has happened both times i 've tried here . will skip in the future .
mexican	i ordered burrito bowl with barbacoa . meat was tender but considering how cold it was , no wonder people get food poisoning . i hope i dont get sick . disappointing .
mexican	called to complain and was told that i could come back and they would remake it for me . yeah ... like i 'm going to drive back to you . how about remake it and have it delivered to me ? ? ? never eating at this location again . this is the second time i 've been burned by this location in the last month . pull your heads out , chipotle .
mexican	look at the refried beans . never seen anything like this . not even good . my burrito , shall i just call it tortilla ... because it hardly has any meat . if you want filiberto 's just go to the one in ray . it 's just about 2-3 minutes away from here . bathrooms are clean though so a gave it a two stars .
mexican	slid their cell phone down the food line and could barely take their eyes off the phone long enough to make my burrito .
mexican	poor management . we tried this place three times and this was our last .
mexican	avoid if your in a hurry and want good food a a fair price.alsp all veg / salad product old and brown . bad quality control
mexican	wrong food . horrible customer service . how can we shut this location down ? ? ? ?
mexican	with all of the nearby options , it 's amazing this place is still in business .
mexican	last 2 visits then cashier got the order wrong with the take out . dining room was in complete disarray and filthy . the health department should visit places like this on a regular basis , otherwise they would be closed for business . skip this place and go to macayos .. much better quality food , service and cleanliness .
mexican	maybe a burrito is better ? just not very good , probably won 't return again . poor example of mexican food . why me ?
mexican	we 're never going back . there are far better spots in the south side and in pittsburgh in general .
mexican	literally cold tortillas filled with cold shredded cheese and lukewarm extremely salty sauce on top . so gross . not exactly cheap either . brought them back to the window and asked to have it microwaved , was told they " don 't have a microwave .. " what ? ! the solution apparently was to drown my " enchiladas " in more awful lukewarm sauce . which obviously did not help . judging by the other reviews , this isn 't an isolated incident . screw this place . i wish we had gone to roberto 's .
mexican	this is an overhyped cenpho eatery that doesn 't deliver the goods . too many people get caught in that " it 's local with fresh ingredients " dialogue . i only care if it tastes good . our office decided to order from here so i ordered a chicken taco and two short rib tacos for $ 9.30 . i 'm at a loss to describe any good features about the tacos except to say they are small with two tortillas wrapped together around the meat . i might go back to try the burger someday . although i had a taste of their shake and that was decent . so that 's why i 'm putting this place at 2 stars instead of one star .
mexican	mediocre at best . salsa isn 't salsa . it 's puréed stuff and smells like grass clippings . wouldn 't dare taste it if you paid me . meat was below average . beans are just boiled and i 'm not sure who wants to eat pickled onions on their own . waste of money .
mexican	actually , to be fair , the torta and the nachos were delicious and are why this place gets 2 stars instead of just 1 . everything else though , including carnitas , short rib , octopus and chicken tacos ; just ... not good . the margarita was also less than desirable . top it off with a brutal live music act and all in all this was just a bad experience .
mexican	stay for the atrocious service ! first ( and last ) time for me at this place . went through the drive thru and after being told to wait a minute by the speaker , i waited over 5 minutes to place my order . also , the order was wrong . and in a town with truly outstanding street tacos , these are not remotely worth $ 3 per taco . maybe the burgers are better . i won 't be back to find out .
mexican	... after you have eaten dinner . the tacos are overly complicated without punching a lot of flavor . there 's barely any heat , even with their hot sauces . the corn tortillas appear to be housemade , but are flaccid and almost worse than if they had just bought them . it was probably the worst part of the taco .
mexican	come here if you want a mediocre burrito and you don 't mind waiting forever to get it .
mexican	the endless rotation of girls behind the counter gets worse with every new face . slow , sloppy service . for god 's sake , drain the water out of the tomatoes before you put them in the soft ( and stale ) tacos ! the burritos aren 't much better . i 've yet to see someone actually cooking in the kitchen which seems to lay dormant night after night . so , if you 're into re-heated , poorly prepped mexican you 've come to the right place - if not , well why not head over to kensington 's el trompo or el sol ( further east on danforth ) ?
mexican	i get home and got a fucking bean and cheese burrito and the kid working the counter was the most disrespectful little shit he looks like he can barely work as it is .
mexican	they have a basic menu which is great and they should be great at it however the food is below par , filibertos makes a better burrito and taco . disappointed to say the least as i was wanting a great taco and a cold beer ( cold beer they did have ) . i am sure there are better places for great tacos and burritos , this place is not it . some details : meat was dry no real or original flavor , chips and salsa were ok , burrito was more rice and beans than anything else with very little flavor .
mexican	service is dropping in quality very fast . apparently they no longer serve chips and salsa unless you ask for them . waitress not attentive . drinks sit empty and waiting for the bill takes too long .
mexican	i got there a minute late and they don 't let us in to eat . how difficult can it really be to help couple more customers to some extra tacos . i 've worked in restaurant industry before so i know how it works .
mexican	the owner needs to clean this place up . it 's in a good neighborhood but with this thing taking up so much space on a huge busy corner and being as dirty as it is , come on now clean it up ! there is graffiti , trash everywhere , some of the squeegees are missing , some paper towels are out - trash was over flowing . please , clean this place up . it also costs .35 cents to use your debit card . ugh go across the street to terrible 's .
mexican	took forever to order , then when i did i had to wait 10 min to get my order ... i get home and bite into my burrito , no joke a qtr size bone in my burrito .... nasty . and the green salsa was super watery ... i know it 's a new location , but come on get it together ... defiantly disappointed in this location
mexican	carne asada was bland and not hot cheese inside not melted beans were cool not hot . charged 1 dollar to use a credit card up sell on carne asada by 2 dollars . i get this location is across from hard rock but extremely disappointed making me think of changing to a alternate next year
mexican	the atmosphere is below average , they don 't serve alcohol. salsa average , parking is a pain , and the food is average . the service was good or slightly above average . we were so looking forward to a good mexican place close to upper st clair . s
mexican	i tried this place expecting it to blow my taste buds . at best , it tastes o-k . nothing to drive all the way out for , nothing to wait in line for and nothing to really get excited about . it doesn 't come close to gordo 's . their hibiscus drink however was very good ! we ended up making an armando palmero mixing half of hibiscus and the lemonade .
mexican	based on price and portion , i was unimpressed . don 't get me wrong , the meat is okay and nothing terrible happened , but this place focuses more on aesthetics than it does on good quality . not worth the price in my opinion .
mexican	this is not what i expected for $ 16 and if my burrito , nasty asada .. no sourcream in my burrito , barely any meat and the salsa sucks ! basically i went here becuz it was really close to my house n only thing close to real mexican food ... ughh i probably wont come back unless it for the snacks .... the food sucks to me . to each is own ... not good authetic mexican
mexican	it probably had something to do with the fact that the tacos were covered by guac and pico , two things i generally don 't put on a taco . a true gas station taco - as prescriped by www.gasstationtacos.com - should be meat , corn tortilla , onions , cilantro and possibly some crazy hot salsa . these seemed much more california , trying to be fancy . the pork torta was good , short of the massive amount of fat and connective tissue i got halfway through . other than that , solid choice .
mexican	i actually like mediocre mexican , itself a style of food . but mad mex is sub-par mexican - quite bad , actually . if this is the best mexican pittsburgh has to offer ( as the readers of pittsburgh magazine suggest ) , then the ' burgh has some work to do . the house salsa ( extra charge ) is a lousy blend of tomatoes and tomatoes . entrees were just plain bad . again , the consistently high ratings for this place mystify me . have you had good ( or even mediocre ) mexican before , pittsburgh ? the silver lining here was attentive service , despite a busy and obnoxiously loud dining room .
mexican	i had the fish burrito , there was more deep-fried batter than fish . i guess for fast food , it beats having mcdonald 's
mexican	i ordered a veggie salad and chips and guacamole . they were supper slow on the line ! ! ! ! ! they are pricey compared to moe 's / qudoba and everything is extra $ . as i started to eat i realized my rice was burnt and hard to the point that i couldn 't even chew it . overall fail .
mexican	nice outdoor bar with cooling and twinkling lights . anytime i go out to eat i read yelp reviews and every single one was bad . but we had already sit down so we decided to stay and eat . the chimi was recommended by the waiter so we ordered . very heavy . lots of onions . expensive and drinks are basically water . welcome to vegas
mexican	has happened multiple times , tonight 8 / 31 / 17 . two employees ignored me as i waited to have my order taken and then pulled to the front window where they continued to ignore the fact that they saw me waiting there .
mexican	from tacos to burritos they didnt have anything i wanted . then kept yelling at me that they aren 't a taco bell . apparently this taco bell closed a few months back , and this place took a over . i may have been a little out of line , but no reason for the attitdue .
mexican	lets start with a very average margarita for $ 12 , an $ 11 mojito made with a mix , and chips with a salsa that could call any supermarket aisle home . entrees are way over priced for a very mediocre offering . i always clean off my plate , seriously concerned with the plight of starving children in third world countries , but on this day even that thought couldn 't get me to finish . the tortillas were horrible , how the hell do you screw up a tortilla ? service was also sub par , bordering on rude . never again , or as the say in mexico , nunca mas .
mexican	there was no option of brown rice , only white rice . also less topping options than chipotle . ordered chips and queso , cheese was a yellow-ish colored queso which i don 't like and the chips were incredibly salty . service was slow seeing how there were only 2 people ahead of me .
mexican	a for effort but they can 't compare . owner was a bit too confident and they ran out of guacamole . how does that happen at a mexican restaurant ? ! i went because i had a groupon . will not be going back .
mexican	the meat tends to be somewhat watered down , with flavors that didn 't have all that much impact . if you 're looking for al pastor you won 't find it here , it 's much more frill than substance . the cook also asked me if i had been there before , and he arrogantly said " oh you 'll be back . " well sorry lupe 's , but i haven 't returned . edit : i still have not been back , as gloria 's has opened up on junction rd . if you enjoy good tacos , then there are much better options in town .
mexican	they don 't even make their own salsa - and are using a bad store bought one . food is bland , boring , and i would not recommend . the only two positives are that their staff was nice and they are open late .
mexican	the chips were too salty and too fried , the tacos weren 't as great as i thought it would be . nothing else to say . probably better off going somewhere else . : / sorry toronto , your tacos weren 't great .
mexican	i ordered a bowl and usually i 'm super full and can 't finish it . this bowl was half the size that i would normally expect at any other chipotle . i was starving after and keep in mind i 'm a smaller girl . i literally don 't need a lot to stay full but i was so hungry afterwards . the serving size is way too small . maybe it 's cause there r so many customers but seriously . don 't waste your time here . shops at don mills location is a lot better . in fact any other location is better than this
mexican	ive always gotten a whole bowl full and offered all the ingredients available while this one only offered 4 ingredient including the meat when i asked for everything . corn was there but i wasn 't given the option of getting . portioning was half full compared to other chipotles like the downtown locations .
mexican	the staff is very slow , walked in when it was empty and it took a while to place the order and even longer to choose the toppings . the amount of toppings you get is very very little . at other locations the burrito is overflowing with toppings , at this one there was barely anything on it . i literately got 6 black beans on the whole burrito . located close to my house but i 'd rather drive down the street to the dundas location .
mexican	see earlier post about leftover pickup stix furniture . tacos weren 't bad , but i hope the reviews saying they are closed are true . nobody spoke english , even for phone orders . completely sketchy . too bad , they could have cornered the dive mexican food market in this little community . save your time and money .
mexican	it 's mexican food , how do you screw up the order so bad . bad service , bad food , bad experience . soda fountain completely out of order , then they charge for a refill of watered down pineapple juice water . rolled tacos were soggy , with barely any cheese . chicken tacos needed to be held over the fryer for a few more seconds , total grease bombs .
mexican	just came back from lunch and what a horrible experience . server screwed up my order ( gave me beef as my order when i asked for chicken ) . fyi , beef is against my religion and yet i did not become aware of the taco filling until a few bites . then it took the server two times to ask what did i want in my new tacos . finally , a colleague had ask for a to go cup two times . also , the food was very poor . save yourself money and avoid this place .
mexican	i was behind three other paying customers in the drive thru . i was the last in a line . three friends ordered and got food , and they turned me away . they told me they can 't take any orders and to go away . i asked why because my friends had just placed orders and they abruptly shut me don 't . don 't go here . the staff has no manners . there 's no point .
mexican	being a native , i love good tacos . i feel like one star is being generous . uncomfortable bar , owners stared at every bite i took as if they weren 't confident in what they were trying to accomplish . the food was horrendous and overpriced .
mexican	stuffed peppers laying in a bowl of grease . margarita 's tasted like it was from a mix . salsa ? bland and like tomato soup , and only once choice . usually in better mexican restaurants they 'll offer 2 or 3 . and overpriced .
mexican	was on a budget and my daughter and i wanted some mexican food . well more like she wanted mini chimichangas with guacamole . so carambas it was . i opted for the taquitos . chicken and beef . i wanted to try them both ... i was so dissapointed . i couldn 't even tell which was which . there was so little meat , all i could taste was the corn tortilla . my daughter got the combo with rice and beans . beans had a weird after taste . the only thing good was the customer service , salsa 's and guacamole . definitely won 't be going to this location again .
mexican	now hiring sign has been up for awhile , so perhaps the fault rests with understaffing .
mexican	i cannot believe how bad this food was i put it straight in the trash
mexican	tiny portions mediocre food only good thing i can say , the service was good
mexican	everyone talks about how amazing the food is and i 'll give it to them , the quality of food is good . but flavor is an integral part of food being delicious . everything but the green chili pork is devoid of flavor . the carne asada isn 't marinated making it especially tough and unenjoyable , the hot sauce has a weak flavor , and the larger lady at the window is rude . season your food people !
mexican	never consistent in their burritos . order breakfast burrito get no egg . asked if the onions are cooked they say yes they 're all raw . i recommend burrito shack way better burritos .
mexican	still has the odd way that you have to line up to order , and the same staff . it just looks newer / cleaner . and its still just subway .
mexican	avoid at all costs . $ 2 chicken taco - great ! now 2 tacos with bately visible rice and beans on the side $ 10 . you do the math . owner 's response was the worst part - " well , you should have asked . "
mexican	have been there several times and they always screw up my order . $ 8.00 for a cheese quesadilla ! ! ! ! ! ! please support other worthy mexican restaurants and not this place ! !
mexican	condescending comments from the management to other customers will have me giving this one a wide berth .
mexican	everything we had here was awful and bland . -1 star for this place .
mexican	the tacos al pastor were way too dry , no flavor , felt like grandmas over cooked pork chops attempting to be a taco . i wish i could 've read this before i ordered my food . overpriced . i need players were not very " friendly " either .
mexican	you decided to take a political stance against this wash rag ... unfortunately others like robertos , and tacos las mexicana were open . i 've had issues a few times with my orders which were never corrected . your solution was for me to pay again because of a language barrier . now you 're mixing business with politics ! bad business practices put companies out of business .
mexican	however , i had the free chips and salsa when checking in and i asked for everything on the side and they gave me my tacos with everything on top and my tacos we 're super cold . i 'm not sure if it was because of the rush hour but regardless my food should 've been warm and well cooked . i don 't think i will be going back to this place . not to mention : i waited 20 minutes to order my food and 15 to get to the salsa bar and i paid for the tacos . so all of my 10 tacos were so not worth it .
mexican	while the middle aged woman ( who i suspect is the owner or manager ) served us with a friendly demeanor , it seemed to take forever to get our drink order , which was disgusting , we ordered pop which tasted like the machine had never been cleaned . the food was much worse though , it not only took longer than two meals should take but it tasted old and as though it had been heated in a microwave . i give this place two giant thumbs down ! i never plan on returning . i recommend if people are looking for a good mexican restaurant try somewhere else .
mexican	every type of meat was dry and tasteless , while the beans , rice and produce felt like they opened the cans days before . luckily , meals are inexpensive ... the meal wasn 't terrible , but easily forgettable . i can 't think of a reason to dine here again considering the caliber of restaurants in the area .
mexican	more importantly , it tastes way too bland . have been to too many mex restaurant in the states , i don 't think it 's authentic at all .
mexican	one visit only and only in a pinch if there 's to be a next time .
mexican	sometimes the tacos are huge and overflowing ; sometimes skimpy . the beans and rice are weirdly flavorless . the queso is dynamite . and their salsa is perfect .
mexican	some of their restaurants are clean and well run , some are not . they really need to trim the chicken of the chewy parts before they chop it up and throw it in a burrito . that really sucks .
mexican	i usually order the especial tacos and some days they have cole slaw that over flows , and some days , you get a couple of strands . today , of the three tacos i got , 2 had slaw , 1 did not have hardly any , and 2 of the tacos were almost dry from the sauce that was supposed to be there , and one taco was so soaked in sauce that the tortilla fell apart as it was soaked to the max . last three times i have been there it has been this way . restaurant is usually pretty busy and the condiment bar is usually a mess from all the people using it . not appealing .
mexican	consistently a terrible experience. i have been sitting in the drive thru without moving for 7 minutes. there is no way it should be 12 minutes to get trapped in a drive thru before they even take an order. its always messy and the slowest starbucks ive ever seen by far .
mexican	i 've stayed at this property a few times and dined at prado every time . you would think i 'd learn . food is terrible at best , service is nonexistent over 3 hrs for dinner , and crazy overpriced . anyone who uses yelp and still goes here gets what they deserve . went for breakfast next day . the chef came over and spoke to us regarding our experience . he 's trying to clean up the brand , has a lot of work ... will not go back .
mexican	specifically on one shift however . the mid shift will always at least forget one item , if not completely mixing up and order with different items . not to mention waiting in a fast food line for 20 + min defeats the purpose of " fast food . " we now only come later in the night due to constant lack of attention .
mexican	the drive-thru is slow and your order is often messed up - a terrible rendition of an otherwise good franchise .
mexican	they act like they are doing me a huge favor by serving me . the place is always filthy too . never again .
mexican	really greasy ( grease pouring out all over the place ) short rib taco . waiter could not describe the fish in any way ( it 's like a fish finger in a taco ) . sloppy and thoughtless . no quality check on anything . hostess made stink eye when we brought her attention to the above making a possibly forgivable bad experience unforgivable . too bad . we are servers and usually generous and forgiving .
mexican	waited 45 minutes for chicken one day . unbelievable .
mexican	my friend and i sat for about 15 minutes , before a waitress came . she didn 't even ask us for our order , she asked us if we were done with our menus ? ? ? luckily we were sat right next to the bar so drinks were easy to get . we had to flag someone down to order our entree , and and then flag down someone else for dessert . the waitress was really nice when we finally got one , but getting one was the problem ! food portions are very small as well . pros : beautiful patio , good drinks , incredible guacamole made right at your table .
mexican	subpar service with completely enthusiastic employees . always out of something ; fajita onions & peppers . food prep is questionable with the rice not cooked properly on most occasions . most of the time the chips are greasy and undercooked . gross . the queso is the only saving grace . skip it and go to chipotle and come back here for the queso .
mexican	i 've been to a couple fat bastard burritos locations before , but for whatever reason this one is lacking to some degree . the service people are a bit unfriendly and charged my friend and i for the wrong items . when we brought it to their attention , they claimed they didn 't know what to do and instead offered us a soda for compensation .
mexican	) . this place tries to be a modern mexican restaurant ... but i just don 't buy it . aside from straying from the typical presentation of rice and beans , they weren 't that creative . however , points on their creativity of the prices ... $ 100 for 3 entrees and one appetizer ? haha ! good thing it was comped by aria anyways ! no bueno !
mexican	simple counter and sit down service with very friendly and welcoming staff . food was just ok , but quick with a very diverse salsa bar . ventilation is an issue here , as smoke from the kitchen 's grill entered the dining area . food was ready shortly after ordering . it 's good if you want mexican food for a pre or post visit to the state fair area . i had the asada ( steak ) combination plate with rice and beans , tortillas , jalapeno , and onions .
mexican	food was served in the temperature danger zone . i always get the hershey squirts from mexican food but this time was extremely brutal . i 'm talking a four pack of charmin double rolls worth ! for your intestinal health avoid this place !
mexican	the tortillas used for the tacos are too thick for the delicate flavors inside of them which over powered all of my choices ( thai , duck , pork adavada , and cherry steak ) . i was looking forward to tasting all the ingredients throughout a bite , which were amazing , not momentarily and then followed by nothing but tortilla ..
mexican	they were out of a couple of the menu items each time as well and the food was medicore at best . i would go there again if they cut their prices in half .... maybe . service was also something to be desired .
mexican	cool ambience . i enjoyed the musicians . but the food is way overpriced . the food is average , i 've had better . service was bad .
mexican	great location in downtown chandler . overpriced food and not that tasty . there is not reason a fast food taco shop should cost 35 bucks for two people to have a burrito 2-3 tacos as small as they were , 1 margarita and and a beer . the tacos were the tiny street tacos that are usually 99cents at most places . wouldnt reccomend .
mexican	the food came out and it was obviously premade then warmed up when the kitchen received the order . i hate to speak negatively about local business but it was the worst food i 've ever had . the best thing we ate was the kids chicken strips and fries ( not a compliment or a joke ) . i felt like i was robbed of $ 50 when i left . save some money and go to filaberto 's .
mexican	cool decor . other than that , not much to say . we went , options weren 't really anything special . taste was cheap and bland . overpriced . wont be going back .
mexican	they have some good deals , like $ 2.99 daquiris on mondays and $ 2.99 margaritas on thurs , but they 're so syrupy and sugary you can 't taste any alcohol . and so filling ( and again , sugary ) you can hardly drink more than 2 without feeling like you want to keel over . food-wise , the only thing they 're good for is their nachos . the wing sauce tasted like water
mexican	and if you gone close lock the doors and put a sign on the door . i don 't know why thy have to do this every night but it is truly retarded to me , who ever is over this needs to come up with a better business plan , like seriously get it together ! ! cool people though but they have to follow horrible procedures , i will just got out of my way from now on
mexican	the tacos were not impressive at all . the tortillas were cold and the food seemed to be pre-made earlier that day . definitely not fresh . my stomach ache all night was a reminder to never go back .
mexican	what a joke , the enchiladas tasted like chilli cheese fries . my torta was on ciabatta bread & looked like it was from subway . we sent 1 plate back & they offered a free drink which they ended up charging on the bill . sorry but i wont be returning to this " american-mexican " spot ..
mexican	drinks are disgusting ! the prices for their shit food is a joke ! by far one of the worst " mexican " restaurant in phx ! avoid this place !
mexican	corporate mexican food , nothing to brag about , but for the area , adequate .
mexican	taco guild is brought to you by z 'tejas ! ! explains a lot . i knew i recognized those cheap weird chips ! ! ! ! ! tacos were just ok . i may go back for just drinks hold the chips and salsa . the place is so stinkin cool it 's a shame the food doesn 't do it any justice .
mexican	also the pricing is confusing and if you ask the employes ( ex . does a side of sour cream cost anything ? ) all of them will give you a different answer . i like the pork but a lot of the time it is hardly shredded at all .
mexican	the line is messy i didn 't even want to eat my food when i got it . staff was wondering around like they didn 't care about the line they had , i was in line for more than 20 minutes . which made the line even longer , & my meal was made incorrectly . over all this is by far the worst experience i 've ever had at cafe rio , stay out of this place !
mexican	food had no flavor , my michelada was nothing but clamato .. best thing about this place was the 10 % off .. first & last time eating here
mexican	i would like to give it a higher rating but just can 't . the food is mostly tasteless and sloppy . the price is right , but i 've noticed whenever i 've been there that the staff is stand-offish and unfriendly . i won 't be going there again ....
mexican	the only reason i knew it was a burrito is because that 's what i ordered . frozen lettuce on top . chicken that looked like it had never been on a live chicken . good news was there was enough hot sauce to completely douse it . hope i don 't get any food poisoning- i 'll be on a plane for a long time . might not let my dogs eat here .
mexican	you know how they always say " the plate is hot " at mexican restaurants ? well not this time . the food wasn 't hot either . i would avoid this place like the plague .
mexican	best description i can come up with as well . taco bell or del taco have more flavor . whether salsa or an entree it seems the cooks don 't have any spices in the kitchen . shame . great ambience but even the drinks are weak and watery . wonder if chef ramsey is interested in visiting mesa ...
mexican	have eaten here on previous trips & had it on my to do list . never again . service is just bad , food is ok , not great , and way overpriced . why eat here with all the other choices in vegas ? diablo 's at planet hollywood is much better .
mexican	my friend got the veggie burrito and it was , indeed frozen vegetables . the only flavor i could extract from my vegetarian enchiladas was salt . i understand the argument that maybe the veggie options aren 't the best representation of mexican cuisine , but fresh ingredients and spicing do go a long way . don 't waste your dough , compadres .
mexican	air conditioning was non-existent for those waiting in line in 113 degree heat .
mexican	we walked in and asked for a table for two . hostess was less than enthusiastic to be there let alone greet us . she took us to a tiny high top bar table . when we asked for a normal table / booth she said it would be 10 min even though there were several open tables available . she then said they were short staffed ; a sure sign our bad experience wouldn 't stop with the hostesses . thanks barrio queen .
mexican	the service and food were equally disappointing . the cleanliness also left room for significant improvement . easily the worst mexican restaurant we have eaten at .
mexican	still an hour wait to sit outside so we opted to sit inside which was so hot . the portions are very small for price . chips are different and not in a good way . they tasted very stale . guacamole was below average . street corn was decent . short rib meat was dry . the only thing that would have made it worse was actually waiting for a table and then being this disappointed . if you must try , get a taco at the carry out counter .
mexican	this town was built on customer service , what the heck has happened to that ?
mexican	but what a disappointment ! service fast , food cheap , but boring , tasteless and no variety . in a bowl or a tortilla. that was it ..... not what i was hoping for . glad it 's local and doing wel.but i 'll go elsewhere next time .
mexican	" finally called and found out it was open . i find it odd that they didn 't take the time to paint an " open at last " sign . anyway , i really enjoyed the other location , so i expected basically the same thing . the restaurant is very nice - but scaling up the dig includes raising $ as expected . my margarita was very tasty - better than the other spot but the food went downhill . i 'm so disappointed ! ! chips and salsa were good , entrees- just okay , beans and rice , really bad . i hope they figure it out - love having them in the neighborhood .
mexican	too many kids working there and bouncing around like a playgound . the cashier couldn 't even hear me because of the chaos and noise , and i was inside standing at the register . i felt like it was an airport restaurant . no specials and cost me a fortune . if the food had not been ice cold i probably would have given them another chance before reviewing . i just took the loss and will drive to the other locations from now on . very dissapointing .
mexican	couldn 't wait to try since reading all the good reviews i went there about 3 months ago they burnt the rice , they make better puerto rican food in hawaii alot better.and the place where you sit and eat was dirty and smelly it was worth a try
mexican	the red sauce had a poured out of a can taste . sorry but we walked out - haven 't walked out in a long long time .
mexican	i swear each worker there was moving in slow motion ; and when i asked for ketchup i got the meanest stare from the cashier . also , they really , really skimp out on the toppings . i ordered the bacon fondue fries , and they barely gave me any fries and only a few squirts of cheese . i asked for more , and the girl lied right to my face and said they had no more . it 's fast food , so i didn 't expect much ; but still ! come on !
mexican	i like the location it 's a good vibe , nice casual seating out back , hope they can work out the food issues .
mexican	i had been going regularly , and last week i was hungry , hurried and distracted . later wheni looked at my receipt i saw i had been clearly shortchanged by the counter-lady . doubt if i 'll return . or if i do , i 'll bring the exact amount . their burritos are only okay , the ingredients tend to be clumped at one end or the other . who wants a big wad of guac at the end of the burrito ? anyway , the place reminded me of the cool burrito places i used to go to in sf mission and i prefer to avoid big chains . not sure where i 'll go now .
mexican	i was overcharged by $ 5 but didn 't realize it until i checked my bank records . and with no receipt i can 't prove it .
mexican	first tiny basket of chips is free . if you want a larger , second basket , it costs $ 1 . i can understand that policy if the chips and salsa both were completely off the hook ! but they weren 't . 2 . had to go ask for a chip refill after the first tiny basket vanished in about 2 minutes . they were really friendly though . and the food was decent , but far from the best in town . standard rice , standard beans . the tostadas and tacos were the best thing we tried . there are just too many places better than this one to put it into my rotation .....
mexican	i 'm writing this from my table at si señor . i was overcharged twice ... watch out , kids meals are on the menu for $ 4.50 but they will charge you $ 4.75 . also , i had a mysterious charge of $ 4.99 on my bill .... apparently the waitress saw the manager give me a side of guac ( which was supposed to be included with my dinner and i never got it ) so she charged me for it . um ... not worth $ 1 let one $ 5.00. no taste . i tried to like this place . no bueno .
mexican	frankly , it 's for people who wouldn 't know good mexican food if it slapped them in the face with an empanada . if you like it , fine , but if you crave true mexican food you need to visit either mi pueblo ( one on lorain seems to be better than the one on the east side ) , or nuevo acapulco on lorain , preferably the former . and what 's so sad is this place is just minutes from where we live . not quite as bad as eating at the boneyard , but close .
mexican	it is not great yet it is not awful it is merely decent . i had a beef burrito and it was to say the least mediocre . one reviewer said it best if you are in vegas skip cozymel 's and find another place as i found cozymel 's to be both expensive and underwhelming . on a positive note cozymel 's has a very nice atmosphere . also it is next to hamada of japan .
mexican	crap food decent staff pricy for no good reason never going back again location looks clean but just didn 't taste any flavor on it .
mexican	took forever . taquitos were store bought box taquitos and i watched him as he microwaved them . food is bland and just plain no good . if i could rate less i would .
mexican	it 's sad that crappy attitudes and rude comments of the kitchen staff have to take away from a place that has a bit of character and a home town local spot feel . that home town feeling is when you walk to the window and the lady taking your order says hey i should of known your name , how are you ? sorry but today was my last visit !
mexican	there 's a sign posted that said " merge " to get in to the drive thru . however when i tried to merge another customer refused to let me and then hit my brushguard ! when i went to see the manager he said i was at fault and although the sign says " merge " it really means i should i have yeilded . really ? the sign did 't say yield it said merge ! between being told my a cranky manager that i can 't read , the bad area this is located in , and the aweful parking i opted to head to del taco in a nicer area instead .
mexican	what you read and order is not what you get ! if you have to verify what they put in the drinks vs. what is ordered - bad service .
mexican	save ur money and just go to mcdonalds this place sux
mexican	i 'm getting tired of yelp foodies steering me wrong . heed my warning , i sacrificed my time and money so you do not have to ! !
mexican	the food sucked and the waiter was rude ! dont go here unless you like to waste your money and hang out at a loud place ! expensive food thats not worth it ! ripp off they tried to sit me and my family in a 2 seat chair and we had 4 people ! i had to ask 2 times for a booth and they were like trying to push the chairs on me ! wth an
mexican	multiple requests for chips , queso and drinks went unanswered . will never be back here
mexican	quesidilla is tiny and terrible quality . greasy and tastes microwaved . stay away from here !
mexican	told the cashier , he resolved to tell the meat / rice / beans person about it ( but didn 't do anything for me , wtf ) . also out of pico today . chipot-lame . won 't be back unless someone tells me that this location no longer sucks .
mexican	you 're better off at the mcdonald 's or taco bell across the street .
mexican	i hate when i go to a mexican joint , and they never refill your drinks or chips . i went on a saturday night , and it was semi-busy . our food came out quickly , but the waitress never came to check on us . i shared an chimichanga meal with the boy , and it was very small for being $ 10 . the menu does not have a lot of selection , either . i finished my margarita and the waitress dropped off the check without asking if i wanted another . i was planning on drinking more and getting dessert , but decided to bail after the poor service .
mexican	the food was good , but the dirty glass makes me wonder if the plate was even clean . great fast service so i have to give them some credit .
mexican	rice was horrid and hard . they didnt 't have tortillas for a quesadilla and only enough for one corn quesadilla . the sour cream was watered down the the salsa was plain ....
mexican	i had talk to the manager and said to her i would pay extra so they won 't give me fry 's . she then said to me no because i can use that meat to make tacos and give them to my family which was very retarded when it was just me and my friend .
mexican	crazy wait but that 's fine its spring training but when my pepe 's sizzling fajita entree comes out cold and with barley any meat and also costs 14.95 along with our server not knowing anything about menu items when asked , well i would have to say they have failed.only thing good here is the margaritas and damn they were good
mexican	bland food and flavorless sauces abound . i feel you could order anything on the menu and wind up tasting the same food . everything was just bland and limp . this is the worst kind of faux-mexican food the world has to offer . tl ; dr : bleh .
mexican	carnitas torte lacking meat , got 3 / 4 thru it then i was eating a avocado sandwich . server said it came with a side of vegetable which were the carrots and jalapenos out of the jar . the shrimp diablo lunch taco two measly pieces of shrimp wrapped in two measly pieces of bacon in the tortilla with and and ice cream scoop of beans and rice for $ 8.00 .... it was not diablo at all . shrimp is not that expensive . chips and hot sauce nothing great . disappointed i hear their fajitas are good and they well should be for $ 29.00 .... server was very nice ....
mexican	had a hell of a time trying to get two spots to sit for my girlfriend and me . paid $ 14 for two draft beers at about 3 : 00pm / weekday . i guess happy hour time would have been cheaper but we didn 't want to rack up a big bill by the time happy hour started ( i think it starts at 5 : 00pm ) . left and went across the street to la salsa .
mexican	additionally , it was my first time at cafe rio , and the workers were quite rude . it 's difficult to tell which ingredients are free for certain meals , and rudely would say certain items weren 't included in what i ordered ( that 's fine , i 'll pay extra ! ) they were visibly annoyed while i was ordering .
mexican	qdoba down the street has way more menu options and much nicer staff . over all not impressed with chipotle .
mexican	i had high hopes for this place . i 'm hoping our food was just rushed since we went in on such a busy night . there was a band playing so all the tables were smashed together and the waiters were tripping over each other since their wasn 't much room to move . i had the ceviche and it wasn 't good . i wish we had been told this place was byob which would have made our experience a little better .
mexican	i usually order them from jamaica restaurant and noticed this cuban spot so wanted to try it out . maybe ill try something new next time . but idk ..
mexican	my wife and i ate here shortly after they opened and were disgusted by the slow , uncaring service . the food was alright--rather bland--but hearing " oh , i forgot " over and over from our server ( when we could find her ) made sure we didn 't return until last night when we decided to give them another try . some things never change ..... the food was bland and the service was nonexistent . we won 't go back .
mexican	nothing to special again used to go to this place a long time ago and i remember it being a lot better than it is now . sort of a bummer
mexican	music is apparently kept at a loud volume to cover the sound of the droning fans in the kitchen area . liquor in house margarita may have been measured in an eye dropper . dining room is functional , but far from comfortable . those giving this place five stars really should get out more .
mexican	have been here over 10 minutes and have moved only 2 car lengths . this is not fast food .
mexican	my friend who also ate lunch with me yesterday at this location has food poisoning as well . will never return to this restaurant and unless you want to be throwing up for 6 hours , i hope you don 't either .
mexican	this is so slooooooooow . i usually have patience for stuff but this is really irritating now .
mexican	unitil i got my burrito and took that first devastating bite ... i got the pork burrito and it was absolutely disgusting . like wow . im so grossed out right now ... instead of the beautiful blend of mexican spices and flavors i got a sickly sweet burrito mess . now it could just be me . if you like really sweet burritos than this might be your thing . its definitely not mine and i will sadly not be returning . i knew we shouldve ordered from chipotle ... * insert sad face here *
mexican	absolutely horrible . it wasnt twp minutws after my girlfriend and i got into the line that a chipotle crew member got into a very heated argument . the staff all looked they were mentally retarded and were all yellibg football plays . sadly , i decided to din in this place and the tables were filthy . crew members on break were dropping food on the floor and leaving it . disgusting
mexican	saw 7 people walk in and come out within 5 mins of going in . why have a drive thru if you 're going to act like it 's not there ? utterly ridiculous for a company whose primary appeal is speed . i could have ordered barros instead .
mexican	15 minutes now and only two cars have been served ( and they weren 't very big orders ) . every time i come here i wait a ridiculous amount of time . this has got to be the slowest " fast food " place ever .
mexican	when my order was being taken she had to repeat it several different times before she got it right . i only ordered a couple of things with zero modifications . i 'm just annoyed at this point .
mexican	no . joke . can 't exit and blocked in from cars in the front and rear . i 'm too tempted to drive over the nice gardening next to the drive thru lane . the only thing keeping me sane is killing time writing this review . as i reach the end if typing this not one car has moved forward . i 'm gonna drive thru this gardening .
mexican	it 's a fun idea . it 's also too bad that veda 's butter chicken currito was a let down . a whole wheat wrap stuffed mostly with rice , bland sauce , and i think there was supposed to be chicken in there . i paid like $ 8 bucks for rice in a wrap . at least it came with a free dipping sauce . the tamarind dipping sauce was the tastiest part of my lunch !
mexican	they also have a tasty smoothie station in which the employees will grudgingly prepare for you . and along with that note , this restaurant provides the worst customer service i have ever experienced .. period . the servers are either extremely rude , or merely spaced out . either way , it has been a terrible experience every time i have eaten there , and wouldn 't recommend it unless you like to be patronized ( or ignored ) by the worker " curreating " your burrito .
mexican	was in fact a bit condescending . couldn 't be bothered while on his phone . ordered 3 cheese enchiladas & added beef but instead of inserting , it was dabbled on top w / only a few hard pieces . nacho cheese was diluted and chips were stale . sour cream tasted like it had turned . uncomfortably warm inside . only positive was their fountain drinks were good .
mexican	i have a stomachache after eating only a few bites of the chimichanga . also ordered sopes , a breakfast burrito , and quesadilla . it all tasted really similar , like the oil they used was bad or something . really disappointing , because the food looked awesome but did not live up to my expectations , especially with all these great reviews .
mexican	food not so much , burrito bland and soggy . burrito at food court across the street operated by mexican wayy better burrito and much cheaper . mexican corn was also a bust ! had better corn for cheaper from street vendors growing up . the chef needs to sample and test authentic mexican establishments and rebrand . the margarita too sweet low on tequila . may come again if the joint across the street is closed ... the manager is awesome though and the staff ! : - )
mexican	don 't even bother ordering ahead of time because they won 't have your order , or any record of your order .. although i really like the food here , i won 't be back . 2 strikes is all it takes for me ,
mexican	every time i go to this location i am very disappointed . i go thru the drive thru and order and the person doesn 't get my order right the first time or second time . finally after repeating my order correctly i go to pay and they managed to still leave out one of the items i ordered .
mexican	customer service here sucks stop in on my lunch break i only get 30 minutes when i walked in i was told someone would be right with me i ended up leaving 10 minutes later because my order had still not been taken thanks for wasting 10 minutes of my lunch break i 'll never come back again ...
mexican	decided ill drive 60 seconds now to rolibertos to get my mexican fix .
mexican	waited 15 minutes for our burritos and there were on 3 customers in the store at the time . the burrito was pretty good but not worth the wait !
mexican	i come from la and expect it to be as good as it is there . the food is made very differently from what is has to be , not sure if they have a buget on what ingredients they spend on but overall if you come from cali and are looking for a good mariscos restaurant this is definitely not the place .
mexican	every single person there is rude ! their job is to make your order however you like it , but they get mad when you try to make it your own . the girls are talking about their baby 's daddy while serving me . didn 't even make eye contact . just threw the money on the table and not in my hands . i got a salad one time and was pretty stingy with the meat . gave me like a small pinch of meat . everyone there seems they hate their job . well guess what ..... a job is a job . be grateful you even have a job in these economy . other than the service ..... food is pretty good .
mexican	i ordered online and was told it would be ready in 45 mins . i get there 45 mins later only to find my order hasn 't even been looked at . so i have to wait another 20 mins to get my food which was all wrong anyway . i paid for side orders and didn 't get them either . they didn 't even care . i 'll never go back and i 'll take great delight in telling others not to go either .
mexican	customer service it 's horrible , i asked about the chicken burrito what 's in it and the lady who works in there with the short hair was upset she doesn 't want to explain she keep saying what , what and say the menu is over there , not professional at all
mexican	food is good it 's nice to call ahead but this place doesn 't like that . horrible experience never going back ..
mexican	chips are good . enchilada sauce is canned . beef in the rio grande burrito is canned . food is not made from fresh ingredients . try another spot .
mexican	customer service is a nightmare and managers need to focus on there performance . i am not a complainer but when your online orders consistanly are wrong and when told to call an order in from now on and then they constatnly hang up on you then you are forced to find another place to eat . food is great but they have to seriously work on customer service ! ! cafe rio has lost our loyalty !
mexican	first time being in the place we ordered off the special menu to the right of the counter and the gal didnt ask us if it was off the special menu or the regular menu even tho she seen us over by the special of the day poster . she puts our order in wrong . then she gets rude . she could of asked " the number # 3 here or over there ? " ( each no. has two diff meals ) then we were rudely told how to order correctly the next time ..... very rude on her part . i really cant see the next time happening . food was good but her customer service was uncalled for .
mexican	customer service not that great not to mention there 's nothing fast about going to this fast food restaurant .
mexican	i love love love tamales ... these where not very good and they are pretty small . i got the green chili and cheese one and the desert one a la mode ... they forgot my ice cream . my green chili tamale had a cream sauce with a strange texture to it- sort of jelly like . the taste was not much better . over all i really wasn 't too happy with this place . sorry folks .... i know it looks good- cute little sign and sounds simple enough yummy tamales but in my opinion not so great ! !
mexican	customer service skills are horrible the woman was very rude when my son walked in behind me she mentioned to another employee that he was wasting money because he held the door open for another customer i watched her take a chip and some cheese with her bare hands out of the portioned cheese for the strips and eat it over the food i have been going here for twenty years but after the poor customer service i will not return also the past couple times the food is burnt
mexican	that 's all i have to say . food is the same like in all different location .
mexican	good food . great carnitas ! . gnats all over the place . if you want gnats while you eat . this is your place . absolutely not taqueria !
mexican	i live in goodyear & every single time i try giving them a chance they always mess it up ! ! never again ! !
mexican	kept the door locked during business hours and didn 't have the courtesy to inform they were closed and instead chose to peek from the kitchen area . never going back again .
mexican	avoid the bathrooms ! ! ! ! ! ! there was feces smeared on the walls . the bathrooms were not clean in any way whatsoever .
mexican	was waiting for food and witnessed one of the male workers cough into his hands didn 't wash his hands after wards , later then witnessed the same man use the restroom came out seconds later readjusting his pants , logically thinking if he peed he didn 't wash his hands after that as well . wouldn 't recommend this location at all . also just witnessed the lady switching the trash without gloves and she also failed to wash her hands after wards .
mexican	then she came back and told us that we need to pay for them if we want them . well duh ! i didn 't expect free drinks because of your mistake . the food was dry and flavorless i 've heard so many good things about this restaurant and i came out really disappointed .
mexican	the waitress was rude after we asked if there were any other options on the menu and continued with her attitude the entire night . also , we asked the host about the menu and he told us he didn 't know and to " just ask the waitress " as he walked away form us . food and drinks were good though !
mexican	the food was okay but honestly i would 've rather gone to filiberto 's and spend that money . only reason i went there was because of a gift card . i 've had better mexican food .
mexican	rude ! ! ! did not take me serious as i am russian . with a very thick accent , i was very offended , never shall i ever return ... unless my drunk self brings me back . like back to the future
mexican	my boyfriend and i could not use the restroom because we just wanted to order drinks and we 're not dining in .
mexican	carne asada was rubbery and didn 't taste right . the chorizo was soggy and greasy . great staff but they need to fire the cook . besides the food , there was flies and it was hard for eat with smacking them away . don 't go here for tacos .
mexican	the food i was very disappointed i would rate it a 3 / 10 the menu was only a page long not much to chose from and not what i was expecting at all . funny thing is the drink menu had more options . my appetizer was the soup it was room temperature ( not hot ) and too spicy and i order a side of mexican corn which was really good ! my entrée was the tacos which wasn 't good i think roberto 's taco are way better ! lol i did order a cocktail which was ok . so for the price which is more then a traditional mexican restaurant was over priced just not worth it !
mexican	even the " cheeezy " dip , yes , cheeezy with 3 es , was watered down .
mexican	and the food was average - nowhere near justifying the high prices . service was very friendly and the vibe is fun but we won 't be back .
mexican	but i wouldn 't waste my time / money . good service . for such small plates , they really need more items to choose from , like tapas style . at least i can say i tried it .
mexican	we went into this restaurant hoping to find some good mexican food in gilbert , but were disappointed by the food . we ordered the fish taco , clam chowder , and oyster . the clam chowder and oyster were both below average . the oyster was warm and sort of gross . the clams in the chowder were chewy . the fish taco was average at best . hard to justify eating here when joyride is right across the street ...
mexican	i wanted to like it and have tried it 2 times hoping my first visit was a fluke. but it wasn 't the food was just as terrible both times . i was with five other people and it wasn 't just me nobody like their food . . the cheese crisp is ok but its cheese and tortilla. and it 's way too expensive . i work across the street and it would be a super convenient place for me to eat mexican food but that ain 't happenin .
mexican	not impressive food . literally ordered one of each tacos and the nachos and they sucked . the chicken taco had a huge bone in it . shitty
mexican	the backs are loose so the guy behind you pushes you forward . creamy green salsa and warm chips are very good ! 42.00 later ....... the food was ok .... standard at best . service was good .
mexican	but the food was strange tasting and the portions were insanely small . $ 17 for the vegetarian enchiladas is insanely expensive , considering it was half the size of a normal dinner plate and the food covered about half of the plate . and did not come with a side of rice or beans . strange taste to the salsa . almost a sweet rotted taste . i wanted to love this place because i live so close . but i won 't be back unfortunately .
mexican	raw tuna is horrible , fishy smell , not sushi grade , inedible ! would never recommend jaburrito . not good at all ....
mexican	i do not recommend going out of your way to come here . horrible parking . salsa was not good . didn 't taste fresh . hot sauce was good but not hot at all , just different . this food is in no way shape or form " authentic mexican . " 90 % of the customers are caucasian and have probably never even been to mexico . food was just okay . if you 've been to any of the tons of american-mexican restaurants out here , they 're all pretty much the same . service was pleasant but nothing special .
mexican	cool hangout but the food is just alright . quite ordinary . there are several much better mexican restaurants in town so don 't go to this one if you wish really good mexican food .
mexican	cutting straight to the point , server was bad , food was just okay and the music was really loud ; we could barely here each other while talking across the table .
mexican	cynthia at the drive thru window was extremely rude. this is the worst customer service i have ever experienced at any starbucks establishment. on top of making me feel like my order was a hassle , our drinks were not made correctly. it 's safe to say that i will not be returning to this location despite its proximity to school. learn how to treat your customers !
mexican	i just filled up my water glass with pop & put a lid on it . no idea what is going on .. always something goofy with this chipotle , out of lettuce one time , case card machine down for 2 months even though panera 's worked , too many goofy things to remember .
mexican	dam just say this restaurant on tv .. sad they closed the husband was hella stupid ! ! !
mexican	the meat tasted rubbery and chewy . the fries were soggy . very pricey but it is in the airport . however how can you label something the special when it taste like yesterday 's garbage . i had to get tums to relive the pain of gas and upset stomach . will not be going back .
mexican	why chipotle you gotta be so cheap when i don 't get rice and beans and you charge $ 10 for a damn burrito and $ 2.00 for damn guacamole ! ? flavors were actually not that bad considering i don 't go to chipotle unless i have a coupon for a free burrito or when a group , like this time , wants to go i had the steak wit veggies , corn salsa , guacamole , green salsa , sour cream and it was not too bad , just the cheapo putting my steak on was too cheap , that made me upset ! and before you ask why i didn 't ask for more , they charge for extra scoops !
mexican	ummmm ... the place was empty today too ! it 's not like they had a huge rush to get so upset about . and we said well done not burnt lol ! ! geez ! don 't get it . lol ! oh , well .
mexican	i got two burritos and a couple of drinks and the bill was $ 65 ! ! ! ! are you kidding me ? ? then , i ordered a yard drink to go , and i swear , there was no alcohol in it . i am a lightweight so i should have been drunk drinking the entire thing , but i drank it and didn 't get drunk . really ? ? the upside of this place is that the servers are really nice and the food is decent , but everything else about this place pissed me off .
mexican	ever since my saturday bean burrito i haven 't " been right . " iiif you know what i mean .. annnd i.think.that.you.do. even if there was a negative star rating , i would still give them one star . for the weight loss . i should have learned my lesson with the chicken 3 years ago .
mexican	give me food not cold and don 't stuff a lot on a street sized tortilla that 's not all the way cooked . please have enough staff so a hostess isn 't my server . the bartender did not know after being open there was no watermelon already cut for one of their specialty drinks.shrimp ceviche should have more than 10 tiny cut pieces of shrimp otherwise you just gave me tomato , cucumber , jicama ceviche ... the drinks were good but very pricey for size ... definitely not dinner place only happy hour appetizer place better than casa anejo but more expensive . back to ritos or carolinas or pepe 's
mexican	avoid this place . stale chips , pace picante salsa , microwaved food . i ordered a chimi and the middle was still frozen . server was really slow and did not seem to know the menu . the dining area is extremely shabby : ripped cushions and dingy tables . i do not know why i stayed after the first five minutes .
mexican	i wish i had seen the reviews prior to visiting this restaurant but ... it was not my choice , actually . what completely freaked me out was that the bill was $ 85.00 ! $ 85.00 for a meal for two ! for mexican food ! ? excuse me ! ! ! ? ? ? the atmosphere was nice , the waitstaff was average , and the food was sub-par . actually , the fish tacos were the worst i have tasted but my date loved the carnitas . the pitchers of margaritas are largely filled with ice . and everything is waaay overpriced for the flavor and quality of the food . i won 't return .
mexican	$ 6.50 for a breakfast burrito and $ 2.70 for a coke ? ! ? ! ? ! i 'll be taking my breakfast burro needs elsewhere . and their food quality is not as good anymore . salsa lost flavor .
mexican	i got the bean burrito and my main complaint is that it tasted bland , like it needed a pinch of salt and the taste would have dramatically improved . also , i 'm pretty sure the burrito was to include cheese and there was none . : ( i cannot say that i won 't give this place another shot , but it had better be worth pumping up greenwood in my work clothes .
mexican	he kept stalling trying to get us to order more drinks , then refused to split the bill how we asked him to . party was only 6 people and we all ended up paying way more than we actually ate or drank . so bummed with his awful service , he is a con man. bye nando won 't be back
mexican	also , i don 't get eating burritos with a knife and fork . i just don 't get it .
mexican	we ended up getting a beer and then going to a real / different mexican restaurant .
mexican	food was nothing special , they don 't know how to assemble a burrito . and apparently whether you get the largest burrito ( like my husband did ) or the kids burrito ( like my daughter did ) the fillings are the same portion . what ? ? ? ? ! 1 star for tofu , mushrooms , and cilantro options . other than that chipotle is my go to .
mexican	i was really hoping that i was going to be able to give a great review . we had the all you could eat tacos for $ 10.00. that is the special this weekend . don 't have the ground beef or shredd beef unless you would like to start high blood pressure medication . the salt content is horrific . the pork tacos were very good . the first three were very good.the rest were " where 's the beef " tacos ... it took 3 tacos to make one due to 1 / 3 the meat in each . melissa did take care of us and the rest of the staff was very attentive . beer was cold .
mexican	i 've been a big defender of this chain through all their mess . went in this afternoon for an early dinner . no line . no crowd . one person in front of me . i watched the employee slop spoonfuls of meat onto a tortilla . he missed with several pieces . some went from the serving platform back into the container . some were put on the burrito . no , no , no ! anything that hits that serving platform goes in the trash . there 's where some of the risk of cross contamination comes from . argh . i really wanted a burrito but i turned on my heels and bolted . i 'm out . too bad .
mexican	approx 8 : 15 , both are throwing up ! i have told her repeatedly that chipolte all over the country has problems with food poisoning , e. coli , dirty prep areas ( you can see it ) and more quality control issues . they should all be shut down immediately and give all the in store workers 1 year severance packages for the shit they have to sell . why are they allowed to continue to operate !
mexican	5 ppl ahead of you in line ? that 'll be about 20 minutes .
mexican	never open after midnight lately , at least put up a sign so im not sitting in the drive thru for an hour looking lame !
mexican	was asked to get out of the drive thru when trying to order tacos because they thought i wasn 't a customer . weird . they run a fast joint but plenty of taco stands in az silk manage to provide exceptional customer service . the street tacos are outrageously priced for being street tacos and the burritos are overpriced too . i highly recommend tacos mich . it is way more authentic . you won 't find any hispanic people in line at speedy . it 's ok for a late night snack . don 't recommend if looking for good mexican food .
mexican	who knows what else is there . staff thought it was a joke and laughed in our face , and offered us another drink ! ! ! ( without any sincerity ) this place is a really disappointing excuse for a mexican grill . first time there the food was good but never got drinks there . second time was a perfect example of why you should never order a drink there . let alone , at this point , even eat there . very sad and disgusting
mexican	no wonder ! food was bland with no flavor including the salsa . service was good but that 's the only positive . i have been in the area for seven years and this is my first time visiting . i haven 't missed a thing ! skip this place !
mexican	i am unable to walk back over to your establishment to get salsa , therefore i am using ketchup . this is your fault . the burrito is decent . it is huge and i got a lot of food for the amount of money i paid this morning . the tortilla has a really good flavor and i can 't pinpoint what makes it so unique . i was also excited that the re-fried beans weren 't salty ! i would rather have bland re-fried beans and add salt to my preference . not sure any of that helps , but if you order to go , make sure you double check for condiments !
mexican	we can 't help it that the airport is busy and that you are poorly managed . you shouldn 't take your anger out on the very people on who you depend for you livelihood . it 's too bad you blew us off . we are nice people and good tippers . happy thanksgiving .
mexican	you had no chicken made . not a big deal , but you said just a couple of minutes . no problem . it was more like ten minutes and it was not that busy . i wanted to wait for my entire order but you made half and then had it wait . so it was not cold but not as warm as my freshly made chicken . also annoying ? i bought chips and guac and my chip bag had half the amount of chips . i know the big cost is the avocados , but $ 3.25 and you were chincy on the chips ? don 't let me down like this .
mexican	" i am highly disappointed and will never again walk through your doors . you are extremely overpriced and have a very measly menu . the only reason why i gave you two stars instead of one ? your guacamole . p.s. you have bad service .
mexican	nothing more nothing less . i don 't want a burrito and chips with hair ! ! ! full story : i placed my order online because the line can get long at this location during lunch . i picked if up at the scheduled time and went back to work to eat it . little did i know of the surprises that lay ahead ... i 'll leave it up to you , the reader , to reconstruct what happened . protip : read the first paragraph . i 'm never going to eat here again . i start to gag just thinking about it .
mexican	i will never eat carne asada again thanks to you . i knew we wouldn 't last forever , nothing that hot and heavy ever lasts long .
mexican	i got a smoked pork shoulder pound . the employee wearing gloves handled short ribs , . knife , sliding glass compartment handle and measuring scale for the customer in front of me . ew . then , he put on new gloves , and essentially did the exact same thing for my order , minus the knife . i 'm now home sick , hot fever , stomach pains from what i believe to be salmonella poisoning . shame on you whole foods . your employee 's need to be better trained ! and i will alert the county on this .
mexican	i 'm used to people getting my name wrong , but when your coworker asked you about it , your were rude & justified your mistake instead of owning it . i 'm happy to share how rude & unapologetic you were . i 'm happy to spend my money elsewhere .
mexican	the bad thing is that this is the second time they forget part of my order and i find out when i get home . i should have learned my lesson and checked before taking off but i figured it was a one time mistake . i was thrilled a new location near by had opened buy they just can 't get it right ! also , the chicken seemed deep fried instead of grilled . it was so overcooked that it appeared to be chicharron style . please train your staff on how to treat customers and how to pack an order .
mexican	thanks for that . also , and this is just a bonus tip , if a customer outright tells you they are allergic to cilantro , you might want to ask the kitchen not to sprinkle it over everything on the plate ! you see i , the customer , am blissfully unaware of what the kitchen uses to garnish plates . you , the server , should not be ! so maybe you could hook a sister up and ask them to leave it off . i did , after all , tell you i was allergic to it less than 2 minutes ago . this might help with your tips . with warmest regards , and no bitterness whatsoever , steph
mexican	you 're gonna make people sick . also , the scrapings on the grill do not belong in the mixture of meat , that part is to be thrown away . i threw it away . thanks ! 12.00 for nothing .
mexican	i had the loma saltado and it was supposed to come with papas and to my amazement there weren 't any , not to mention the food to me was bland and i could not taste not smell any garlic and where is the cilantro ? i 've had my share of cuban and puerto rican food and i must say i was not impressed not even a little ..... it will be a long time before i return .
mexican	way overpriced -i understand you canucks have absurd liquor laws but $ 30 for 2 margaritas , come on now .
mexican	neither of the staff behind the counter were wearing gloves and were moving between touching the food and handling the cash . funny thing is there was a box of rubber gloves on the counter top . would really like to see this place succeed in our neighborhood but check yourself before you wreck yourself ! !
mexican	very small portions on the happy hour menu . tacos are on a four inch tortilla . not enough wait staff on hand , extremely slow service and mistakes to our order . loud .
mexican	decent chicken , unfort everything else was disgusting. the steak was dry , the " beef ? ? ? " tasted foul overall bad food for overpriced prices and mediocre portions. upside , open 24 hours bad side , you have to be drunk to tolerate the food
mexican	on average i wait 8-12mins in the drive thru with only 2 cars ahead of me . that 's way too long on a consistent basis . the staff needs to take a few shots of espresso and pick up the pace ! i believe it 's the way they pipe line their orders which isn 't very efficient , a new system is needed . they renovated the inside which is nicer now though .
mexican	decent customer service when they are working and not bs 'ing ....... " horrible food service ..... " no reason i am the only person at the register , 2cars in drive-thur and have to wait 16mins .... then to watch them make my order wrong and try to convince me its not ...... on a quick break and didnt have time to argue ........ i eat here because its across the street from my job , but i really hate this location .
mexican	i can let it slide once or twice but it 's been almost every visit .
mexican	arribas margaritas are like a half liter in the largest martini glasses in town . i know why people go there . its not for the the average mexican fare its definately for the fact they can order one drink and sip it all night long . i do like the fact that they serve a very good bean dip with their chips . free anything is good in my opinion . i will add that they have the worst advertising and product photography and it probably scares more people away than gains new customers .
mexican	avoid this place unless you have a lot of time in the airport ! it took me about 30 minutes to get my food and they didn 't even start half my order until i complained after 20 minutes ! the other half of my order sat on the counter for 10 minutes getting cold !
mexican	if you going to have open restaurant cocnept have something to prevent flies from taking over customer table and area , guess they trying to give you authentic street food feel with the flies . i won 't be going back .
mexican	dining room is tight ... booths are only fit for thin people and even then it 's a tight squeeze . food is overly greasy , salsa is watery , chips are mediocre and limited . i really do not see what the big deal is about this place ... it 's decent , but nothing to rave about . the best thing about the place is the fast service . you could do better ... you could do worse , but you owe it to yourself to try some place different if you believe azteca is " great " or even " above average . "
mexican	lady behind the counter is usually quite rude . today , they gave us the wrong order and refused to issue a refund . we used to order a ton of food for our staff four to five times a week , but no longer . don 't count on their management to do the right thing for even their most frequent customers .
mexican	clean the place up a little , change to decor and lose the carpet in the dining area it 's very dirty and carpet does not belong in a dining room . the food quality at this nandos has gone down a bit . i would blame this on management , even the wait staff says managers all have different ways of running the restaurant . this should be fixed , all managers need to be on the same page so everything works smooth . it 's not rocket science , just common sense . come on guys fix this place so i dont have to drive farther away to another nandos .
mexican	we ordered the half pitcher of margaritas , was brought the whole pitcher . we pointed out the mistake but they still charged us for the whole . never came back to ask us how the food was . walked past our table multiple times but finally had to flag him down to ask for a refill of chips and salsa . also had to ask for the bill . terrible service .
mexican	i gave this place several chances to get it right , but the woman at the counter was consistently awful . i won 't be back .
mexican	order came out completely wrong . took the food and receipt up and explained what was wrong and they informed me what i had ordered was indeed correct ... but it wasn 't . they took the receipt ( big mistake ) and told me they would " fix " it and bring us the correct food . after 10 minutes , they forget . ended up talking to the manager and since they had a few other people in line with similar order screw-ups , they just refunded us our money and we left , half-full and with no desire to ever eat at another el pollo loco again .
mexican	poor service with miss communication and negative attitude from the " manager " shows this place doesn 't deserve our families business . first and last time we will go to el pollo loco .
mexican	horrible service ! don 't come if you are in a time crunch .
mexican	decent food , not authentic mexican food but it is filling , salsas are a little better than the salsa picante pace , waiter was helpful but since they were closing , was a bit pushy to get us out , place closes at 9pm which is strange where i come from , all mexican restaurants close at 1 or 2 am , kind of disappointed at mexican food in this town
mexican	staff is hit and miss on some days . sometimes they are very polite and other times they act like they don 't care . decent food wouldn 't go more then once maybe every 6 months .
mexican	location of restaurant is a little odd but not a deal breaker , the decision to not do anything about the appearance inside is a deal breaker . food and prices are standard , in an area with a ton of options for mexican food not sure how this location makes it to the top .
mexican	i didn 't realize personalities could be that pretentious but after my second encounter i 'm convinced otherwise . i 'll be attending a different rubios going forward !
mexican	server neglected us when we didn 't order alcohol . no free chips and salsa . good portions . liked the chicken enchiladas . overpriced but could be worse for a strip restraunt . kinda hidden and small . made a nice lunch . lots of light and color in the decor .
mexican	i sat in my car waiting on drive thru for 30 min and never received my food . i was second in line and so myself and the 6 other cars behind me all left . also , be aware of possibly getting the stomach flu or food poisoning ... it happened to myself and a buddy of mine . not sure if it was an ingredient in the food or improperly cooked . who knows ? eat at your own risk . but will i come back ? ehh maybe .
mexican	lady was rude at the counter . i like this chain ... maybe i 'll just have to go to a different one next time .
mexican	useless staff . plenty of other and far better options in the immediate area .
mexican	decent grub , pretty poor service ( okay it was her first day , she said ) and mediocre atmosphere ... thinking you either have to be a true dive mexican place with awesome food , or hit cantina instead .
mexican	decent ( if over priced ) mexican food , but the absolute worst service of any restaurant i 've eaten at in my 8 years in las vegas ... bar none .
mexican	staff lacks personality . very dry staff but food was pretty good . very close to my work so prob would come back but wish the staff was more excited about having a job . food was good , little light on the meat but overall i would give this location a 2 star .. i have been to better subways in goodyear . very friendly staff and it 's fun to go in there .
mexican	decent mex carryout , big on fillers , if you don 't want beans , rice , sour creme , and want a good large meat burrito , with cheese , cilantro , and peco.in my opinion , it will be half the size , and is no bargain , if you like all the fillers its worth it .
mexican	if you liked it before ownership changed from one sibling to the other , drive the 10 minutes and go to toro loco off of cunningham . much better food , better lunch menu , and the serving sizes for food are much more generous .
mexican	it was filling , but definitely greasy . they don 't offer free chips like most tacorias which is a bummer . if you purchase a drink they do offer unlimited refills ( horchata included ! ) . i also shared the carne asada fries with a friend . that was a huge serving and had plenty of meat , i was not disappointed . the only problem was that you got really sick of eating it . would i come here again ? yes , but its not a spot where i 'd suggest going to first . -1 star for no free chips , -2 for mediocre food
mexican	atmosphere is good , parking seemed decent , but pricey for what it is . bean and cheese burrito + chips and salsa shouldn 't cost $ 13 . burrito was decent but you can get better quality for much cheaper elsewhere . also wasn 't a fan of the tortilla chips .
mexican	the all you can eat surf and turf was really good . avoid being sold pitchers of beverages unless you ask for the price first . not to mention being charged for water that we didn 't ask for . nice atmosphere and good food but the cost is extremely high for what you get .
mexican	better for breakfast because afternoon they start just dumping grease into every recipe . don 't waste money on the fish tacos or soggy tostadas . much better mexican food around but ok in a pinch .
mexican	decent salsa but chips were crumbly. really good abondegas soup .
mexican	not as flavorful as qdoba or chipotle . sub-par hawaiian food
mexican	shrimp cocktail was excellent ! have to say the corn on the cob was very disappointing . multiple people had to ask the staff to wipe down dirty tables before they sat down to eat . and the service was very slow .
mexican	since when was it ok to use mozzarella on a taco ? most likely won 't return .
mexican	i remember the other charleston location being worth the drive across town , but this new one kind of sucks . super nachos were crap compared to what i 've become used to from similar places like roberto 's . this was a little bit of chips w velveeta and chopped up chicken , not fall apart tender chicken tinga like you usually get . getting drinks near the general area of the bathroom reeks of sewage . positives are good horchata and really great refried beans . that 's about it - i 'll stick to my tried and true roberto 's
mexican	lunch line was 45 + minutes . they have 3 lines which is incredibly confusing . no help from any employee , which would help the line move faster . outside , in the 100 + degree weather there are no fans , no misters , no service . tacos were like $ 1.40- $ 2.00 each , and not worth the wait . i 'd much rather pay $ 15 for 3 tacos at cabo wabo that are made with much higher quality ingredients and taste a whole lot better .
mexican	big picture opinion ... meh . chips and salsa were good . everything else was just ok . will be searching for alternatives when the next hankering for mexican creeps in ...
mexican	pretty expensive for 1 taco $ 4.25 compared to other locations that are $ 3.25 . the pico de gallo was watery . the only thing that i liked was the chips and guacamole since the guacamole was tasty . the pork tacos and carne asada tacos had no flavor and tasted bland . not authentic mexican food . tasted fake as in not mexican whatsoever . the cashier who looked hispanic ( didn 't get her name ) was rude with her response when i asked " how big were the quesadillas to share for 2 people " by responding negatively " 4 tacos was a lot for 2 people . " my wife and i will never be coming to this establishment again .
mexican	it 's annoying that you drive somewhere with the expectation that they will be open because that 's what the hours of operation claim , yet they decided to close early because it was " slow " ( asked an employee who was taking out the trash ) . we asked her if we could still order food because they were supposed to be open . she said , " sorry we put the food away . " overall i 'm annoyed .
mexican	seems like they really improved on the house margarita this is what we had last time so i think this place is going to do very well
mexican	i ordered the tofu ranchero burrito . it was really bland , to be honest . not bad , just bland . i had to add salt and a bunch of salsa from the free salsa bar to give it flavor . it also un-rolled itself after two bites , and i had to finish it with a fork . i 'll probably come back and try something different another day .
mexican	save yourself and drive the extra miles to get better service .
mexican	the burrito i ordered was poorly made and rushed . in addition , cafe rio was out of rice.i dont understand how during businesses busiest times , they could run out of a key ingredient . this displays poor management .
mexican	we waited for 1 hour before being seated , after being told the wait is 30 min and seeing a ton of people go in front of us who came in after . the service was terrible , one person in our party didn 't get her food til 15 minutes after everyone else . and the food is way over priced , a burrito with 3 items in it is 15 and .75 for every additional item and 2 tacos are 13 for just meat and a side of beans and rice ! the only bright spot for this place is the chips and salsa . awesome chips and 2 salsas plus beans . all in all i will not be back just for the chips .
mexican	got back to the room and the cheese was all congealed . steak didn 't have much flavor . eh .... saw a bunch of people getting the margaritas though . guess they had a groupon on deal . looked good !
mexican	got a 3-piece meal and the dude told me they were out of white meat ( how can you be a chicken place and be out of white meat chicken ? ! ) didn 't matter to me though because i prefer dark meat . dude even gave me 4 pieces instead of 3 to make up for it . however , the only flavor was yet again that of old grease . disgusting . this time i definitely won 't be back ! !
mexican	i added several pictures that will speak louder than any review i could write . stay very far away from this place .
mexican	bad idea . grease , grease , and more grease . i couldn 't even stomach taking more than a couple bites . upside : the guacamole and chips are pretty good . i 'd take a pass on this location at least .
mexican	we will not be going back . red and green burrito 's are very bland . no flavor at all . as a matter of fact has a lot of flour added . rice was mushy . beans , tamale , taco , chips and salsa were ok . they only have a carne asada plate . no carne asada for tacos or burritos . never heard of that before . wow ! that is just strange . they are very clean . that 's was the only good thing .
mexican	once again i ordered the polo fundido . it was over cooked and had almost no chicken in it . the salsa was so bland , good thing they have salt and pepper on the table . has been a long time since we went here , we used to come every week . it will be a long time before we go back !
mexican	biggest mistake ever . my husband ordered a carne asada torta , the meat was undercooked and the bread was hard . i ordered two chicken tacos , the oil was leaking out of the bag . we couldn 't eat it . the bowl of cereal was much better . definitely doesn 't deserve the one star .
mexican	food was pretty bland , 28 for a steak with no taste and the tilapia wasn 't any better . with so many other choices i don 't think we would return .
mexican	the service was among the worst . the waitress with glasses was rude and clearly having a shitty day or life . couldn 't really tell . the different foods on my plate were either bland or salty . the tables around me were covered in dirty dishes . definitely not coming back .
mexican	their ensalada is surprisingly good , but very disappointed with their chips and salsa . the salsa was flavorless and the chips were stale . pupusas had no flavor whatsoever . tasted like masa and that 's it . the sauce for the pupusas was watery and not great . the building overall was nice and clean but could use some upgrades . needs much improvement .
mexican	employees spilling drinks all over the counter , employees moving the food pick up all over the place . mass confusion and disarray . i feel lucky i got my order right and food right . got the ultimate chicken grill with a small chili . maybe they were having a bad day . but i won 't be back here for a while .
mexican	the food was good the first couple times i was there . i walked in about the same time this other fellow did and we stood there waiting for somebody to take our order . this young man came out brought some food for a table so i know he saw us , place is not that big . he went into the back and never came back out . we stood there for awhile and i left . never and that 's a log time will i return .
mexican	big mistake . this place is overpriced for low quality food ( can get better food at filibertos or one of those corner restaurants . food is not authentic not even tasty ! i order the chicken flautas the chicken didn 't look nor tasted like chicken . all i can say is that i won 't be going back .
mexican	asked for no sour cream , and there was sour cream . also , they were out of nacho cheese . second bad encounter in a row with taco bell .
mexican	flew to vegas and made our 9 : 30 reservations . the table side guacamole was good . drinks were ok but very small and very expensive . entrees were shrimp fahitas , and short rib burritos . both were ok but nothing you couldn 't get at any cheap mexican joints . wait staff was top drawer .
mexican	clean , nice decor . the menu looked amazing ... unfortunately the food was bland and not saucy enough . it was spicy , but flavorless . i had to add salt to everything . my son only ate the lettuce . sad . portions are small compared to other mexican restaurants . we will not be returning .
mexican	decided to sit at the bar , bartender not very friendly the table was dirty asked for it to be cleaned she just did a quick wipe and it was still dirty the 12 dollar margarita tasted like mix and no tequila , i will give kudus to the shrimp ceviche it was really good , decided to eat the rest of our dinner elsewhere i 'm gonna add to this they gave us our check and didn 't even thank us for being there , totally need to learn about customer service i didn 't want to leave much of a tip but my daughter is a server and suggested i leave at least 18 % anyway geez
mexican	bad idea . the salsa tasted like a spicy tomato sauce , no chunks of any vegetable , it was horrible . my side of rice was way undercooked and i sent back a bean and cheese burro . took 2 bites and couldnt take any more . the beans were beyond grainy and tasted like they originally came from a can that had sat out for days and had been reheated . seriously not good . my husbands enchiladas were mediocre at best . just keep driving .... : - (
mexican	i thought this one would be just as good . to start off it looks like a small fast food joint . nothing crazy but it looks clean ! the food looked good but that 's about it . its gross not edible and grosssss . the rice was rotten the avocado was older then me . just a bad place over all dont waste your money . sorry
mexican	i ordered the fajita salad or i mean what they called a fajita salad . this was anything but a fajita , there was one green pepper in my entire salad no onions and just a half piece of chicken breast and some lettuce . i was very displeased so was the other 5 people i was with . if i were starving and there was nothing else to eat around i 'd stop in but being a local here in vegas i won 't be stoping back in anytime soon ..
mexican	after nearly 30 minutes in the drive-thru we get home to discover more than half of our order missing . one would think that when the people preparing the order take as long as they did that they would at least give you a complete order . needless to say , don 't think i 'll be choosing this location to meet my bagels needs any longer .
mexican	i have to say i now understand why they only have a 3 star average . it took a while to even be greeted when it wasn 't very busy . the queso was runny and the main dish came out luke warm with an after taste of freezer burn . i would not suggest this place .
mexican	wish i didn 't . service : unfriendly staff with poor ability to both get us seated and to recommend / explain dishes and drinks . food : easily the worst mexican i 've had in the city . my steak was incredibly undercooked ( basically raw ) and when explaining this to the waiter i received a " i think that is how it comes " recognize it 's a new establishment , but certainly a blemish in the great lineup of other restaurants that leslieville has to offer . go to la carnita instead .
mexican	my two tacos maybe weighed 2 or 3 ounces . they was barely any lettuce and the lettuce was the most of what they put in the taco . i would have had to order 4 of the meals to match any 1 meal at other fast food places . when letuce which has no nutritional value is the main ingredient in your lunch you had better find another fast food place to eat at .
mexican	we were seated right away for a friday evening then it went south from there . the waitress ( alex ) was very rude and seemed to be in a hurry to take our order . when i told her we weren 't ready she basically stormed off . we asked for more salsa when our cheese crisp arrived and chips and she ignored us . a waiter brought out our main course and asked him for the salsa and he brought it but basically dropped it on our table . we will never go there again . i would rather go to taco bell and get better service .
mexican	in all honesty , this place is just not good . the closest i can compare this food too would be day old taco bell at three times the price . for the most part , the food did seem fresh ( cold but fresh ) and the place was clean but just didn 't care for the food . i don 't recommend this place if you can help it .
mexican	nope , not for me . very mediocre , almost no flavor to them . taco shell tough . husband had the shrimp lightly breaded and fries , i think that was a bit better . these two orders + 2 beers was almost $ 40 which i thought was pretty pricey . i had to try it but i won 't be back .
mexican	pricey menu for typical food . the tacos ( i ordered two ) were super small .... not even kid-sized , more so for an appetizer , and that 's if you get three of them . you need six tacos to make one regular sized taco . won 't be returning . barrio café is still my favorite restaurant with the word barrio in it !
mexican	i ordered the sweet pork enchiladas since it was the daily special . they came with rice , choice of beans and a small salad portion . usually with these assembly line type places the food is only luke-warm . and .. this place was no different . the beans had very little flavor and the sweet pork tasted like it was covered in sugar . it is almost a carbon-copy of cafe rio including the bright colored chairs .
mexican	guess what same rude service as the last time ! plus it 's so hot in here with no air conditioning ! worth driving up to the w. charleston location . no wonder we were the only ones there ! !
mexican	first of all half the rice in it was uncooked . the veggies tasted old and stale . the shrimp was probably the only good thing . i got it with sour cream and hot sauce . the hot sauce wasn 't hot at all . definitely disappointing especially spending close to $ 12 for a small portion . not your traditional burrito bowl . didn 't feel good eating it : (
mexican	just about the worst mexican food i 've ever had . my chicken tacos were bland and i almost needed a magnifying glass to see them . my boyfriend 's chicken enchilada tasted like something my mom would have punished me with when i was little . service was horrible ( they forgot my drink and got my boyfriend 's order wrong ) . all i got out of my trip there was some leftovers for my dog and a whole lot of gas .
mexican	out of four of us , none of us were impressed . the waitress was the only positive experience . the tacos were mediocre . the cheese enchiladas were tiny . the chile relleno was extremely spicy when they are typically mild . they use cheddar mix blend of cheese rather than authentic mexican cheese . overall was just not impressed .
mexican	called to make a reservation since we invited some friends to meet us there . no answer , no voicemail , no information on the website . still went because localdines.com advertised it and sold us a coupon that same day . well , the place was closed for renovation . what a waste of time . it would be a good idea to create a voicemail recording to let people know that you are temporarily closed .
mexican	it was awful . even the chips and salsa were bad . everything was very bland , and my dish that the waitress confirmed had no meat in it , was full of giant chunks of pork . ate around the pork , but the rest tasted gross anyway . apparently the kids meal was good - but it was chicken fingers , lol . would not go back ; worst mexican food i 've ever had .
mexican	not all that . asada tacos are too salty . not good for my cholesterol . won 't be coming back .
mexican	food was super bland and overpriced . wont be back .
mexican	poor guy behind the counter had to handle the register and prepare the food , while another guy counted the tip jar on the side instead of helping get the line down . i was the third person in line and waited over 15 minutes to get a bagel . the guy ahead of me order a burrito and it took them over 5 minutes to cook the eggs , then the burrito ended up on fire . the man asked for his money back and left upset . they didn 't have lids out that fit their cups , and the veggie cream cheese only had green onions in it . not impressed .
mexican	street corn , 5 stars ! tacos , a let down . the fact is that here in phoenix there are so many options for tacos , and when your tacos are overpriced and not as good as others i 'm not going to go back . but their corn is great , i 've gone back just for their corn . the corn and decor is the only reason i would think about giving them 3 stars . it 's no doubt a cool spot to grab lunch and post pics on instagram if you 're into that sorta thing , i just prefer food over decor .
mexican	unfortunately the food has changed and for the worse . the corn pudding is nothing more than an egg omelet . the open faced tamale is just a regular tamale and the beef green chili nothing more than a can of roast beef with some green chili 's added . don 't know why we ordered dessert but the deep fried ice cream was also pretty pathetic .
mexican	margarita poured from giant plastic container ( not made fresh ) , tasting mostly of sour mix , bad tasting liquidy salsa , overly dried up rice , and way greasy tacos that completely fell apart . oh , and i asked for guacamole and it never came . would not go again .
mexican	bathroom was not very clean . after waiting for 1 hr for menudo , finally had enough of waiting . went to ask what was taking so long . informed that " menudo was not ready . " checked their health department grade and they got a " c . " will not be eating that menudo after all .
mexican	imagine if taco bell opened a restaurant with table service ..... actually taco bell may have better food . i 've been here maybe 4 times total b / c i always forget its no good . then i get my food and i remember : " oh yeah , we hate this place . why did we come here again ? ! "
mexican	$ 18 for an enchilada plate that is not worthy of the price tag . $ 10 for chicken strips & fries on the kids menu . chips & salsa were tasty , but not enough for me to come running back . i 'm disappointed as i was hoping to find our new favorite restaurant being that we live less than 5 minutes away . i guess i will keep looking ! we will likely not be back for these ridiculous prices .
mexican	decor is cute that 's about the best thing about this place , food has no flavor , like they used no spices while cooking : ( rice and beans were so sad .. and staff to focused on each other , save your money .
mexican	if you like bland mexican this is for you .
mexican	warm it up and serve it ! ! just not right ! ! ! !
mexican	pollo rico was dry . chips and salsa tasted like pace .
mexican	their problem is that chipotle grill is a block north and burrito boyz is 4 blocks north and both are far better .
mexican	was not impressed at all ! their carne asada is basically flank steak . it was not marinated or cut up . i was drawn by the good reviews so save yourself the time and go someone else unless you want american mexican food .
mexican	i 'm mexican and know good food when it comes to it and even though we live near mexico it 's still hard to find good mexican food . this place was a baby step above filabertos .. the menudo was super salty and very greasy the salsa is mild and don 't expect chips and salsa in your to go order . the chicken tacos did have quality meat , seemed to be all white chicken , but don 't expect it to be a stuffed taco and the rice is bland and mushy .
mexican	small menu ( beef or chicken ) no chips and guac , which is my fave for taco accompaniment . combo platter is huge . mix of beef and chicken , side of tortilla , beans , salsa , onions . they gave a fork , but no knife . the beef came in bite sized pieces , but chicken was still on the bone . made a mess . friendly staff , clean tables .
mexican	don 't ever order to share cuz they will charge a dollar fifty for a second sleep whether you use it or not . the bloody mary was really spicy and thick the food was okay but then again airport food . and $ 30 for one drink and one meal to share course !
mexican	with a couple drinks in your system the food is great but not so much sober .
mexican	i got the shrimp tacos and we shared the nachos with pork . the nachos were better than i had anticipated , but the shrimp tacos were just plain silly - they came with some sort of pathetic 1000 island dressing trying to cop a chipotle accent . stop it !
mexican	portion sizes of protein have been extremely small and have to nudge the team for more of every ingredient . frustrating , but tasty .
mexican	hopefully it is short lived . food actually used to be good , not any longer . prices are as other reviewers have noted , absurdly high . service is not good . the salsa , , , bland . and being the room is small and there were several business diners who have not the tact to keep their voices down , the place was deafening . guess one should take a clue as you walk in past dead and dying plants around the place that something has gone very wrong . hopefully , the next occupant will be observant of detail .
mexican	definitely a place to come when you 're drunk because the food is not very tasty meathead weird texture almost crunchy like not in a good way like all fat tortillas or undercooked so they were yuck girl 's nice though try to help and how much she can won 't go back
mexican	the air is moist and the environment somehow both dingy and vibrant . without caution sneaky dees efficiently accommodates it 's clientèle of college era partiers . if you 're hungry try the grande burrito stuffed with catfood .
mexican	staff is friendly but the food is not as authentic as you might expect might as well have gone to a felibertos !
mexican	update-2 / 8 / 17-why do i torture myself by coming here yet again ? as i write this i am sitting in the drive tru . i would pull off but the drive is designed that once you are in line there is no way to pull around or back up in my case since there are 5 cars in line behind me . i 've been here 20 minutes . after i made my order , the girl working the window accidentally left her mic on and i could hear a coworker yelling in the background to another employee about a mixup in scheduling and this went on for minutes . i will laugh about this later i guess .
mexican	shrimp in the enchiladas was overcooked , shredded beef under seasoned , and the fajita meat on my salad was grey , rubbery and poor quality . customer service was good , but will probably make the trek down to gilbert to the actual rancho de tia rosa next time .
mexican	i love the food here . we drove for 30 mins to get the best mexican food ever ! the mohave location has no air conditioner , rude employees and will not give you a box to take your food home . i asked if i could pay for a box and then received one . they started cleaning before they closed . they turned off the soda machines and took the salsa . i went to the register to see if i could buy more salsa and they said they did not have anymore . highly unlikely . i was really disappointed . i will be back to carolina " s but never to this location .
mexican	arizona is probably one of the few states that you can find amazing mexican food and this place is not one of them . the actual restaurant was adorable and had a great outdoor patio . the margaritas were good but nothing special and my meal ( blue enchiladas ) were just alright . any mexican restaurant that doesn 't start out with complimentary chips and salsa is just lame to me .
mexican	then it proceeded to land on the guacamole spoon . gross ! the young gentleman ringing up my purchase whose name is apparently logan based on my receipt , asked if i was going to a " light show . " i 'm not sure where that question even came from but when i said no he replied with too bad . rude .
mexican	) service was ok aside from getting stared down by the manager and 6 other waiters the entire time we were sitting in the patio not even going to comment on the entree true churros are not served here . we drove 30 minutes for fake churros : ( music was on point though
mexican	he then began to put my talk to you on the press grab a dirty rag then pick up pan to put in holder once he put the pan in holder begin to make food without putting on new gloves . once he brought my food in putting back he tossed it on the counter . he then gave me the price without give me a receipt . i will not recommend this to my worst enemy customer service in cleanness it 's terrible i did vies you to keep looking i don 't normally write reviews but this was definitely worth sharing
mexican	i had the carnitas and the meat tasted like it was boiled without seasoning . the rice tasted like it was the boil in the bag type rice or maybe it was microwaved .
mexican	very meat-oriented menu ; rice is cooked in pork stock , but the black beans are not . salsas in their " salsa flight " are almost all puréed except the cucumber pico which just seemed like cut up cucumber and not a lot else . guacamole was too lemony and wasn 't freshly made . i ordered a shrimp burrito without cheese . presentation was nice but there was only pork-rice , shrimp , cheese inside . it was disappointing . not only was it made wrong with cheese , but it was boring ... flavorless and dry . i 'd recommend this place if you 're a gringo who likes flavorless food but not to anyone who actually likes flavorful or spicy dishes .
mexican	the ambience is very cool , they have a nice patio area and the inside is spacious but still intimate . unfortunately the service was not as fast or attentive as what i am used to and didn 't know much about the menu . again the food was the worst i 've had while in charlotte . the only thing that was worth any time was the spicy salsa and chips which you could buy at walmart . the area that the restaurant is in is in a growing neighborhood of plaza midwood which is great but this place does not hold a . andre to other restaurants in the area . just go to azteca on woodlawn .
mexican	this is all very unique food and tacos . my kids didn 't eat one bit of their food because it was so unique . i like the baja shrimp tacos and thought they were decent but everybody else 's food was pretty much wasted . maybe i just have some really picky eaters . we went to mcdonald 's right after ha .
mexican	it started off bad when they brought the chips and salsa . the chips where thick and the salsa didn 't have much flavor . i ordered two tacos , pork and beef and both were pretty dry . my husband ordered the chicken burrito and it had more flavor but still wasn 't great .
mexican	the service was average , but the quality of food was not . for the price you pay , you get little quantity , especially for being a texas style restaurant . i order chicken quesadillas , which is hard to go wrong with , but they managed to do so anyways . very little chicken throughout the whole thing . it tasted very bland . the salsa was mediocre . the queso was not something i 'd ever recommend . it tasted like a cheese-whiz and tomato soup . again , not texas style . maybe i had high hopes walking in the place , but for the prices they have , it 's not worth it in my opinion .
mexican	the portions seemed pretty small based on what they charged and the flavors were pretty bland . i had the cheese enchiladas with rice and beans . the enchiladas had hardly any sauce and were very greasy . the rice was really blah and i didn 't even touch the beans . on the up side though the service was great ! very fast and very friendly .
mexican	i 'm just giving it two stars because the tacos were only $ 1 & the wait wasn 't long . but i don 't think i would come back unless i try something else besides the tacos : / if you 're getting lit inside of the bar it 's connected to though , i would understand why they 'd taste good : - ) lmao
mexican	this place has a bad sewer smell as soon as we walked in . the waiter seems pissed he has to be here . bad service . the burrito was cold and watery .
mexican	the meat was okay but their fry oil is terrible making the chips , tacos , and anything else you deep fry taste old . i am amazed of all the great reviews since it wasn 't great. for it being dinner time there is only us and one other table . other than the food , the service was great and friendly .
mexican	i thought it was be a cozy taqueria with style , but it was an overrated yuppie scene . food was entirely mediocre . bland , bland , bland . service was slow . overall- meh .
mexican	there was nothing special about the meat , tortillas , or salsa . we tried the asada and pork , both were not even average . go to any taco truck in la and it will be faster and better than this joint ! highly disappointed and would never recommend .
mexican	especially for the 3 tacos for $ 10 + ? we had 9 orders of it one time and it took an hour to make ... we were getting very anxious and annoyed . when we told our server we wanted to cancel our order she finally went to the back to check and brought it out . smh . an order of tacos comes with 3 tacos , rice , and black beans ... it does the trick if you 're stranded in vegas and can 't find any tacos if you 're craving some . interesting name too . can 't say anything else about restaurant since we did a to go order .
mexican	if the tacos where the regular 6 inch size that would make it a little better but those tiny tacos are worth $ 1 in los angles , california . the actual food here is not even that great . the baja fish taco is so small that it looked like a joke . only came here because seven lives tacos y mariscos was closed : (
mexican	i got two tacos , didn 't like one and they didn 't offer to change it or take it off my bill . also you have to pay for chips and salsa or sign up for a stupid app and post a picture of your chips and salsa and you get it free . i 've been once and won 't be returning . the outside seating area looks nice and is popular but not nearly enough parking available .
mexican	its refreshing to sit and wait 30 minutes for your order and afterwards wondering if the reason i feel like vomiting and having explosive diarrhea is either a gift from god pushing your faith or possible food poisoning . i don 't know if i 'm just lucky enough to be the only person to feel this way especially on god 's day ( taco tuesday ) or if they were in a big rush during dinner rush hour . won 't be going back again .
mexican	their chips and salsa are really good and the place is beautiful . their entrees are not good at all and they are very high priced . my husband ordered a burrito and it was mush . a mushy $ 20 burrito . i ordered the street tacos and had to send them back then , i ordered the shrimp tacos . the tortilla was falling apart and they were just filled with lettuce . when i finally bit a shrimp , there was almost no seasoning so all i could taste was lettuce . i ended up paying for a meal and not eating it . : (
mexican	they are also always low on stuff and wait until it is completely out before asking for a refill . one visit they claimed they were out of guacamole and were not going to have anymore for the night . he place was going to be open for another two hours . i asked if they could check the back fridge and what do you know they came out with guacamole . either the employee 's are not just smart or they don 't care . i am not sure which is worse .
mexican	literally taste like canned chicken and the queso is like jarred cheese from walmart . everyone i was with hated it . the service was good
mexican	between horrible drive thru speaker noise , wrong orders , and unpleasant service it just amazes me that they keep it open . i actually drive right past it to the other location on 40th st if i need mcdonalds . do yourself a favor and let this place close like everything else nearby .
mexican	overrun with under 20 somethings ordering cheap tacos . hostess seated her high school friends who showed up thirty minutes after us and we waited . will never come here . awful experience .
mexican	he actually stated that he bagged it and wanted us to take it to go so they could clean . he only said this after we ordered and paid ! he was rude , not customer friendly and really seemed to have cared less ! i will definitely register a complaint with the owner . i will elaborate more when i get on my laptop .
mexican	i wasn 't very impressed with the menu and was frustrated that they advertised baja food when it wasn 't really baja . a lot of the dishes also have fruit in them and i 'm honestly not a fan of strawberries in my mexican food . valle de luna or zocalo are the best mexican restaurants in town . the only thing good about tia rosa was the tequila .
mexican	deifintely not what i had expected after giving this place a 3rd try ..... never was any better than the 1st or 2nd times ..... burger was way over-cooked , green chili was weak , i have had better out of a jar from el pinto that is true new mexico quality ... supposed fries were potato cubes fried and no flavor other than the oil they were sitting in on the plate ... 3x times and still not any better ..... hard to believe the family is the same as the real new mexico los dos molinos ... that at least is excellent real new mexican food ... i walked out the 2nd time with my wife and youngest child due to poor service as well ....
mexican	i let them know and they replaced the taco , and gave a refund for that taco ... but of course the meat all came from the same batch . kinda gross and although the tacos were tasty it was hard to put out of mind .
mexican	never going back . sorry . not worth it to end up laid out on the bathroom floor all night .
mexican	however , service is appalling ! they treat you like they 're doing you a favour ! food is very overpriced and twice already they have not included all the items in my take-out order . i know , shame on me for not checking my bags , but i would expect a business to have better quality control . with other churrasco options in the city , i cannot recommend going here .
mexican	the only thing i didn 't like here is the employees attitude .. ( her name cecilia ) no smile and rude. other than that it 's great mexican restaurant .
mexican	service at bar on 08 / 26 / 2016 evening was just awful . bartender spent 20 + minutes chatting up customers at one end of the bar , ignoring everyone else . my order never came . just paid for my quesadillas and walked out . i 'm sure food is great but i definitely won 't return . service is absolutely abysmal .
mexican	unfortunately , i ordered the carne asada fries and the fries were almost raw . it was so disgusting . the chicken quesadilla was ok . the guacamole was lacking flavor . i will never order from them again .
mexican	tacos arrived cold . they were the saddest tacos i 've ever eaten .
mexican	my nachos were bland and mush . his fajitas looked like soup . we will not be ordering from here again .
mexican	the drive thru is unbelievably slow and they never get orders right . tonight they were actually taking an order .... then serving that car before they would take a second order . seriously ?
mexican	fries were cold and way over done and when i asked for fresh ones the server looked at me as if i had just asked her to cut off her own arm . i also had the del beef burritos and the meat mix must have been left over from the am shift . it was tasteless and room temperature at best . i tossed it all in the trash . i like del taco i remember it from it 's naugles days . but i 'll never eat at this one again .
mexican	the queso fundido , table side guacamole and shrimp tacos were all positively adequate .
mexican	it is bad even for fast food . if you must eat here stick with their mexican options , because everything else is gross . even still i always prefer taco bell and i am not crazy about that either .
mexican	never in my life have i been so upset with an order i received in the drive thru that i actually got in my car to go back after sitting down to eat , until tonight . i just wanted chicken soft tacos , but instead i got tortillas stuffed full of lettuce and cheese with 3-4 little bits of chicken with an average size of my pinkie nail , the largest no bigger than my thumb nail . soft tacos aren 't that big , i can 't believe it was too much to expect that i could at least get a little chicken with every bite .
mexican	henderson nv , step it up .... yes its 6 am , and few choices at this time of day . however , your open 24 hrs . i spent $ 12.00 on your " epic " carne asada burrito and a med coke .... the meat was like a dried scab , it was cold and tasted as good as shit ! if its not something you would eat , , , , dont sell it , i mean come on ! ! ! food costs should be after quality of product . yuck !
mexican	don 't waste your time you will be disappointed . even the meat was hard and tasted old . not to mention this place is pretty expensive considering the portion size is very small . i have no problem paying more for good tacos , these are just trash .
mexican	the food made me sick . i would rather have taco bell .
mexican	the " manager " is rude . won 't be going back .
mexican	the manager was nice enough to make up for it but i don 't recommend this place . there are so many better options in vegas .
mexican	did not get the drinks we ordered only water . when i asked to talk to the manager , who was a blubbering idiot he just shook his head and said he 's been here 25 years .... so what he screwed up . then offered me no solution and charged the higher price for the meal i didn 't even order and couldn 't eat . $ 38 for a taco and water . do not eat here !
mexican	at first glance , you can automatically tell that this will be some white washed mexican food . greeting you at the front door are some girls that look like they just stepped out of their shift from the corner strip joint . the service is lousy . no one ever came to serve us . we waited and waited ... a total of 15 minutes . bye idiots ! never again .
mexican	the food is decent at best , and it becomes worse when you look at that $ 8 price tag for any form of meat burrito . the environment is pretty bland and unwelcoming . if you 're in a rush , feel free to grab a burrito and sit at one of their plain , stiff tables . however , if you have some extra time to walk , there are plenty of better burrito places downtown .
mexican	terrible . the beef taco meat was dried out , and without much flavor . my cheese enchiladas were full of unmelted cheese , and the entire dish was lukewarm at best .
mexican	this location is the worst one that i have been to . they are understandably busy with asu right down the road , but the staff is rude and unfriendly . since moving to tempe i have been to this location a handful of times but i have never had the engaging and friendly experience like i know other locations have to offer . i will drive out of my way to go to the rural and guadalupe location because their staff is always friendly . this location has gotten my drink wrong on multiple occassions and my drink often looks sloppy or doesn 't have the lid on all the way . needless to say , this location has a long way to go .
mexican	in an airport restaurant . turns out that taberna wasn 't actually as bad as all that - the bar is nice to spend a few hours waiting for your flight , and the titular blue burrito - despite not being blue in any way , shape or form - wasn 't too bad by fast food standards , and quite plentiful for the $ 8 i spent on it . and if you don 't like it , you can cover it with cholula , close your eyes , and pretend you 're eating somewhere better .
mexican	if you have the slightest clue as to what authentic mexican food is supposed to taste like than you won 't enjoy this place . i think it survives due to a pretty good location on main street and the ignorance of the average consumer . unfortunately the options are limited when it comes to mexican food , but do not settle for this place .
mexican	this is false information they are providing to people , and when people have moral issues with consuming meat , this turns into a huge issue . i will never eat here again . i do not support businesses that are dishonest .
mexican	if you order something that needs to be called back to the kitchen for , you risk getting completely lost in the line while you wait . our fajita veggies were forgotten about for the nachos which caused the other food to get cold , especially because when they ran out of sour cream instead of keeping our place , they served four people ahead of us while it was retrieved from the back . no big deal except their food all ended up getting made completely before ours , leaving 3 / 4 of the food we ordered on the table to get cold . foods good , process sucks .
mexican	i 'm sorry but we did not enjoy at all .
mexican	food was mediocre , pretty small proportions for a mexican restaurant . it was ceap , service was friendly , lots of parking .
mexican	is it authentic ? not really . is it the best quality ? eh , not so much . but it is decent , and i enjoyed my chicken burrito . my issue with mexi-casa is the amount they charged . my i felt the portion was pretty large and i didn 't end up finishing it- but don 't think i wasn 't charged ! i thought the drinks were over priced as well . i would come here if i was really hungry and craving a burrito in dormont , ( that happens more than you think ! ) but otherwise i 'd rather drive to a mad mex .
mexican	how 's that for a start ? ordered two " roasted steak " burritos through foodora . delivery service was fine but the food ? -mushy -watery -bland -asked for extra spicy , and what we received wouldnt even classify as mild because it was flavorless both of us has stomach problems and diarrhea as a result . can 't speak for other locations , but this one is an absolute embarrassment .
mexican	this place was so bad i was actually embarrassed for them . the food was so not good , the silverware was dirty and service was bad . i had read so many bad reviews but i went anyway because i liked their name . i originally thought " how can you f # $ up nachos ? " you make them tex-mex style that 's how . i can 't stand tex-mex , way too much corn on everything . gross . regardless of their style they were flavorless and nasty , i had to smear sour cream and tapatio over every bite to get them down .
mexican	ordered a carda asada burrito , the girl on the phone said 10 minutes . so i go in 10 minutes , i wait in line for 10 minutes ( 20 minutes left on lunch break ) . get to the front of the line , i say hello- i have a pickup order , the girl says for ? i say a carda asada burrito .. and she said no , we have none since this morning all out . so i ask her i called in an order , why did you take it and not let me know if you were out of product . she doesn 't say anything or apologize .. super rude .
mexican	what 's the point in having this option if the employees can 't do the job and make it to have ready for pickup .
mexican	than being said that 's all they have . been twice to the same location and both times been walked by by several waiters and waitresses without being helped for about 20-25 minutes . the place is not crowded or full whatsoever so i 'm not sure as to why the wait was so long while others where being served around me . i gave it a second chance because the food was good but i won 't be coming back after the same service and no change . both visits about a month apart . like i said they have good tacos and that 's it .
mexican	the soda is good . they barely give you cheese or sour cream on your burro .
mexican	surprised it had four stars ! salsa was sweet not spicy , meat smelled weird , beans had odd taste and worst of all we didn 't feel well after eating here . will not go back ! would have been better off going to taco bell !
mexican	if you want to order to go , make sure that you check your food correctly .
mexican	the enchilada sauce was watered down. the tostada shell was burnt and soggy . possible . very nice people and a clean restaurant . but would not go back .
mexican	waitress confused my addition of " chorizo " as " chips and salsa " despite multiple corrections . ended up with no chorizo and a bag of bland tortilla chips .
mexican	too many flies and perhaps one of the reasons i suffered with food poisoning . will not return . peace out
mexican	parts were cold and very greasy . tacos fell apart . meat was tasteless and tough . rice had no flavor . beans were the only thing that tasted ok . we ended up throwing almost half of the meal out . service was average , kind of felt that they were doing me a favor . they forgot one item , fortunately did not charge for it . will not return here , many other choices available .
mexican	meat had decent flavoring , but my chicken quesadilla was almost entirely onion and there was hardly any meat . definitely not satisfactory . the carne asada fries are okay , but we will not be going back .
mexican	did not even get to order my food ... came here late at night one time with me my wife and a friend ... apparently some guy named ben was closing out his drawer and decided to close the whole restaurant down so that he can do so ... turning down for customers in line waiting to order ... then proceeded to tell me that he will not take another order and to come back later ... this is a 24 hour carl 's jr ... just a little disappointment sorry carl 's jr .
mexican	did not have a good experience there. no team work had to get find someone to give me my check so i could leave
mexican	did not know about this place so i recieved a restaurant.com coupon and i decided to go try it , " this is why they promote there so people can try it " got there and lady did not want to recieve my coupon becasue she says that it needs to be in a printed format , when restaurants.com states that either printed or mobile use is acceptable , she was rude and did not even try to make things better , terrible customer service so i decided it was not worth it after all , once you have poor service who knows what they will do to your food back there .
mexican	barely any meat in my fajitas . salsa had no flavor and they put sour cream drizzle on everything ... my husband wont eat sour cream but there was no way to scrape it off since it was all over .
mexican	do not understand its appeal to others . table prepared guacamole was boring -- throwing a few pomegranate seeds into it does not make it tasty . the yucatan entree cocinita pibil was a mess , both visually and taste wise . too bad , i love that dish . no outstanding flavor this time . just bad . in addition , waiter was inattentive . had to wait 30 minutes for a table as no reservations are accepted . would not go back . phoenix , you can do better , can 't you ?
mexican	was pretty surprised because vegas usually has good food . chips and salsa was not good . had the chimichanga and it was dry . service was ok . would not go back .
mexican	way over priced for the quality of food . it is a different type of mexican food than what i am traditionally used to .. i did not like that they charge for everything , even for rice and beans , also charged $ 4 for an extra taco for the kids plate ! probably will not return ..
mexican	i went here with my mom and the first thing she said when we walked in was " does it smell like roaches to you ? ... " we decided to stay since it was getting late . the place was dirty ( water spills on the floor , sticky tables and chairs ) and the food was flavorless . we got the 2 pc combo , one with rice and black beans and the other with mac n cheese and broccoli and i couldnt even finish my meal cause it tasted plain like no seasoning or something . so if you like flavor try something else .
mexican	should of know better since there was no one in there food tasted bland flavorless sorry to say this but i 'm not coming here agin
mexican	the burrito is shown with red sauce they put green . also the order was online and when i showed up at the specified time the food wasnt ready . i waited 15 minutes
mexican	the rice was undercooked & felt like hard seeds in my mouth . the steak was very chewy & reminded me of jerky . the server was also chewing gum while preparing my food - gross & not ok . oh , i almost forgot that i came @ a very inconvenient time for the staff because even though i was the only customer , i had the nerve to interrupt their gossip session . i will definitely be contacting corporate about my experience because i 'm sure i can find a much better overpriced burrito elsewhere . i 'm upset that i don 't have the option to give 0 stars .
mexican	service was very slow . soup was flavorless . the fish taco was too fishy for my taste . my husband 's skirt steak taco was good , but that was about it . place is clean and small . tacos are between $ 1.89 to $ 2.99 each . i will not be returning again
mexican	the waitress tried to convince me that the brown salsa was red .
mexican	they had our favorite ( casa nobles anejo ) . but the bartenders were pretty poor at mixing a good margarita . i asked for a grand marnier float and he poured it in the shaker after the tequila . the mixes they used were mediocre at best . the drinks were $ 14 , similar ones would hit $ 18- $ 20 at the " finer " bars . kind of sad to have really good tequila but not the bar talent , although given the appearance of the place as a basic taco joint , i didn 't expect much .
mexican	the waitress was so rude as i walked in . no " hello , " but just " don 't sit at a 4-top " needless to say i turned and walked out . good food tastes bad with horrible service .
mexican	front door service to table was excellent ! waiter .... not good , didn 't bring straws even after we asked twice ! i had to get them myself ! food temperature was not good-corn luke warm so was beans and rice . meat was not seasoned taste bland ! not returning , this was our first and last time ! waiter wasn 't attentive , the hostess was and brought us more water . nope won 't be back there .
mexican	customer service was horrible . everything on the menu they were " out of . " waste of my time and gas to get there . they should 've just closed down until they moved to their new location ( wherever that will be ) . what 's the point of staying open when they have no food to serve ?
mexican	tried calling in to make sure they were open before we ventured out , but the clerk that answered the phone was incredibly rude . i didn 't hear him the first time and his response was " did i stutter ? " cool service , bro
mexican	we waited in line for 40 minutes and the line barely moved . we didn 't come to vegas to stand all day , so we finally bailed and went somewhere else . which is unfortunate , because we were really looking forward to the food . in our 40 minutes standing in line we also noticed how many people save seats for long periods of time , leaving everyone else with food no place to sit and eat . this entire place is a disorganized disaster . not sure the food is worth the wait . i guess i will never know !
mexican	the host tried contacting them and was unable to get a hold of them . they just completely ignored his calls and we were all left without food . thank god for pizza . do not hire these people unless you want to risk having them not show up
mexican	didn 't even taste the food the smell when we walked in was so bad i had to run out and vomit it like literally smelled like farts in there if i ever hear that they fix the smell i would be willing to try is but as of now i 'm sorry i can 't dine and smell horse fart at the same time
mexican	i got the burrito which was a substantial amount of food , but $ 10 is a bit pricey for a burrito . but i guess that 's to be expected cause your @ the mercy of airport pricing once your behind the boarding gate . i got everything on the burrito so i 'm not sure if one of the fillings made it salty . overall it was " aight " definitely not the best burrito i 've ever tasted , & i 'm sure you could do far worse .
mexican	didn 't even give me receipt , lack of customer service when i asked for ranch she rolled her eyes and walked away
mexican	last time i went to the one on lake mead and had a bone in my bowl now in my burrito ? ! no matter what location i go to i get bones i give up on el pollo loco .
mexican	while driving by , my tummy encouraged me to stop by to fuel the soul . it was pretty busy too which made me even more eager to try their food . i ordered two pastor tacos and one carne asada burrito with beans and guac which came out to about $ 20 . yes , the tacos were bigger but the meat came out dry , tough , and were not seasoned well . my asada burrito was even more disappointing as i found out majority of it was guac and beans along with about 10 pieces of meat . quality wise , i was only impressed with their tortillas to be honest . back to el gordo and don tortaco i go .
mexican	didn 't give me straws and then argued about it when i asked . still didn 't give me enough straws , i didn 't realize until home . never had an issue before with a different location . it obviosely matters where you go .
mexican	didn 't get my quesadilla and my bean burritos both had lettuce n tomatoes and all i asked for was no onions and my cinnamon balls were old af got home ad was so disappointed it 's now been the third time in a row they messed up my order least i got my taco right
mexican	tried to use an entertainment book coupon but was told they won 't take them . they said the entertainment people never contacted them . somehow their logo and menu items were in the book . oh well ....
mexican	didn 't put the lime in the fish tacos . the fish missed the tortilla and was sticking out a whole out the side of the aluminum foil the cabbage missed the tortilla . no lemon in my ice tea . i love del taco but these folks are not paying attention
mexican	meat was odd and too much fat on it . low quality . salsa was good though .
mexican	charged 6.50 for bagged chips and what tasted like pace picante for salsa . i couldn 't see or taste the mole on my mole enchiladas and the service was not good either . would definitely pass on eating here again .
mexican	the margaritas were decent . salsa was ehh , just had brisket tacos for apps ... cute patio . live music , as in the guy with guitar singing " la bamba ! " wouldn 't go back . crowd was kind of boring . other places along scottsdale blvd looked way more lively .
mexican	reminded me of eating at disneyland , overpriced and mediocre food . $ 4.75 for a single steak taco with barely any meat . an order of chips and guacamole is a cup filled halfway with guacamole then covered with salsa and cheese to fill the container to the top . $ 4.50 for that is a joke . if i order guac i want a cup of guac not some other stuff thrown on top to try and make me feel like i got a full cup of guac ! ! i won 't be returning . i can get a better meal for my money elsewhere .
mexican	didn 't like my chicken burrito one bit - chicken pieces were blackened to the point it was not eatable and in general no flavour at all. very dissappointed
mexican	wet burrito was good though ! not coming here again sorry but bonito michoacan is way better
mexican	got the oxtail and it was very boney , tough and the flavour was too strong . there was way too much cinnamon and allspice and it gave you heartburn while eating it . had a slight bitterness from the amount of spice . it had a decent heat , but had to douse it with hot sauce to make it decent enough to eat . they give you a small salad with lettuce leaves and 1 slice of tomato and a little container filled with kraft italian dressing . they don 't really care about making authentic delicious food here . the lady at the counter was nice so i gave it an extra star , but if you want good caribbean food , go else where
mexican	there was 5 of us and out of all 5 of us , only one said their meal was ok , not horrible . the food was very bland no flavor not a good experience . chipotle has more authentic tasting mexican food , and better food , then this place .
mexican	i never had it look the way it did the time i went to this location. when i spoke to the waitress she said that it was fine but i was not happy at all .
mexican	bland and boring . small portion . chicken was tasteless server was even boring . i could have made better fajitas and enchiladas . my husband wasn 't full and he had the enchiladas . wouldn 't go back
mexican	don 't know her name so i am describing her . she fixed my food and got the order wrong . she had a bad attitude and was on facebook . her instant messenger was calling her while taking my order . the owner eddie was very nice and apologized for any i inconvenient i had . i order grilled shrimp tacos but the shrimp was just boiled . the tortilla was cold even they she put it in the warmer . i will never eat her again . sorry too many good restaurants to get bad food and bad service .
mexican	ordered some chiles asados and drop one of the chiles on the floor picked the chile from the floor and put on my ordered , real disgusting , not going there again and not recommended .
mexican	service was sub-par , rang in a totally different meal for my friend than what she had ordered . menu doesn 't specify all of the spicy ingredients in all of the meals . salsa and queso is overpriced . i 've had better mexican food at cheaper restaurants . best thing about this place was the back patio on a nice evening and the margaritas so i would go back for happy hour .
mexican	wish they had argentinian style empanadas ( which are out of this world ) . have also tried empanadas when in santiago , chile and these don 't really come close .
mexican	service seemed aloof . dishes were quality but not that interesting . espana in vancouver is superior in my opinion .
mexican	not good . terrible . don 't get it . they 're serving either really old and rotten mussels that they don 't even clean . 75 % were undercooked , with the mussels still sticking to the shell . otherwise the interior is nicely decorated . the cheese / fruit tapas was good , and so was the bread with the chocolate butter . but really they should stop advertising that special .
mexican	but it was very bland and dull . i shiver to say that chipotle might actually be better .
mexican	bland salsa , cheap quality food and cleanliness no bueno . the service was great and affordable but unfortunately not impressed with the food .
mexican	the food was a little bland and uninspired , but that seems to be the state of mexican food here in vegas ... seriously , do i have to go to del taco to get a good chicken taco ?
mexican	sopes were pretty bland - could have used more salsa but that costs extra too . so price vs quality means i won 't be back
mexican	didnt want to honorate my tuango coupons for the date and time i 've tryed to get a reservation ... i 've called 3 times , for 3 different days and times
mexican	the chips are stale and the red salsa must have came out of the microwave or something because the temperature was hot as i am not talking about how spicy it is . a avocado salsa tastes like who knows what but it was no good . chipotle and qdoba grill are much better choices in the area if you have a hankering for mexican .
mexican	i ordered tacos and a burrito . the guac tasted like onions and a bottle of table salt ... yuck typically the food here has consistently been cheap and cheerful yummy food . what happened ? ? ? ? ?
mexican	it 's usually exceptional but the last two visits we were surprised that the food was not as good . the chicken quesadilla which is usually excellent did not have grilled chicken as usual . it was sliced from what tasted like a roast chicken . the avocado was blackened and you now have to ask for the avocado crema which used to be included . even the salsa tastes different . bring the tried and true back an we will return : (
mexican	well known for the very hot and delicious food , we were very disappointed on our recent visit . the food was not spicy at all , so much for those who like it hot , which is their logo ! ! one of our guests was even served a large portion of fat ( more than half of the meat in the meal ) in their carnitas , you would have thought that the cooks would have seen this and not served it ! ! will not be coming back next time .
mexican	i was at chipotle next door waiting to order when suddenly this terrible stench fills the air . it smelled like vomit or old , unwashed socks ( and it wasn 't just me who noticed , everyone started looking around wondering where the smell was coming from ) . the smell was located to two girls who brought their axxio pizza slices into chipotle . while leaving , i walked past axxio pizza where i was yet again greeted by the vomit smell coming out of their building . it was nauseating . maybe something was cooked too long or some spice was too strong , but pizza shouldn 't smell like that .
mexican	you will know that it has totally given up once they change the name for third time to one of those ( ril ) ( fil ) abetos places ... stay away for your own good
mexican	nothing " hot " about the hot sauces- either green or red . the half of a cup of watery salsa was inadequate to mask the flavor of the greasy if plentiful tortilla chips ( for which no plates or napkins were offered ) . the chili relleno and frijoles were the blandest i have ever eaten outside of a chain restaurant 's drive-through . the television blared a raucous mexican talk show to an empty dining room . loud , tasteless , plastic decor for easy clean up with none of the authentic and endearing kitsch brought back from the homeland .
mexican	" service can be hit or miss , grandma waited an hour to get her food while everyone else got theirs . i ordered my favorites ... pollo ala plancha , plantains , and a mojito . went there to try their " $ 5 lunch specials ... figured would take advantage of lower prices since the usual prices are a bit high for the food . was very disappointed to see items like chicken fingers ( was this meant for kids ? ! ) on their value menu . they could increase business by lowering their prices a bit .... $ 16 for chicken with onions and beans is not the best deal .
mexican	service was fine , ambience fine , ran into friends--perfect neighborhood night out . too bad the kitchen didn 't deliver even acceptable fare . appetizers : why can 't chips be warm , cheese dip warmer ? mains : the enchilada was okay but carnitas had too much cinnamon , green chili sauce was unremarkable . and why can 't cook follow server 's note on diner 's choice of beans ? why can 't fish tacos have more than an overcooked finger of fish ? why all that cabbage slaw i 'm still trying to digest ? wanted to disprove other reviews but nope , have to join the chorus .
mexican	terrible service , way overpriced for just a notch above taco bell ! don 't waste your time until management gets their head .... when is vegas gonna understand people are fed up paying gazillions for substandard food drinks & service
mexican	try viva zapatas on e. craig rd. if you 're in north las vegas or lindo mihoacan on flamingo rd. in east las vegas . you 'll get more bang for your $ $ .
mexican	overall , mediocre experience as the food was nothing special , and the service was slow . i 'll give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt as they were also in the midst of the taste of the danforth festival so staff resources seemed scarce . i would like to come back on a regular night to give it another go . recommendations : bacon-wrapped dates and red wine sangria
mexican	let 's start with positives , the space accommodates large groups , the pond and wildlife make the surrounding unique , and the chips were good and abundant ( menu stated we would be charged for chips after the first free basket , but that didn 't happen ) food and service were mediocre . taco shells , for instance , were fried so crisply that they shattered when you bit into them , leaving all contents to drop to plate . taste of other entrees was " off . " margaritas were overly sweet and not worth the price . bottom line is that there are so many good restaurants around , give this one a pass .
mexican	had a bad experience . service was bad , slow waiter food was cold by the time it get to us . unlimited wine was not coming often . meat was chewing , its just on and on .
mexican	greasy , unappealing , low quality -- that 's your food . someone obviously put a lot of time , money and love to build this business ( from the decor i 'm guessing it was once an interesting , somewhat upscale place ) . today , it 's a dump . i ordered the chile relenos . the beans and rice were overcooked and tasteless . there was more egg than chile , though it was hard to tell because of all the cheese congealing over the plate . i 'll never go here again .
mexican	unfriendly staff , long wait times and staff seemed confused on what they were supposed to do . about half way through the meal the staff got more friendly and we had a better dining experience . atmosphere and decor are great . food was pretty good . we got nachos with beef , guacamole , and baja sauce . baja sauce is great ! also got a mexican pizza which was good . nachos seemed a little skimpy on toppings but wee pretty good . overall decent experience but they could use work in service .
mexican	cars are being served in the drive thru , so i guess they are open in some capacity . no signage explaining why the doors are locked .
mexican	ripped seat cushions and a messy condiment bar . drive through does not get orders exact ( e.g. ask to hold the cheese ensures a hamburger with cheese ) .
mexican	tables not cleaned , trash everywhere . if i ever come back here it 'll be take out only .
mexican	was not busy at all . food was average . i had the carne asada burrito , it was good . rice was dry . the margarita wasn 't great , lemony but didn 't taste like a margarita . won 't be back .
mexican	the apps were good . my friends husband was served and avocado that had turned . the drinks were terrible . 2 drinks with olive oil on top were sent back . i know it 's a holiday but hey ran out of beans . beans ... our bill was over $ 400 .
mexican	even the salsa was boring , the manager was very nice .
mexican	to expensive for the food you get . this is like going to applebee 's for a steak. it will do but that 's it .
mexican	between order counter and condiment table floor needed serious cleaning . sandwich looked barely thrown together compared to other locations . this arbys did not offer pepper sauce which i have seen at all other locations . did not offer any military discount which all other locations have offered even if only slight . the only good thing about this place is that the food came fast although i think that he quality of the sandwich and the lack of other customers during the height of lunch hour was the only reason it did come fast .
mexican	makes a dumpster out back more appealing to eat out of . tables are never cleaned , plates and silverware usually have leftover food on them . there is always pop spilled everywhere near the machine and the bathroom quite literally smells like your local dump . staff is friendly , but i wouldn 't be surprised if there aren 't insects and rodents all throughout the restaurant due to huge lack of cleaning and hygiene . it 's a shame they let a place get this bad , it use to never be like this .
mexican	though you probably figured that out as you drove by .
mexican	the horchata i bough was bad . the onion on my burrito bas now white nor a normal color . the taquitos tasted old and omg horrible mexican food here i have a video to to show the salad . bar
mexican	counter in bar is nasty and smeared with icky salsa . asked bartender to wipe it . still gross .
mexican	you would think the manager would jump in and help sped things along when there are about 10 people waiting ! ! !
mexican	dirty . dirty . discarded papers , cigarette butts ( who is smoking at a gas station ? ) , discarded gatorade containers , discarded food , and so much garbage in the cans they are overflowing . i felt perfectly safe here but i feel safe everywhere . if i have any option i am not going to use this gas station because of all the debris .
mexican	dirty dirty dirty nasty place do not eat there specially do not in inside you 'll be disgusted. please get your act together and clean that nasty place up .
mexican	this place was so disgusting dirty . the front counter dirty ! the glass door for drinks crazy dirty ! the small sink for employees to wash hands crazy dirty ! everything looked dirty ! the employee with glasses and blue hair stones outta her mind . i was terrified ! ! i didn 't even dare eat there ! ! just left there btw 11 / 27 / 2917 11 : 20am !
mexican	door . trash overflowing on to floor . then you get your food ... the seasoning bar is dirty , spills and scraps of food . we remainwd in the resaurant for 40 min . the counter staff made no attempt to clean the season bar or pick up trash . i made a call to customer service . he didn 't even ask my name or contact information . he said that he would make the management aware of the problem .
mexican	i 'm thinking this place is over due for an inspection * nudge * nudge look past all that , get your food and it was so-so . i was over expecting due to the extreme yelps . to each there own right , maybe it was just hard to enjoy the meal with all the screaming kids & parents that hardly noticed . or the messy setting . we 'll never know .
mexican	dirty floors after they 've been mopped they didn 't even move chairs because they were french fries on the floor where we were sitting tables were clean when we walked in at two in the afternoon i had to ask him to clean tables not too happy with this location in my own neighborhood !
mexican	i don 't know what happened to this place , used to go hear all the time for lunch back in 2012-2013 , and i just recently tried it again and omg ! i barely recognized it , first of all - service sucks ! a bunch of teenagers working and not paying attention to what they are actually doing , hanging out and being loud in the table area . secondly , everything is dirty , from the stoves that are missing buttons and covered with dried grease , to the overfilling garbage cans with splatter on nearby items , to the floor , tables , drink station , i mean ... disgusting ! will never go back ! yuck !
mexican	burnt chicken . the last two time i 've eaten at this location i 've gotten food poisoning . go to the centennial location instead .
mexican	the employees were nice but i won 't be back to this location .
mexican	even staff look as if they are dirty . i ordered and everything i requested was wrong . beware of this location .
mexican	the gas didn 't blow my car up , and it made it work ... but the lot was dirty , all the trash bins were over-flowing .. so since the gas did pump had to get up a star to 2
mexican	tacos were dry , plantains burned , salsa bar filthy . crowded & for how much we spent , i would rather have gone to paco 's . the quinoa avocado bowl with barbacoa was good though .
mexican	terrible service and the food is nothing to write home about . we ordered chips and queso , received a basket of tortilla crumbs and luke warm dip . we asked for more chips , but they never came so the dip turned cold and was wasted . the table actually had dirt on it and the plates were dusty from sitting outside . it was a huge letdown as we went for my fathers 75th birthday . wouldn 't recommend this place or go back again !
mexican	meat quality was nasty . never again . yuck .
mexican	two steps below frozen ... went on a saturday night and you just look around and you see the slop everywhere . the floors are dirty , the restrooms are dirty and the tables are dirty . the food is terrible . i called over our ditzy server and asked her to take my wife 's meal off the bill . the margerita was served in a plastic cup that looked like something you would find at a roadside eatery in the 1970 's ... just very poor in every respect ... try manual 's over by the 101 in scottsdale for really nice mexican food .
mexican	the quality and portion sizes were not worth the price . the worst mexican food i have ever had .
mexican	we were all disappointed with this chilies because some chilies are very nice and clean . and our service was slow . now we know why the restaurant was almost empty at 12 : 30
mexican	bad-tasting drinks , salsa , and guacamole . haven 't even been served my entree yet . very unimpressed .
mexican	and so busy . obviously we don 't get it and or have been spoiled by fresh quality ingredients all over town .
mexican	smelly ! ! walked in and the first thing that hit me was the smell .. omg ! ! ! cigarette and toilet piss .. no joke i felt like i walked into a freaking smokers house . all the tables were filthy dirty. wth ! ! dissatisfaction to the fullest .. i just hope the owner wakes the fuck up and turns this place around ... food was good tho . ps : no fumen en el restaurante pendejos . ! ! !
mexican	so dirty . the staff is awful . i had to pull napkins out of the cabinet myself because no one could be bothered to refill the dispenser . it 's not that this chipotle is really busy , the employees are just so slow that they always have a huge line . they always screw up something with the food too . i was spitting out uncooked rice last time i ate here .
mexican	their fajita beef tacos were very good . the rice and refried beans are tasteless . only in a college town could a place like this stay open . they need to change the name to " only eat the tacos ... "
mexican	the rice didn 't even cover the bottom of the bowl and i received about 6 squares of steak . really ! ?
mexican	not very fast service , and they rush you . i 'd rather go a few miles down the street to a different one then this one .
mexican	you get a decent amount for your money by splitting the big @ $ $ nachos or ordering the 3lb burger for a group of people instead of just one person . individual sized entrees are way overpriced and saying the food is mediocre is actually a compliment . save your money , and your gas , go to your local roberto 's or any mom and pop taco shop for much better and cheaper food . as for the 1 dollar taco and margaritas , either this is a limited thing they only offer during happy hour or it 's on a secret menu because none of the servers were talking about it and no where was it on the menu .
mexican	3 of the 6 sodas were out of order . they were also out of the carrots and two of the taco meats were gone too .
mexican	ordered table side guacamole $ 10.00 not with it ! my wife and i both ordered 3 tacos for $ 10.00 each carne asada tacos were bland tuff zero taste , shrimp taco and chorizo tacos were good but 3 bites and they were gone . so $ 45.00 after tip i left still hungry and disappointed , my recommendation would be go to lo lo 's chicken and waffles next door !
mexican	extremely overrated and overpriced . always crowded . small portions for high prices . the only thing they can vouch for is ' authentic mexican food ' but it 's hyped up too much . food is really sloppy and messy . instead of providing quality food for each customer , it feels as if they just make the food to get rid of their long line quicker . this is the kind of place that takes quantity over quality .
mexican	first time at this location on sunday around 6pm . i ordered a steak bowl like i normally do from chipotle . chicken can sometimes be dry , but how can they mess up steak ? unfortunately they managed to do it . i came home and the steak was chewy like it had been sitting there too long . sadly , this 'll be my last visit to this location . i 'll be driving to the one near casa paloma even though it 's further .
mexican	horrible tamales , beef taco and passable enchiladas and burritos . average beans and rice . i don 't get why this place is so popular ...
mexican	i don 't have an issue spending the money when the food is good . it is not here . not worth the money . cafe sevilla in san diego is worlds better . paella mixta and octopus appetizer less than mediocre . location nice but not the food . the stuffed dates , sangria and the dessert with ice cream was the best items we ate .
mexican	i got the lunch special which is a good amount of food for the price . but the food wasnt worth it . it wasn 't hot , barely even warm , the enchilada sauce was too thick , and i think they could try a little harder . i 'm back to going to rositas .
mexican	the food was lack lustre and so was the service .
mexican	i love fuzzy 's , used to go all the time when i lived in tx . i was so excited when it came out here but lately it 's been terrible . customer service is spotty at best . past few times the food has been made wrong and then the employees had attitude about making it right . i am bummed because l love the place but this location is ruining it , i probably won 't be back .
mexican	mesquite broiled tri tip sandwich is okay at best . won 't go back for food , but maybe drinks and live music .
mexican	i tried the chimichangas and they were okay at best . the rice was mushy and flavorless and the beans were mediocre . i also had a margarita that tasted like the store bought mix . i have had significantly better mexican food at other locations . it was also very smokey , like there was a fire in the kitchen . not sure i 'd that 's normal or not .
mexican	the employees taking the orders rush you along and mumble the order questions . at a minimum of three times i asked person preparing food to repeat what was said , with that being said i felt frustrated and ready to eat food and leave . management needs to train better . i have been to several chipoltes in other states , never seen one this disappointing . speak loud enough so customers can here your questions and that would help better experience .
mexican	trying o hard to be hip . the horrible artwork ruoins the mood . confused menu offers little in the way of authentic latin food . just another messy fusion place . get rid of the art make the food more authentic , get rid of the terrible sauces ( the pineapple sauce had turned the first time and i checked again second time and it still smelled ) and you have a nice place . as of now its latino food for people who hate latino food .
mexican	i 've eaten here 3 times and every time i 've experienced the same ; monotone employees and food not prepared .
mexican	i have to say that is nasty in & of itself . the table behind were regulars which meant that they continually paid attn to their drinks while ignoring us . i was excited for an alternative to open that was a bit more cas than cantina . tortilla flats was just a half step up from moe 's . unimpressed & uninspired by the burrito .
mexican	pro : clean and spacey , friendly staff , easy parking , very nice salsa bar with all the chips ( fresh ) and salsa you wish , dishes have quite large portions of pork and chicken in them as well as green pepper , their green chili sauce is very tasty . con : chicken has no flavor , somewhat dry , skimpy on the onions in the fajita burrito , all the sauces taste alike and none are hot , crispy taco just fell apart , was truly finger food . i would rate them 2 1 / 2 stars . obviously , we won 't be back !
mexican	the carne asada meat quality has gone down . grizzly meat and the taste is subpar . unfortunate because i really liked this place and its close to home . also the size of the burritos has shrunk for the same price .
mexican	looking over and seeing all the employees sitting down while my guest and i both needed water refills . made the guacamole table side , but didn 't offer any chips . my husband had to go to the bar and ask for more chips and water . no prebussing of any sort . corn cakes tasted like stale corn bread . the best part of the visit was the friendly manager that seated us and cashed us out .
mexican	mismanaged . understaffed and tables , soda station , floors , restrooms filthy . staff present during my visit did their best to keep up but to no avail . sodas , teas etc .. running out . phone rang off the hook ! !
mexican	normally things here are ok - nothing fantastic . yesterday , i ordered carryout chipotle yucatan salad for lunch . the menu said the salad included cilantro and avocado . the salad was pretty small compared to what i have gotten in the restaurant in the past . i got exactly 3 tiny chunks of avocado and zero cilantro . for $ 10 , i expected a bigger salad and it should have plenty of ingredients . in addition , it was a hot mess . looked like it was originally put into the ' dine in restaurant ' bowl and someone realized it was carryout and then just scraped it into the styrofoam box .
mexican	not as good as i had hoped . " met friends for drinks and dinner . the positive : the frozen strawberry margarita was delicious ! ! ! they have one night during the week where margaritas are $ 5 . had the cheese dip which was not good . not sure how you can mess up cheese dip but they did somehow . they do have a nice patio area . we decided to go elsewhere for dinner .
mexican	not that it was bad , but i could have made this food . no real wow factor , and given the neighborhood , they really need one to survive long term . the place just came off as mediocre .
mexican	not the usual chipotle experience . food did not taste fresh . place was not clean . on the plus side , it wasn 't crowded .
mexican	ordered the classic tacos and received a tortilla with steak . no toppings at all .
mexican	poor quality of food . awful meat for the tacos . churros stale ... did not taste anything. like real churros .
mexican	poor service and food was not very good . flavorless and overpriced . came highly recommended as authentic mexican food but i have had better at a taco truck for far less money .
mexican	quality of food has gone down . entrees were lacking in rice and beans . had to search them out . the flank steak was luke warm . tostado de tinga-chicken was dry huaraches-steak not too tender . toto pas-more than enough chips , where 's the rice , beans , pico de galo , and guacamole btw service was very good .
mexican	service was disorganized and slow . they said they were out of taco shells and queso . how is that possible . one in our group did not get her food until most of us were done . food was decent .... pretty fresh . probably won 't go back .
mexican	small portion for the money . tortillas were hard and cold . and our server was too busy flirting with 60 something old ladies . he didn 't even offer to refill my soda . i even had to go find him to pay . 1 star is for the ok food . service would get a zero
mexican	terrible food . food was old probably prepared days before , the rice and tortillas were hard .
mexican	the screwed up part is they called me a liar . thank you robertos on bermuda and pyle .
mexican	if you are going to celebrate national burrito day make sure your inventory is up to par please .
mexican	the only good food i had here was the friendly service and chips and salsa . but if you are looking for a good sized meal , then this is the place for you . big portions , and busy during lunch time
mexican	the decor is beautiful but the food is bland . disconnected service . parking is a nightmare ! the manager is very sweet and tried to correct everything from mistakes on our order to mistakes on our bill but the food isn 't good enough to return .
mexican	the food is ok but overpriced $ 11 for three small fajita tacos no sides and they charged extra for some cilantro and cheese . food was ok not memorable and certainly not worth the $ paid . won 't be back
mexican	the only drinks they had were beer an margaritas . although the menu said red and white wine . we had to ask for a menu because they forgot to bring us one . beware the chicken quesadilla it was inedible the cheese inside look like kraft cheese squares . the waiter was great an very apologetic . the carne asada burrito was apparently good .
mexican	the service was really good , and i like the layout of the new restaurant . but the food and flies were terrible ! how can you mess up tortilla soup ? i don 't get it ? it tasted like re fried beans and dog food . my husband ordered the guac with bacon and a shot rib taco . he didn 't eat either . they put pickled beats on everything , tastes just like kimchi . i really wanted to like the new location , but they need a new cook / chef . don 't waste your money ( or calories ) , go to frank and lupes right down the street !
mexican	the tortilla soup came out room temperature , so it was microwaved and brought back . seafood enchiladas were cool but a bit warmer than room temp . chili relleno was good but had a cold sauce . i do not trust the cook . he will cause someone to get seriously ill .
mexican	they have a menu with combo prices but yet charges you individual prices . a 8.50 combo turned out to be 11 bucks . how does that happen . lady in the drive thru said everything is individual pricing not combo pricing . whatever . she didn 't speak english anyway . ridiculous .
mexican	they were out of diet coke and carnitas . the guacamole was tasteless as was the salsa . service was also slow . we will not return .
mexican	this places used to be a fantastic place but not anymore . i used to come to enjoy barbacoa and tacos on the weekend and really enjoying it . however , the last times i came during weekdays the food was terrible . all heated in the microwave , tasteless , in general a bad food experience . customer service is great but i wont be coming back ...
mexican	this place used to be a great value for the price , i used to get a 3 tamale combo for 5.49 , as of november 1st it is now 7.49 for a 2 tamale combo ... the place is not in the nicest of neighborhoods , always some sort of questionable individual out front , but i didn 't mind , good food , good value . however now with the 2 dollar increase with less food , i wont waste my time , i can find a better value without being subjected to meth heads .
mexican	we added cheese to each of our tacos and they charged us $ 1 per ( to be expected ) , but only 1 taco had the cheese on it . additionally , it appeared that some of the other toppings that each taco comes with ( according to the menu ) , were scarce or missing . maybe this was an off night ? it was after 9 pm during the week and they weren 't that busy . don 't rule them out , but i don 't think we 'll go back now that we 're not located near by . the shrimp guac is still excellent and must try .
mexican	i 'm not sure how it happened when there were six people working and i was the only customer ! this location is the same distance as the one on rainbow so that 's where i 'll be going from now on .
mexican	i paid $ 7.65 for a dry arepa that totally fell apart . for this price i could have gone somewhere else for a lot more food . i think the price is high for an arepa and no sides or chips . wasn 't even offered any sauces . guess that is my fault .
mexican	tried the seasoned ground beef burrito . $ 1.50 extra for sour cream . tasted like a 7-eleven microwave burrito . it was 60 % refried beans , 20 % rice , 15 % beef , 5 % sour cream . $ 12 wasted ! ! ! ! 1 star because you can 't give zero ! ! ! ! !
mexican	i ordered a pollo asado burrito and what i got was still raw . the chicken was still pink in the middle ! i really don 't plan on returning ever .
mexican	unfortunately , it 's not the first time that we get served raw chicken at this location . last month , i brought up to the manager and i did again today . both managers told me their chicken is cooked to the required temperature . unfortunately , i don 't agree .
mexican	whoever owns the place better make changes before they 're out of business . ordered what i thought would be " super nachos " paid $ 7 for liquid cheese . if this place is authentic mexican so is 7-11 . going back to robertos where they have the decency to serve shredded cheese .
mexican	chili poblanos are gone . ordered chilaquiles mexicanos and it was very bland , as was my son 's dish . seems like lios aztecas is trying to amercanize rather than be authentic .
mexican	they charge extra for guacamole . very small tacos . i would not recommend .
mexican	my boyfriend 's had a pretty decent amount of meat but he was only impressed with " the standard . " shrimp taco had some good taste to it and had a solid three shrimp .
mexican	the quesadilla was bland , as was the guacamole ( which seemed to be nothing more than chopped up vegetables ) . i ended up taking the guac home and flavoring it myself . their salsa and queso was decent but nothing special .
mexican	extremely understaffed for a saturday night- took 30 minutes to get our order taken and then another 40 to get our food . warning : if you like good chips and tacos this is not the place . chips and tortillas are overcooked and stiff making it difficult to chew . simply , yuck ! table side made guacamole was lumpy , tasteless , and unappetizing . will definitely not be back unfortunately
mexican	for it being a mexican restaurant this food was horrible . chips and salsa was gross . paste is better . ordered green chicken enchiladas and i got rolled enchiladas with cubed chicken that looked like fajita chicken .
mexican	food was mediocre , lacked flavor and a bit dry ... ( chicken quesadilla , mahi-mahi tacos , fajitas ) . i prefer authentic mexican food ... leticia 's in northwest . i expected more from laredo cantina ... we weren 't greeted with a smile , the server didn 't refill our drinks , we had to wave him down a few times . the prices were decent however the portions were very small . i highly recommend for you to go elsewhere . cafe rio or leticia 's ... oooh yeah !
mexican	they just opened so maybe working out the kinks . will give them another shot
mexican	the employees are very skimpy with portions . if i 'm going to pay you for a bowl , you should give me enough to fill the bowl ! i understand that the employees are probably concerned about running out of food . this falls now on the cooks and management . make more food to serve your paying customers and keep portion size consistent . if i wanted a kids meal i would have ordered one . another thing , i got a bowl recently and it had hard pieces of idk what in it ! ! not cool or ok ! ! ! !
mexican	you 're out of brown rice , the place wasn 't that busy , i asked for no juice from your pico de gallo but she does the opposite , cashier doesn 't even say hi , doesn 't give me a tray , i have to ask for it and ask for my cups for drinks , doesn 't say thank you . it was 6pm , your place is so dirty , overflowing trash , dirty tables . terrible service from this restaurant . the guacamole was very bland , we didn 't even finish it . not eating again at this location .
mexican	we we had a bad experience then and one again today . we knew we didn 't want to dine in so we placed a pick up order . when we got to the restaurant we were treated very rudely by the female cooking . once we got our order home , the food was okay . the burritos had little to almost no meet , and the enchiladas were overloaded with onions . i 'm not sure if there has been a change in ownership but it 's defiantly not the place i used to hear so much about .
mexican	after reading the positive reviews , we gave vida a try for dinner . i agree with another reviewer that it was subpar . better choices are out there
mexican	i tried to order to go and they told me they didn 't do that ; then someone else got on the line and took my order to go , but they didn 't start the order until i showed up at the restaurant--there goes 20 minutes of my day , for no reason . oh , then they didn 't give me any salsa or cutlery for my to go order . awesome , thanks . to top it off , the food was mediocre at best . mole tamale was funky and the tacos were average . i 'd say stay away .
mexican	better mexican food around . the food was kind of bland and lacked flavor
mexican	disappointing ... bought the most expensive meal on the menu which is ceviche but not worth my $ 35 ... i 'm not going there again ... to be fair , i 'll give them credit for the delicious yuca roll and the ambience
mexican	came for the homemade tortillas and they had run out . what good mexican restaurant runs out of homemade tortillas ? ! ? actually , a good mexican restaurant only serves homemade tortillas . the carnitas burrito was mediocre and had to wait more than once to get our water glasses refilled . wouldn 't waste my money here again ... it wasn 't cheap and it was very average food .
mexican	i ordered the breakfast sandwich to go . although it 's advertised as being served with chorizo , i barely found more than a few chunks ... 1-2 ounces at most . the cheese was a poor attempt at being " melted . " the bread was extremely chewy , like i had to use some strength to pull it apart with my teeth . the scrambled eggs and pico were the only redeeming components , but at $ 13.00 they were hardly worth it . obviously the high standards that are applied at her other restaurants are not even a consideration at the airport location . such a shame .
mexican	the kitchen messed up both of our custom guac orders , which isn 't the end of the world however the waitstaffs attempt to make it right was to take one of them back to the kitchen and have them add the missing ingredient after we had already started eating it ... just didn 't feel like we got " taken care of ... " maybe it was an off night for them
mexican	after we were seated , it took 11 minutes for the waiter to take our order . as i was ordering my food , i noticed that the heavy-set man also happened to be sagging exposing his briefs . not very appetizing . the fajitas were simple with a low quality meat . the fiesta platter was literally thrown together and not appetizing . the salsa was the only thing good . this place has promise , but given the number of stars on yelp , it 's time for the owners to fire the manager before it 's too late . if only jon taffer rescued restaurants ....
mexican	the mini tacos were surprisingly pretty flavorless and not fresh . the tortillas were chewy / hard ? and it was work to get through each taco. my fish tacos were supposed to come wih a creme sauce but there was no sauce and the tacos ended up being very dry because of that . my mans tacos came w rice and beans and lines but mine didn 't and it took forever to get those ! i 'm hoping this was just a fluke but we left feeling bad that we actually paid money for that meal .
mexican	the ceviche ( $ 10 ) does not come with raw fish cooked with the acids of a fresh lemon , but rather it is canned , cooked fish sitting in bottled lemon juice . the duck taquitos were dry , like frozen ones that were microwaved a little too long . ( and they still sold for around $ 10 for two taquitos . ) and the seafood in the paella ( $ 21 ) was overcooked , and in a sauce that tasted a lot like chef boyardee sauce . my colleagues enjoyed the fish filet dishes , though , so perhaps it may be best to just avoid the dishes mentioned above . besides that , friendly service and a good beer selection .
mexican	tacos arrived in cold to lukewarm tortillas . one had a beautiful piece of fish with unremarkable toppings . considerably more expensive than other mexican options : ta chido , el rey del taco , la matraca . convivial atmosphere and stylish hipster wait staff .
mexican	had roasted pork in a nondescript red sauce for ca . $ 16 . wasn 't impressed . my dining partner thought their entrée was so-so . good guacamole & margaritas , but won 't be returning .
mexican	has the potential to be great but i 've definitely had better . will find another mexican food joint near my office : /
mexican	i am a huge advocate for chipotle , and i have eaten at this one on a number of occasions , but my recent experience was not as good . unfortunately , the person designated at the grill blackened the chicken to the point of no return . it was devastating . before leaving i actually had the chance to take a look at the grill , and he was ferociously burning all of the chicken ! ! who is supervising this dude ? does he not realize that he is ruining countless $ 10 burritos ? sad face .
mexican	i like the idea behind this chain ( fresh ingredients , naturally raised meat ) , but was expecting slightly more for the price . i ordered the carnitas fajita burrito . the rice was great and the salsa tasted fresh , however the peppers and onions were undercooked to the point they were still crispy and the onions so hot , i could still taste them an hour later . maybe my experience was an exception , but i won 't be in a hurry to try it again .
mexican	i love cuban food , so i really wanted to like this place . overpriced , small portions , and surprisingly bland . we order the empanada appetizer and received 1 small / medium sized empanada . it actually was good , but i was left wanting more . a piece of havana gives you 4 empanadas with their appetizer and three different flavors . we split the cuban sandwich and roast pork entree . sandwich was good . pork was bland and small portioned . the plantains that i had with it were good . congri was fine ... nothing special . i would recommend going to a piece of havanna . more food and more flavor .
mexican	inconsistent slow ( but pretty nice ) service , waitress seemed to be waiting on the entire restaurant . my margarita was all sugar and minimal tequila and 10-12 bucks from memory ( which i have no problem paying for a good stiff drink ) . my wife and i both had meat in our dishes ( beef and pork ) and it was chewy and unpleasant . we live right across the street and were really hoping this place would be good , unfortunately .....
mexican	i should 've left as soon as i saw the old dried up crusty beans , but i decided to give it a try without the beans & i love beans . : ( the chicken burrito was not the business & the guacamole was so bland . i will never return to this place .
mexican	i tried the omg tacos . omg , they had no taste ! the meat was tough and unseasoned , and why were there two shells for each taco ? maybe because they were mushy and fell apart easily . yet i will give them another chance with a different menu item . perhaps they were having an off day .
mexican	i 've been to lots of taquerias in mexico , st. louis and california , and this one was way below average . as much as i like authentic mexican food , i 'd prefer a big chain over this place . not recommended .
mexican	i 've enjoyed the henderson location most . the e. desert inn location is also off . but the w. flamingo is just " not great . " the taco salad at lunch today was the worst in memory - no flavor - simply thrown together . cabbage to fill the lettuce . not much tomato . not a spec of cilantro or onion . the chicken was gawd awful . service staff was working hard , but without good effect . from henderson , i got the impression this group was run by a nice family and had their management chops down . i 'm afraid not . alternatives abound .
mexican	it took 40 minutes to receive my shrimp burrito . waitress said they were busy ; there were 13 customers in the restaurant ( including me ) . the burrito was 85 percent sloppy rice and was served fully wrapped in paper , cut in half , and plopped down on a plate . no rice , no beans , no condiments , etc . tasted ok . don 't go , if you are in a hurry or wanting a semi nice sit down lunch experience .
mexican	disappointingly , after a short dm back and forth with lindsey ( dir of marketing ) over a month ago about wanting to reach out to me , i have not heard from the area supervisor , will .
mexican	food fairly bland . best things were tortillas and skinny margarita . glad i had coupon and saved some money ! would not go there again ! !
mexican	you walk in the door and your standing between right beside tables in a line of people looking a menus because you have to order for all 8 of your group before sitting down . chips and queso are extra ... because they are made fresh i 'm told . we got our order and all three of my chicken items had very little taste . we asked for some salsa hoping it would add some flavor and guess what ? that 's another 5 $ .... because because it 's made fresh so they have to charge . this is not at all worth the time , there are much better options around .
mexican	no " burrito bowl " type option either . if you get one of their sodas to go , be sure to have your own bottle opener as they 're not twist offs . i doubt it will be open after the summer ends .
mexican	not worth the $ . way overpriced and not tasty enough for the amount you get .
mexican	... once was our favorite mexican food in pittsburgh . ... now not so much .... had caluzedos for two ... 70 % beef , that was ... very few shrimp ... to top it off with a near empty restaurant the service was lacking ....
mexican	the " amazing guacamole " wasn 't very exciting at all , and it was $ 14 . i could mash up one avocado at home for a similar experience . maybe i 'm too used to real mexican food but this place did nothing to me . and there is no excuse to order an appetizer and entree and leave hungry . never again . it had a beautiful ambiance , nice decor , i 'll give it that .
mexican	red salsa tasted like refrigerator . i asked for 3 veggie tacos with just potatoes , pico , and lettuce , and they put like 10 french fries in each taco . smh ... if someone asks you if you have potatoes and all you haves is fries , you say no . green salsa was decent . almost 9 dollars for these frie tacos and they don 't even have ketchup .
mexican	seems to cater to skinny always-starving scottsdale girls . went for lunch , got a snack . ordered the tacos , got little , tiny disks of corn tortillas with just a few strips of meat . stay away if you are hungry .
mexican	service sucked and it was very unorganized my wait for just a chicken quesadilla took 30 mins there was no line people were just pushing around i do not recommend going there . should of just gone to the taco bell down the street from my house .
mexican	with guy 's name on the door i expected much more " flavortown . " won 't be back .
mexican	the chips served were warm and glistened of oil . three types of salsa were very good . i ordered beef tacos and rice . i had the option of ordering shredded beef for $ 1.25 more , but i was cheap and went with the ground beef . big mistake ... the grease actually dripped from the tacos . we ordered a small cheese crisp which was not fully cooked . the green chili burro was ordinary . the re-fried beans and rice were very tasty . the atmosphere is vintage and seemed like it needed a good cleaning . i didn 't check the restrooms .
mexican	the fish tacos have been cooked to the point that the fish was hard . last visit we had one over cooked fish taco but the others were ok . i hope it 's not going down hill
mexican	mediocre ( cold ) chips and salsa . good margarita ( i upgraded to milagro tequila ) . i asked my waitress what she recommended ( beef fajitas ) and tried everything on the plate , but i will not be bringing the leftovers ( lots ! ) home . they can put in the garbage or " re-gift " ! ! ! i don 't understand how / why this place has so many great reviews .... no atmosphere , run-of-the-mill mexican food , average service . will not be returning ... too many really good mexican food restaurants in the valley .
mexican	turned away without even trying after driving 25 minutes to try for the 1st time . it 's 9 : 15 , sign says close at 10p . " we decided to close early today " # falseadvertising
mexican	granted we went at 12 midnight , completely sober , mind you , that shouldnt mean customers of that hour should get jipped . we ordered a steak quesadilla , 1 hard 1 soft taco , and a 7 layer burrito . all were jipped on fillings ! the tacos had maybe a half inch of combined fillings , the 7 layer burrito has definitely shrunk in size and filling is just as poor . the only great thing about it was the nice drive through gal and the plentiful amount of sauces they gave us ! love the verde ! !
mexican	) always clean , never busy , friendly staff .
mexican	waitress took 15 minutes before i flagged them down . they took my order but no follow up and waiting another 10 minutes to get my check . i had the chicken nachos which were average . did not like my drink the sergio . was way heavy on the tequila and not refreshing and light which is what i was hoping with the fruit juice and mint .
mexican	walked in around 2pm for a late lunch and drinks on a saturday . no one was working the bar . the food was ok . not great . i thought it was expensive too compared to other mexican places in the area . and an extra $ 1.50 for using a credit card ? probably won 't come back . and never got my drink .
mexican	the menu is very similar to most other mexican restaurants in madison , the prices were higher . no big deal , if the food is great , that 's not a game changer . the food had cold spots in it , the orders came incorrectly , nobody came to check on us and make sure things were okay . i could understand if the restaurant was busy , but it wasn 't . that 's just not right . there are enough alternatives in the area , we 'll go there instead .
mexican	we used to come here once a week . they changed he red chili recipe and the beans taste like they are out of a can . you used to be great ! stop cutting corners .
mexican	while authentic salvadorian food , this place does not provide any unique flavors , taste or even good quality food . tamales are fried instead of boiled and have a weird aftertaste of old food ( definitely not what you 'd expect from fresh elote ) . pupusas while filled generously are way too thick and the dough is not fully cooked . way too oily . perhaps because the pan wasn 't hot enough . service was lazy despite the fact there were only 2 customers in the restaurant . not recommended .
mexican	as we were ordering the cooks obviously we 're talking bad about us , i don 't speak spanish so they continued to talk with each other and then looking at us and laughing . the food was burnt , corn on the cob had black parts in it , all of it didn 't taste good . the cashier roller her eyes because i told her there was a spill on the floor . the music is very loud , difficult to even speak . over priced , and a waste of $ 30 on 7 small tacos , 2 burnt tostada and bad corn on the cob ... i don 't recommend this place to eat !
mexican	the kitchen was backed up , which happens , but unfortunately the food was not worth the wait . the fajitas had no flavor and we got refried beans when we had asked for black beans , but we had waited so long we didn 't send anything back . i gave 2 stars because the tortilla soup was pretty good and maybe it would have been better if they weren 't having kitchen issues . we got quite a few apologies throughout the evening , but no visit from the manager , dessert or reduced bill - we didn 't request any of these things , but other restaurants have offered after less disappointing experiences . we 'll stick to rio rico for mexican food !
mexican	staff rude , food bland , salsa tastes like tomato water . only neat thing here is the mexican drinks on tap . extremely disappointing .
mexican	i understand they would like me to order 5-6 items , but i have no desire to spend anything over $ 50 for lunch . the sangria was the only morsel of hope for me to ever return . having all the potential in the world , they could make this place fantastic . considering my guest and i were the only ones eating in the middle of lunch hour i am positive that we are not the only ones who feel this way .
mexican	tongue taco and a mixto . zero flavor . salsa . zero flavor . beans . zero flavor . they get 1 star for clean bathroom .
mexican	7 of us ate here , all concur that the food is very salty ! im appaled !
mexican	i had heard mixed reviews and opted to try it . lack of flavor .... added some salt to get some of it down ... hey i was hungry with no other option at that point and it was my lunch break ! enchiladas were a bit more greasy than expected - rice and beans had really no flavor . menu is basic mexican food . lots of bar type appetizer options . others who ordered with me said fish tacos are great , quesadillas were basic . probably won 't return .
mexican	discussing food , lazy service .. they wanted to serve food that was really old go elsewhere.the tortillas are not homemade
mexican	hard tamales covered in a gross green sauce which made the outside gummy . rice was horrible .
mexican	chili relleno was horrid . one of the buss boys brought me soup and spilled it everywhere then dropped all the churros for the party seated behind mine . he must 've been under the influence of something , most likely stoned . my waiter was filling my beverage and it seemed like he got more on the table and my seat rather than my cup . wouldn 't recommend this establishment to my worst enemy . 1 / 5
mexican	i was sadly disappointed . maybe you 'll be more fortunate if you come at a different time . i showed up for happy hour on a tuesday at 3pm . the food was decent but not good enough to overshadow the unhappy , unfriendly server .
mexican	normally i love cafe rio , but this team is unmotivated and miserable . they aren 't happy to be there , and even more unhappy that i showed up to order a burrito . back when they first opened , i was excited to finally have a cafe rio near my house . and now i 'm so sad , because the employees ruin the experience with their attitude .
mexican	stopped in for lunch with my mom and my daughter , who has muscular dystrophy and is in a wheelchair . we probably would have spent $ 20 . my daughter was thirsty so we asked for a cup of water but needed one with a lid so she didn 't spill it . they wanted to charge us .29 for the cup ! we told them that it was for my daughter , explaining why we needed a lid . the response was " sorry that 's our policy " so we went next door to rubios , who had no concern with grasping the concept of why we needed a lid . over a stupid cup .
mexican	a huge sewer roach was found inside the burrito wrapping . not a regular roach a huge sewer roach . how does that happen ! ! health hazard . making me sick just thinking about it .
mexican	i got a combination plate enchilada ( one shrimp and one chicken ) . the enchilada was a soggy mess ! the beans were so old looking and dark brown . the taste was even worse . i had one bite and wanted to throw up . i didn 't eat anymore of it and tossed it soon after .
mexican	and over priced , even for las vegas . $ 16 for a tiny meatless quesadilla with some nasty sauce and sour cream guac , and a small fountain drink . makes taco bell look like a fine dining establishment .
mexican	the last couple times i 've been there . food is cold . staff is rude .
mexican	disgusting bad service roll was falling apart there was only 2 tables with people and it took long time just to bring the beverages and food i dont recommend it to anyone .
mexican	do not come here . i promise you. really disappointed . go to the pizza place next door for cheaper , cleaner , healthier food .
mexican	disgusting food , got food poisoning on my birthday from eating the arizona burrito here yesterday .
mexican	high fructose corn syrup and gmo in everything . and they charge 20 bucks . i felt so sick and threw up after i had breakfast there . the service was terrible , our waiter disappeared , no one speaks english , depressing atmosphere , i will never go there again !
mexican	tastes like frozen food that was reheated .. only thing good were the chips . will not return !
mexican	ghetto . rude . those are the nicest things i can say about this hell hole . like everyone else i only come here because of the drive thru ( which usually takes about 20 full minutes to get through and that 's with no line ) . the employees there are clearly depressed and could care less ( which isn 't really their fault . they make 8 dollars an hour . ) just awful . avoid it at all cost . it 's gross clearly never cleaned and they don 't care about their customers at all . go 2 miles up the road there 's another one , it 's also 24 hours . clean and friendly . trust me .
mexican	grilled fish taco looked like cat food and didn 't taste any better . took 2 bites and threw away .
mexican	honestly , who makes sweet cheese enchiladas ? i took three bites and threw the rest away . authentic ? i think not . i will keep searching for the best mexican food in town until i find it ...
mexican	disgusting horrible the furthest from real tacos the waitress this little cutie was a stupid as could be i asked for corn tortillas fish tacos cost us more i said ok she came back with crappie smelly flour tortillas then tried to convince me they were white corn uh duh i 'm not some dumb redneck who thinks taco bell is gastronomy exotica it was a pitstop on a very long drive from nyc to atlanta yikes don 't stop here unless you like rat taco
mexican	i feel like throwing up . i am never eating at any roberto 's taco shop again . my husband ordered me a carne asada nacho about half an hour ago ( to-go ) .... ate it and on the bottom i found a fried " tie knot closure " that belongs on a plastic packing bag . are you kidding me ? i will be contacting the clark county health district . how unsanitary is that place or their workers ? if i could i would leave no stars . it doesn 't matter if you 're busy and it 's chicken taco wednesday . this should never be in anyone 's food . date : 1 / 6 / 2016 @ 9 : 44 pm .
mexican	if it were possible to give this location a negative star rating , i would ! avoid at all costs ! i went in to pick up an order and no one greeted me for over five minutes while i waited at the register , when i finally was greeted , the cashier had the nerve to get an attitude and act as though i was disturbing her . to top it all off , not only did they completely screw up my order , there was a hair in my food !
mexican	if i wanted reheated food i would have got a tv dinner for cheaper . my beans were burnt around the edges and you couldn 't pick up the bowl it was so hot . also our " waiter " waited on us twice to take our order and get payment . we waited 15min for him just to bring the check .
mexican	but please burger king on charleston and decatur check all your food and quality
mexican	i hardly ever write reviews but this place was horrible ! we start off with drink a margarita that tasted like soap and was loaded with sugar , my boyfriend had a warm modelo . slightly turned off we opted to only order appetizers hoping the food would be better .. boy were we wrong .. the $ 6 chips and salsa were gross the salsa tasted like tomato paste and the chips were stale . we also had the charlie 's quesadilla , which is suppose to have 3 meats in it but was instead overfilled with cheese and was ice cold .... do not eat here ! ! ! ! save yourself
mexican	i like cheap mexican food ( amados , carolinas etc ) . beans are like baby food . rice is mushy and pasty . tacos have three times as much wilted lettuce as dried meat . nasty . ive tried it three times now . breakfast burrito pours grease out the bottom even with a wrapper .
mexican	i 'm going to try to upload a picture of the " lettuce " that was in my salad . i 've been to this location twice , both times ordering a salad . the first time , there were a few pieces of lettuce that looked old , but i thought maybe it was an off day so i tried again today . big mistake . i get to the bottom of the salad , and the lettuce is so old it 's black and gooey ! i will post an update if i actually get sick from this . gross .
mexican	i ordered the carne asada fries and buried deep within hair inside the food . just gross ! walked right back in n showed it to them . poor service , poor food quality . lost my support
mexican	the guacamole looks like snot . it was a waste of 25 dollars . never again will i step foot into papa chevo 's .
mexican	it was gross . they were rude ! ! & tried to make my husband pay $ 25 more because we are from ny & because conservation fee for the water . ( we pointed it out & they took it off ) i got terribly sick the next day ! & we were on our honeymoon please i 'm begging you don 't go there . & the sangria is not sangria its juice has no alcohol in it ! ! ! !
mexican	it was our first afternoon in vegas and we were told this restaurant was good . it wasn 't . first off you have to pay for chips and salsa and maybe i expect it to be free cause i 'm from california . either way the chips were stale . my wife 's enchiladas had no flavor . my burrito was no better . when we left the restaurant we were both feeling sick , no one threw up but we didn 't feel well the rest of the night . don 't waste your time coming here , vegas has so many other places to choose from
mexican	just found a spider in my quesadilla , i called and complained and was treated like i was lying . i was told to bring the food back because the cook stated that it couldnt be possible. my goal was to take it back no matter what a get a refund ! not very professional to tell the consumer they are lying !
mexican	long wait , dirty drive through window . the worker opened the window covered in a dust like powder with dirty hands . we didn 't even get our food we were so disgusted . don 't eat here ever ! ! manager must not care how his place is managed . gross ! ! !
mexican	seriously ! i felt like i was going to get some sort of disease just by walking in to pay . it 's that dirty ! people who work there are rude , too . avoid !
mexican	every table was dirty . i saw one food preparer sneeze into her hand , then continued to prepare food without washing her hands .
mexican	olivia was very rude and didn 't get my whole order right . not that hard to put cheese on the side . the food was horrible as well . very nasty meat . this place needs new management or management who can address the problems and new employees who can take orders correctly
mexican	over priced . go to the mexican restaurant behind the hotel . $ 8 for a bland burrito with extremely dry rice . salsas all taste the same .
mexican	second time i ordered takeout at this restaurant , again my order was wrong . no flavor in the food .... use a lot of red sauce to give flavor . i 'm a brunette and found blond hair in my food , made me sick !
mexican	nothing had any flavor , the carne asada meat might as well have been boiled , it was chewy and gross , the tortillas are huge and tough , and nothing had any flavor . tossed 75 % of it on the trash 30 seconds ago and my stomach is already upset from the few bites i did eat . if this is the best mexican food in henderson , don 't go to henderson for mexican food . this was atrocious . never going back .
mexican	ordered guacamole & chips , though the guacamole was green that was the only resemblance , flavor was horrible . pork for the taco was similar to the consistency of baby food but flavor was so bad my boyfriend actually gagged when he tasted it . food was cold , not even room temperature . will not go back ! no stars are warranted for this place .
mexican	$ 16 for a tiny crap " burrito " with super dry beef , soggy gas station quality tortilla , minimal toppings , and salsa that was clearly from a can . ripoff .
mexican	can 't begin to describe how gross this place is . to top off the horrendous food , a staff member was vomiting violently while we were eating- no doubt due to having eaten at this hell hole should 've asked for my money back i 'm sure you would have a better meal out of a dumpster
mexican	disgusting place to eat , costumer service is the worse , went with my friends to have some tacos and in all 3 orders we found hair , i brought it to their attention and they just said thanks for coming and didn 't even apologize .
mexican	then the manager said to make sure i told the cashier the right items i told her i did it isn 't my fault she isn 't putting down what i 'm asking for smh . worst service ever .
mexican	smelly . dirty . shady . shall i keep going ? but i needed a diet coke and every other establishment in vegas has pepsi . the lid dispensers are beyond grimy and i had to walk out . this is the location across the mandalay bay .
mexican	so disappointed . rocky point shrimp salad is ice berg lettuce , mini shrimp , awful tomatoes , mushy cheese in a taco shell for 15 bux . guacamole was flavorless . bartender full blast blender during national anthem .. whole bar was respectfully listening and watching while the blender stole the show . so sad .. so close to home .. won 't be back .
mexican	for some reason , they wrap them in tin foil , which sticks to the soggy tortillas and makes it very hard to unwrap them intact . way too much sauce , which spills all over the damn place . the " meat " ( beef in this case ) barely tasted like meat . walk a few more minutes up to chipotle ( by way of lower simcoe , up to front ) for a much higher-quality product .
mexican	anytime you see teenagers working alone leave asap . they took my order , but the dumb cook didn 't listen . the breakfast burrito is possibly the worst version in america . some kind of goopy cheese , undercooked eggs and nothing else in this nasty waste of 4 bucks .
mexican	tasted like dog food . waiter was definitely on something . and he stunk . gross . will never , ever eat there again !
mexican	the food was just ok , the service was abysmal . i ended up getting gum on my pants and the owner came over and said " sorry , happens all the time . " she didn 't comp our meal or offer anything other than ice . when i tried to clean my pants she berated me telling me i 'm doing it incorrectly and that she wasn 't paying for my pants even though i never asked her to do that . if you eat here check underneath your table for gum .
mexican	it 's an overpriced taco bell . this was topped off by loud pre teen pop music !
mexican	it was supposed to be a vegetarian burrito . i called to complain , and the teenage manager that i spoke to sounded like she was laughing . no wonder this place frequently breaks out with e coli ... they must be sweeping the junk on the counter into the food storage . so disappointing .... not including that , the burritos were nasty - overstuffed with some ingredients , barely had others , and overall it was so stuffed that it had already ripped apart before taking a bite .
mexican	went at 10pm and every table and floor leading to registers dirty . ordered food to go to eat at the hotel and after taking a bite of a few different items we knew this was the worst mexican food we have ever had . threw the food out and had to order a pizza . wasted $ 20 ..
mexican	what a nasty mcdonalds ! the bathrooms were filthy with no toilet paper . waited a ridiculously long time for a jalapeno double burger which was so gross i threw the majority of it in the trash . it was cold and the slice of processed cheese they slopped on there was not even close to melted . yuck ! yuck ! yuck !
mexican	with the rudest staff . avoid this location at all costs . its almost as though they dont care about the food
mexican	worst enchiladas i 've had in my life . dry meat dry corn tortillas with a big thick layer of coagulated cheese on top . i 've had better refried beans out of a can and you don 't even get chips and salsa for the price . just more overpriced las vegas strip crap . margaritas we 're very average and they don 't use real juice for mix . avoid this place like the plague unless you 're just there to burn money and get drunk
mexican	would not ever eat here again . the place was filthy . ordered fries and chicken fries . both were cold and withered . the employee seemed annoyed i was ordering food and actually rolled her eyes at me when i asked for an extra packet of mayo . health dept. should pay a visit . took 2 bites and dumped it all in the trash .
mexican	yes it is true , the owner has tried to rip me off twice ! first time i gave him the benefit of the doubt but it is becoming increasingly obvious . and i saw 2 rats ! ! ! disgusting ! ! ! avoid if you value cleanliness and if you dont want to be ripped off !
mexican	you should be ashamed . used to love this place . until today , my niece ordered a margarita after a few sips she noticed there was a hair in it . before sending it back we purposely loaded it with salt . waitress brought her a " new " margarita , but yup you guessed it , the top was filled with fresh mix while all else was the same salty one we sent back ( that we purposely salted ) . shame on you ! ! ! busted !
mexican	this place is terrible . i left a pair of $ 150 oakley 's here during the day . i called an hour later and they said they found them . by the time i made it down there to pick them up they were gone , despite being stored where only employees have access . i sent numerous complaints to corporate and to the manager . corporate completely ignored me . the manager said he would ask the employees but never would respond back to me . they didn 't even offer to pay for the sunglasses their employees stole . not an offer for free food . terrible , dishonest business .
mexican	the mahi-mahi was overcooked . the chipotle glaze was unnecessary . price : mid-teens they charged us dinner prices for a 1 pm lunch . service : slow it was about an hour for the food to be delivered . the staff was polite though . verdict : not a good place for dining i won 't eat there again , but i may go for drinks after work if i 'm feeling tequila . at least the kitchen wouldn 't be able to mess that up .
mexican	the cashier obviously didn 't want my business since she motioned another patron to cut in front of me . they also forgot to make my friend 's order . i miss the days of dr. laffa . i 'll take my laffa cravings somewhere else that actually wants my patronage , sorry i offended you by trying to be your customer .
mexican	ordered a cadillac margarita with an extra shot of grand marnier , got an extra shot of tequila . all on all , a disappointing experience !
mexican	i 've been a regular customer for about 4 years and the food is not the same . the chicken is salty and no flavor . it looks like the recipes changed . not going back . not worth it .
mexican	server inattentive . asked if everything was ok so far ...... hadn 't even taken our order . skinny magarita disgustingly sweet .
mexican	the huevos rancheros were terribly skimpy : a little sauce on 3 small tortillas , egg , onion , and that 's all ; no rice , no beans , for $ 14 . slow service . would not recommend .
mexican	the food was bland and tasteless , service was slow and i had to ask 3 times for a refill on drinks
mexican	portions were small , prices high ( even for roncy ) and the food quality was mediocre . definitely ' canadianized ' cuban food . clearly taking advantage of a bunch of people who never had good cuban food before - or lived somewhere with a large cuban population.good wait staff , and the drinks were pretty good . left hungry though , even after an appetizer and an entree .
mexican	my husband and i along with friends decided we would try osteria 2350 on a friday night . it was open and airy , not too loud . we were able to be seated right away with our table overlooking the staff preparing the food . the waitress was friendly , serves was ok , and the food was fine , nothing special . what really stood out was one of the employees preparing the food behind the counter had a big swastika tattoo on his arm . hey , i believe you can have whatever tattoo you choose , but it 's probably not good for business to have your employees parading their neo-nazi believes in your customers face .
mexican	there is one female staff that 's always grumpy when taking ur order inside . definitely not impressed .
mexican	( not in a great way ) murals are odd-looking . taco 's were burnt - but that 's the way they do it . service - discombobulated . not just the new people . more women than men after work . loud !
mexican	i didn 't get sick or barf up a hariball . that 's the best i can say about this place
mexican	87.5 sanitation inspection ! yuck ! ! washing hands is a requirement everywhere
mexican	? ! i am moving to the peoria area from san diego and was looking forward to shopping here . something familiar to home . now i see they are all closed . why ?
mexican	carne asada tacos were flavorful probably won 't come back here . too many other good choices close by
mexican	the drinks were great and it was close to my gate but not paying someone else 's tab also lol
mexican	why support a restaurant that allows their employees to treat customers with such a bad attitude . gross .
mexican	does it still count as fast food if it take them 30 minutes to clear 3 cars through the drive-thru ?
mexican	food is good but i hate it when they don 't honor there own coupons .
mexican	does not provide air to paying customers also keep a metal baseball bat behind the counter when you get upset about asking
mexican	just went to the drive thru they said " just a second " waited 15 minutes and no one ever came back . this place is terrible .
mexican	terrible , terrible ! drinks , food , and service . i even had to go to the manager to ask if someone could wait on us .... we waited 10 minutes for someone to wait on us , but it wasn 't till i said something . then we got the food .... cardboard ... no cheese at all in anything . i can 't even explain .. i 'm from boston and we have pretty good mexican restaurants ..... compared to this ! ! very surprised that it 's crowded all the time ... maybe because people out here don 't know any better or nothing convenient to the area .
mexican	doesn 't matter if the drive thru screen is correct & you 're the only one there , they 'll still screw up your order .
mexican	this will be my last visit to chipotle due to the lack of consistency and failing ingredients .. phoenix for another disgusting burrito filled with back bottom gristle steak
mexican	they seriously need to step up the customer service and their skills on how to make a fast food establishment speedy and convenient for people . if i could give negative stars i would .
mexican	try to bs you and tell you that you order something else . the compromise is you buy what you want and the other thing they made up . so they charge you for both ! ! ! ! haven 't been there in the day so only talking about late night
mexican	doesnt open in time its 9 and the dude said 10 mins come on man wtf this place needs to get its shit together .... its supose to be open
mexican	had burrito with sour cream and gauc with a soda . cost $ 17 . spend the extra money and go to a better spot .
mexican	super cheap about everything , refills on drinks , chips & salsa , etc . okay tasting food , but not flavorful at all .
mexican	portions weren 't very substantial considering the price , although the chile relleno i had over the holidays was decent , as was the queso appetizer - decent . but this is big bucks , big wait , and it felt like i was moving through a small maze to get to the restroom . server had an attitude and neglected us at several points during our dining experience . i hear about how authentic they are , but even if this is so , it 's just not worth it . also , very few options for vegetarians , unlike most mexican places which do have such options nowadays .
mexican	how about some autonomy and make an easy call to increase your daily sales ? why not be flexible and take my money ? this doesn 't make sense to me , there are so many other restaurant options in the neighborhood it seems crazy that they feel like they can wave their hand and turn away orders in such a cavalier way .
mexican	gross . overpriced . overrated . inauthentic mexican-wannabe food .
mexican	i had to run to my flight only to see my order was wrong ! also barbacoa is not mexican style ... very bad experience ! hungry and upset !
mexican	there is a strange feeling of solice despite it being packed . every patron is sitting at a two chaired table by themselves and knows they are getting shafted with this meal . prices are extremely high , service is a joke , and the food quality is meh . fast food has managed to figure out airports to an acceptable level . these mini restaurants have advantage of operating in this cage of hungry travelers and managed to create a minimally viable service .
mexican	quasi-cheese seems to be the primary ingredient in the food . the drinks are watery . the service is indifferent .
mexican	drive thru orders incorrect 50 % of the time . no straw , no napkins , don 't ask what sauce you want . skimpy on the meat , tacos already split open . prices 50 cents or more over tv commercials because this is not a franchise . it 's privately owned . i drive thru due to mobility problems . they don 't honor taco bell senior citizen offers or free drink , or diamondbacks offers . never going back .
mexican	garbage do yourself a favor . go to lindo michoacan if you want mexican food . best thing about cabo wabo is the name ! can 't believe such a good name can be dragged threw the dirt like this place .
mexican	pathetic . the corporate office should fire the regional manager for allowing this place to be so pathetic . staff changes alot , consistently bad . food quality is a gamble and usually substandard and the wait time ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? bank on waiting 30 minutes no matter what you get . this location irritates me and i stay out of it now because i 've been more than patient but they continue to be terrible . again , this place has been consistently bad and the regional manager- who is ultimately responsible- should be fired for not addressing the longterm issues at this location .
mexican	this is not a " nice " grocery store ; that being said , they sell liquor so sometimes it is a must stop . seriously , sapell 's . mop the floors once in a while .
mexican	this is easily the worst " mexican food " i have tasted in my life . the only thing mexican about the food might be the description on the menu . i ordered the tequila lime tacos and they honestly tasted like cardboard . the staff is attentive and quick and the venue is somewhat welcoming but the food is simply unacceptable . if the food was edible i might have given this place two stars to recognize the staff and their speed , but my disgust for the food prevails .
mexican	the prices are ridiculous , for food with no flavor . i paid $ 9.00 for a burrito ! the only good thing about this place is that it looks cute .
mexican	chips are terrible with little to no salt . staff is friendly and quick , but they skimp on what they put in your burrito or bowl unless you tell them multiple times " more please . " i 'm also convinced that they have no clue how to wrap a burrito as it is always messy when i open the foil which is of course maddeningly annoying . don 't bother going .
mexican	they will take your cash and refuse to pump gas . filing a police report now .
mexican	but food is go . but service suck i got there order was not field and wait 1 : 45 to fill it . i should of got in line it would of been faster . next time i will go to the one on sahara . that never happen to me at that location .
mexican	the service is horrible . they wont even bring you the drink you ordered . i ordered a coke and all i got was water . to top it off the manager doesn 't even listen to you if you have a complaint . he was rude to me and basically told me i was wrong . ( sorry but the customer is never wrong ) i will never go back there again .
mexican	service is so slow that it 's possible you could be in line for about an hour and 30 minutes . and the food has been sitting out for awhile , so it is not fresh
mexican	not a satisfied customer . dealer and waitress were rude to myself and my husband . in the line for the cashier , the security guard , vanessa , harassed patrons who were waiting in line when they complained that the systems and processes for cashing chips were broken . i personally waited with just two individuals in front of me for nearly 20 minutes . management , please reevaluate .
mexican	go to tacos el gordo only like 10 minutes away walking . this place is way over priced ! ! !
mexican	the " food " was served on a paper plate being not cooked , but microwaved ( i watched this go on in dirty hole they call a kitchen ) . a 10 year old could have made better food . i don 't remember what i ordered , i think my brain tried to wipe away any recolletion of the experience at jose and tony 's .
mexican	i stopped here to get a late dinner for me and my daughter . i ordered 2 # 7s the chicken finger meals . i could not understand the order taker he spoke low and didn 't speak english . the fries were old and cold and very crunchy like they were sitting for a long time . the woman at the window tried to give me 3 drinks , i ordered 2 , then she asked aight you get three ? ? ! ! ' what ? ? ! !
mexican	i was just eating the chips that they serve here and i find a piece of plastic in my mouth . disgusting .
mexican	the food is straight garbage . ordered a carne asada burrito and it was not fresh at all : the meat was not warm , like it has been sitting out forever ; the only thing hot was the tortilla it was wrapped in ( to make you believe the shit is fresh ) . i ordered here twice during the afternoon and it was okay , but still not fresh . just save your money and go elsewhere .
mexican	the nonalcoholic drinks suck . the employees are rude . and it 's packed with people who stand in land for 20 mins and still don 't know their order ... you might as well save your time and go to a normal taco bell .
mexican	do not come here unless you want to pay way too much for not enough , if you are the masochist and do want to pay a lot and not eat a lot prepare for the food to be bad too
mexican	i ate there and the food made me sick . food poisioning . i bought the 9 piece family bucket. it was all wings and legs with one thigh . no white meat . i got home and my wife wouldn 't eat it as she only will eat white meat . so i had to go get her something else to eat . the time before when i went there they were out of original recipe chicken . this was 5 : 30 pm on a friday night . i will never eat kfc again . think i will call the board of health on this place .
mexican	first off i was suckered in due to a groupon deal i seen . after my dinner i showed my groupon and was informed they did not want to expect it . i was stuck with the bill and very dissapointed due to the quailty of the food was not worth the outrageous price . chk quesadilla was watery and greesy . my friend ordered some dry steak tacos with no flaver if it wasbt for hot sause . the drinks were 11.00 for quevo margarita . which they advertised as top shelf . not authenic mexican food at all . u are better off going elsewhere for your mexican crave . unless u are into expensive water tasteless food .
mexican	my wife and i found finger nails in our food . this place needs to be shut down ! ! ! !
mexican	do not eat at this restaurant the pizza was cold and no good and they will not let us use the restroom i think the people working there wherespanish with no papers
mexican	absolutely horrible . tried the carne asada ... so bad . the small portion of meat was tough , grizzly , and had zero flavor . the worse part of this place is the stupid music blaring while you are trying to eat ... so annoying . not good , much better places to eat !
mexican	came tonight expected the best by the amazing reviews it was getting on tv , our expectations were set high , well it was horrible . my husband got the chicken quesadillas they were poorly made , the rice was green without any flavor . i got the three tacos carnitas ( pork ) again green rice it sucked refried beans horrible ! worst food in las vegas that we 've had. lemon drop was really good ! overall horrible experience ! do not recommend it at all !
mexican	entered with three employees dillydallying . undercooked chicken and shrimp . told me to throw it away and wait to the side . took 30 minutes to process credit card refund . unapologetic .
mexican	had a chicken taquito and country sausage . was the first and last thing i ate that day . an hour after eating my stomach got upset . several hours later i lost the contents of my stomach . 2 days later and i can barely keep anything down . it 's unfortunate because the food tastes good . i suspect it was the sausage , while i was eating it something didn 't taste right . unfortunately i ate it anyway , as it still tasted good . only gave it two stars because the employees were very nice and fast when it came to checkout .
mexican	the rice was a gooey clump of crap the cheese wasnt even real cheese and the meat tasted like it was a month old . i can clearly see how they poisioned people nothing is fresh here people ! ! !
mexican	i found a rubber spatula in my taco , and the waitress did not handle the situation well whatsoever . she apologized for my findings , but that was it , no offer for a refund or remake ( wouldn 't have accepted but still the offer would 've been nice ) . the chef did not even come out and apologize . disgusting. birds flying around the inside as you eat , too ghetto ....
mexican	we had the worst experience and our food was less than mediocre . the gentleman cooking was rude and he didn 't get our order right . he spoke only spanish to me and i did my best but he was visibly exasperated with me because we had a communication issue . i apologized for my lack of skill and felt very embarrassed . when i brought the food back to the hotel my family was pissed , it was terrible !
mexican	i got 2 chicken avocado burritos and when i got home as soon as i started to eat them , i realized the chicken had gone bad . took a 2nd bite and same thing . it was so disgusting and foul . i was so hungry i still at the bread and beans on the burrito . i should of gonna back to make a scene but it was the day of new yrs and i had plans . they know when the meat goes bad . they simply try to save money . how absurd ! ! ! stepping over a dollar to pick up a penny is what comes to mind . disgusted ! ! ! !
mexican	i would rate zero stars if i could . i had a burritto bowl here last night with steak and pulled pork and in the middle of the night i woke up puking and having diarrhea at the same time . i 'm certain i got food poisoning from chipotle as it 's the only meal i ate differently from my family yesterday . i 've literally been spewing from both ends at the same time , no exaggeration . i won 't be going back to any chipotles ever again .
mexican	i have eaten here a few times and the food was ok . nothing special but the location and drinks are good . today , it was obvious the rice was reheated . there was more rice than chicken in the burrito . the chicken wasn 't seasoned . i told the waiter the rice was old , he told me it wasn 't . if you want good mexican food go to three amigos on central ave in charlotte .
mexican	i 'm calling in the health inspector and district or corporate office and it really should be shut down ... it really needs a do-over if at all .. if you only go through the drive-thru you need to walk inside sometime ... i 'll bet you 've already had some sort of inconvenient unpleasant experience .. either way there 's too many places to eat people save your health .. do not eat here .. ! !
mexican	i ordered # 27 with green chili and it was horrible . we left full plates of food and the waitress didn 't even ask why we were leaving it . the restaurant was dirty and we left feeling itchy .
mexican	i ordered a simple taco salad . not only was it not good i got food poisoning from the bad meat ! we ordered our food to go but when i picked it up the restaurant reeked of mildew . do yourself a favor and go somewhere else !
mexican	i sat at the bar after a long stressful day of work and ordered the chips and salsa . i know what you 're thinking , " there 's no way a restaurant could mess up something as simple as chips and salsa " but ladies and gentlemen i 'm here to tell you that they did . to my horror , the chips came out with chunks of fried napkin ! ! ! this place is about as worthless as a shovel on a sea barge . again , do not eat here !
mexican	i swear to god i got sick pretty bad . i had bread and butter for breakfast . bought the day prior from smiths . i had no lunch . an hour or so after my baja fresh dinner i got really sick . this is 100 % dangerous . do not eat here . go anywhere else . just not here .
mexican	it smells like a sewer and the " food " looks and tastes like total crap ! ! ! ! ! i threw it all away ! we will never go back !
mexican	it smells like rotten eggs as you walk up and inside . they are not very friendly and do not cater to food allergies . the bathrooms are extremely dirty as well . they don 't really understand english either . i ordered a quesadilla and my cheese wasn 't even melted . wow ! not a happy customer and they didn 't even care ! ! stay away from here everyone !
mexican	i 've been up all night sick . the decor was cool , food was bland , the steak tasted like pot roast and the beans were sort of runny i normally am a mom and popper but in this case stick with chipotle or go to any authentic place down s.blvd. didn 't seem to clean i repeat up all night sick ! ! ! ! ! ! but enjoy if you are daring .
mexican	i was ecstatic to find they had a gluten free menu completely separate from their normal fare . after ordering tacos off the gf menu i knew immediately something was wrong after eating one taco . the waitress came around and i asked her the tortillas were gf , which they weren 't . she brought me gf tortillas but it was too late . i had already thrown up in the bathroom and was extremely sick . also , the margaritas are not smooth , and the chips and salsa are not free . if i could give a negative star review , i would . stay away .
mexican	the only thing our meals had in common was the beans . i also reported it with the southern las vegas health board . ew . & i 'm not even going to waste my time talking about the service . the girl working the register was super rude .
mexican	do not eat here. multiple cases of food poisoning from this location. unfortunately had to learn the hard way. don 't wish it on anyone .
mexican	my boyfriend and i went in to try it and got food poisoning . their guacamole looked like it was put in a blender and had no taste . we even put salt in it , and their was just no salvaging such terrible food . this place should change it 's name because it does not resemble mexican food in anyway . not to mention its over priced shitty food . worst place ever ! !
mexican	my fiance , our friend and i went here because they were hungry . when we returned home , my fiance opened his burrito to put hot sauce in and a cockroach crawled out of it ! it was disgusting . when we took the food back for a refund , the girl at the counter acted as if it wasnt a surprise at all , like it was normal to have bugs crawl out of their food . no problems with a return , however , but i wouldnt eat here if you paid me !
mexican	my first time trying this and it was a terrible experience . the staff did not know where any of their products were and constantly had to keep going to the back to check . most of their meats were not made and they don 't have " soya patties " as advertised on their website . the overall burrito was sloppy and it took them 20 + minutes to cash me out . the whole staff was very slow paced and confused . they put too much sauce on everything and the veggie burrito i ordered did not taste that great .
mexican	my sister and i ordered from this restaurant because we have tried a different nicks before and loved it . this location is a disgusting representation nicks famous shawarmas . not only did the shawarmas have hardly any meat in them , they made us both sick afterwards .... we both got terrible headaches and later puked up everything ... i have never eaten a meal that caused a headache before this . after looking up the restaurant online , it 's half a hookah store ? very disturbing ..
mexican	within an hour my stomach was upset and 4 hours later it only got worse . spent the night indisposed to put it lightly . manager refused to make amends and had me file a report ... sure that will get somewhere . you have been warned diablos will ruin your day
mexican	save your money ! this place is disgusting . my wife and i purchased a carne asada burrito bowl and a carnitas burrito bowl . in both of them the rice tasted old , the carne was chewy , fatty and bland . the carnitas was super sweet and it tasted as though there were marshmallows in it . then there was some weird chewy purple thing that stopped me mid-chew , it was the texture of soggy newspaper and did i mention it was purple . wth was in my food ? ? ? i will . it be eating here again , ever !
mexican	terrible service ! ! management ... including owner was incredibly rude . we are even investigating the restaurant because our credit card information ( as well as one member of our group ) was stolen .
mexican	the first nickel and dime restaurant i have ever visited . way overpriced , average price is $ 16 per plate and you get very little . food is over cooked , hard , stale chips . server got my wifes order wrong twice . the iced tea and iced water is from the tap ( not purified ) . i finally told the server we had to leave and needed the check . $ 40 for a beer , fish tacos , iced tea , chips and salsa that all tasted bad !
mexican	the food is microwaved and tastes like it came out of a box . yes , they have homemade tortillas , but the stomach ailment you suffer from after visiting here is totally not worth it . even the drinks are watered down and the place is full of viejitos . instead , take a short drive to cuco 's on buckeye rd off of stoughton and ask for diana . she makes great margaritas : )
mexican	the food is tasty--greasy , cheesy goodness , but my husband found a piece of plastic like from the top of a bottle or something in his chimichanga . crazy . how does that even happen ? ! ? ! ?
mexican	the food was so bland and disappointing . i had the fish tacos and i didn 't even taste the fish . plus the chips and salsa are not included . this place is too expensive for how crappy the food is . you are better off getting going anywhere else !
mexican	the food was the worst food i 've ever had . the beans were canned and the enchiladas were absolutely disgusting . i took 2 bites and told the server i didn 't like it , the manager said he would only give us 50 % off ! for 2 bites ? worst part of my vegas trip was eating at this place . i would give it negative stars if i could
mexican	the only cooking device i saw used was a microwave . the foam plate was slightly melted by it . the burrito had a tough tortilla indicating it was old or microwaved into submission . i asked for and got a refund . the food may have tasted good before it was nuked but afterwards was horrible . go down the street to and spend .50 more for a meal that is cooked ( read not microwaved ) and still has flavor .
mexican	they don 't not wash their hands or wear gloves when making food . i am disgusted ! they cook everything with bare hands and does not wash hands before making food
mexican	we came in to order 12 pupusas to go . they was one person eating and a party of 4 waiting for their food . the party of 4 cancelled their order because it was taking forever . our order was taken at 2 : 49pm , it is now 3 : 32pm and we are still waiting for our food . update : despite the long wait , the pupusas were good .
mexican	went here for my birthday ; there were seven of us . six of us got sick with one going to doctor and being diagnosed with viral hepatitis ... that comes from employees who don 't wash hands after restroom use and transfers bowel or urine remnant to the foods during prep . that then resulted in acute pancreatitis . missed work for a week and a half . most miserable week ever ! do yourself a favor ... do not eat here ! ! !
mexican	we will not be eating at this location every again ! it is worth the drive to mesa to get better service . they are not consistant and charge for chips and salsa which is a big no no when it comes to mexican restaurants . while the food is great , we cant go to this location anymore because we always leave in a pissed off mood . save yourself the time and money and hit up one of their other locations !
mexican	, , , , unsanitary and somebody should be calling the boss about that ! ! .... she didn 't change her gloves after i told another employee to tell her to do it while another employee was preparing my food . she was touching tortillas and cheese with those gloves . today is saturday 8 : 15 pm .
mexican	two days later my stomach is very bloated and i 'm still feeling very sick , i have the chills . not to mention that , the fish taco was very dry and not very good at all . i will never ever ever eat at this place ever again . i knew it always looked sketchy to begin with .
mexican	the pork slop called al pastor tasted like a slimy pile of seasoned salt covered in horse crap that was 2 weeks old . the carne asada tasted like salty dog food . the torrillas were like hard card board . i tried to cover the awful taste with over priced guacamole because i was starving , and it was alright , and the also several day old pico was almost edible . the staff who looked like they had been up for a couple days straight were pretty nice . i want to go make myself puke .
mexican	service is absolutely horrible . oh and to top it off we had to ask for chips and salsa . let 's me be honest who has to ask for that at a mexican restaurant . at 7pm on a friday night in a restaurant with 20 tables there are only 2 tables occupied . i wouldn 't recommend this place to my worst enemy .
mexican	or the tacos at least . i went with a friend of mine and her sister . i got tacos and they got other menu items . i am just getting over a 36hr food poisoning ! the food wasn 't even that good . i have had way better tacos . the people i went with weren 't impressed either . do not waste your time or risk your health at this place !
mexican	my kid had to use the restroom , so we ordered to go . stood there for over 15 minutes waiting for our order , watching over 10 vehicles go thru the drive thru and get their order . just shameful . corporate must have some crazy time monitoring of their drive thru service , but if you choose to order inside you will just wait and wait and wait . most of the time we waited it was this awkward staring at the two guys working the counter and wondering what the hell was taking so long .
mexican	worst tacos ever ! took half an hour to get them when the place was practically empty . what we were served was unedible . my friend actually asked if the shrimps were sea monkeys , and the guac was the consistency of baby food . most of them contained just tomatoes and bright orange , possibly fake , cheese . band was awesome , but those tacos still give me nightmares .
mexican	do not fall into the trap. the only good things about moes are the guac and the queso. and my boyfriend likes the soda machine. but the quality of ingredients is poor , the steak is gross. my boyfriend said the chicken was okay , not as good as chipotle though. almost everything has no flavor. the rice , the salsas. and our bill for guac and 2 drinks , a bowl and a burrito is $ 25 dollars ... not worth it what so ever. we read mixed reviews and decided to give it a shot , poor choice for $ 25 .
mexican	charleston location . for what ever reason they let you order then it comes out 15 mins later without avocado & cold . also do not pre-order and do drive thru because we called ahead and still waited 10 mins at the window . it 's just weird and slow & cold food there . so for some reason there they just let your food sit out for a while . not good .
mexican	i had the mexican caesar and i was sick right after eating it . the dressing was so gross , it tasted like mayonnaise . the cucumbers were warm . the chips were so greasy and the salsa wasn 't anything to brag about .
mexican	food was disgusting . carne asada fries were slathered with a weird gravy . the sour cream was missing . the guacamole was guacamole colored and that 's about the only similarity to guacamole . the salsa was a dark red almost black puréed concoction that had a hint of tomato flavor . the hotdog was fine because , well it 's difficult to mess up , but i will say it was cooked fine and had a good flavor . the mozzarella sticks didn 't actually have mozzarella inside them , it was just kind of congealed next to it . they did deliver on time , which is basically the only redeeming quality . i would not recommend this place for delivery .
mexican	do not get tamales with baja sauce ... it 's mush . burritos were crap and on top of that they make you pay for meat ? ! ? ! what the faaaack who does that ? ! ? ! ? mango margarita was pretty bad . i think they just add liquor into a pre made smoothie which is way too sweet . i 'll never come here again it was horrible
mexican	i had tried to order it twice now ( both to-go ) and it tastes like rubber . it was so horrible i had to pick every single piece out of my salad and throw it out . the texture of the grilled chicken is so disgusting and you can barley chew it . so gross . i basically just paid $ 10 for lettuce .
mexican	dry dry dry , tough meat and little flavor . wasted $ 15 for a dozen !
mexican	way too much guacamole and sour cream and it is really bland . kind of a mess. friendly service , cute little neighborhood atmosphere , but honestly the food is not impressive .
mexican	hands down the worst tacos i 've ever tasted in my life . leftover meat scraps drowning in marinade , with sweet cabbage . who makes a taco like that ? ! no pico , no onion , nothing that would typically be on a taco from literally anywhere else . salsa is straight out of a jar . the margaritas were super sweet and tasted like pure bottled marg mix - obviously not made fresh . take your $ 25 and go to tacos de las gordas , or frankly taco bell , for a more authentic experience .
mexican	the moment i picked them up , the entire tortilla just disintegrated and everything spilled out . i was at sams club yesterday and the tortillas i sampled there were at least twice the quality . the ingredients we 're decent quality for airport food , but i had soggy tortilla bits mixed in w / them . soggy tortilla . not my fav topping .
mexican	food . boring . drinks . average . bartenders , chime in when when drunk patrons are making things uncomfortable . wish this place was worth while , but the food has no creativity and the bartenders make a stale maragarita at best . maybe this place is better for lunch , but after dinner , they may have sleeping bags for nap time .
mexican	i live in the neighborhood and went to get to-go food and they have decided to change the prices on everything . i was charged 25 cents for each item i ordered to-go as a fee this place had really gone down hill since edgar left , and there are always young kids bartending who ignore customers and have their friends at the bar drinking . i 'm sad to see what has happened to this place .
mexican	ever ! ever ! really bad staff , service , and vibe ! ! ! ! trust me . do not go here ! ! ! i took a group of 6 there for cinco de mayo and the even messed that up . late / poor / bad service and food . you will have to beg for a water here .
mexican	if i could give a 0 i would ! this is the absolute worst slow cold taco bell in the history of taco bells. unbelievable junk. whoever runs this place needs fired asap .
mexican	my " country breakfast burrito " ( supposed to be potatoes , egg & cheese ) had five pieces of sausage in it . five . how does that even happen ? ? this has happened at least 4-5 times ( our office is close and the boss picks up breakfast burritos , i don 't have a choice ) and there is no consistency in their food . this burrito today had basically no cheese . other times there 's way too many potatoes and not enough eggs . this location sucks ! ! ! ! ! ! !

mexican	i got food poisoning from the carnitas plate and the menudo , not sure which one because i had some of both . the food looked good but was cold .. and i will never go back because the thought of it makes my stomach hurt .
mexican	crappy management , no wonder you lost a location .
mexican	i walked past here this morning 9 : 33am and their was dirty plates , cups , and other items left on multiple tables near the window the ones near east bridge street road
mexican	i was at this location yesterday and had the worst visit of any restaurant or fast food location ever . there were workers sitting on the counters where food is being prepared the got off and turned around and continued preparing food without cleaning . not to mention there was a workers kid running around the kitchen . two workers were talking on the phone when we stood waiting to order another was texting at the cash register while we waited . they were cursing and blatantly ignoring us . not a single table was clean and the food ended up making us all sick . and as we left a worker was smoking at the door forcing us to walk thru her puff of smoke .
mexican	ordered a chicken burrito . it was so bad ( the pico de guillo tasted like bleach ) that i finally decided to just throw it in the toilet .... you know ... to cut out the middleman . absolutely horrible .
mexican	save your money ! they will close early if they feel it is not busy enough . we attempted to go here for dinner twice and they had closed early ... the 3rd time was a charm , but the place itself is not ! . they had live music , a mexican group playing cha-cha music , which was horribly loud ! the chips were stale , & the salsa wasn 't really salsa ... it was more like hot sauce . i ordered the albongdigous ( meatball ) soup ... it was lukewarm at best . the chimichunga was just okay ... jim 's tacos were too spicy for him ... baja fresh is way better than this place ! ... just sayin ' .
mexican	their meet has a horrible taste , their chips are stale , and their sauces taste like it was made with dirty water . i 've been to other chipotles and i 've enjoyed the food , but coming to this location has made me never want to eat at this restaurant again no matter what location it 's at .
mexican	they cannot do their job ; in any way . i even saw one of the cashiers hanging out of the drive-thru window smoking something that a driver handed them . weight is literally around the building . staff is unprofessional to say the least . and extremely rude . i had a manager hang up on me
mexican	they charged my card for all this food i didn 't order . now i am awaiting for my bank to handle . the 2 managers up front complete ignored us , and the poor drive thru guys victor was handling the drive thru orders and the lobby orders . both managers were up front cursing and ignoring us laughing and joking . i am trying to get a hold of corporate to look into this and complain .
mexican	they never get your order right ! ! ! ! ! ! it 's almost everytime i order this happens . it 's ridiculous ! i will never go to this location again . i should 've known better when 3 months ago i got food poisoning from this location . obviously they don 't wash there hands either . gross ! ! ! ! stay away ! ! ! ! ! i 'll be calling the health dept in the morning .
mexican	even the general manager is in on it trying to fraudulently charge people , the service is terrible . it 's definitely not worth it .
mexican	we were told " i can take you over here " so i go to the check out and apparently we cut in front of someone else . i said i was sorry and did not realize that i " cut " in front of someone . then the cashier felt it was necessary to keep going on about it in the line . embarrassing myself and my son . i will never go here again .
mexican	would give 0 stars if possible . went here on a monday night and the place was close to empty . we wanted to sit at the bar and try some of their " 50 " kinds of tequila . a few steps in the hostess asked us to leave because we had a frozen drink with us from fat tuesday . said her manager has a huge thing against it . sorry , that 's vegas . been here for 4 days now and no other place has said a word . this place was lame and obviously the manager is an idiot to kick out customers before seeing what we planned to order .
mexican	there food is of very low quality , and very high prices for what you get . i was not impressed one bit . this is as bland and unoriginal as it gets , was really disappointed with the chicken ; flavorless .
mexican	inside is always a 15min + wait . tonight i waited 20min for one taco ! ! ! ! this is the third and final time each time was at least a 15 to 30 minute wait for food .
mexican	it 's not good and the soda machine was filthy . they weren 't clean people or a clean restaurant . i don 't trust it at all and i will never go back . more like omg that was fuckin terrible .
mexican	not worth your time , money or calories . first time not good their rice tasted like fast chinese food and they didn 't have grilled chicken for which peruvian food is mostly know for . gave them a second chance , no papa rellena , again no chicken . service is slow , non-courteous and food was bland compared to other peruvian food i 've had in other cities . they better make things better if they want to survive here .
mexican	the service is awful . i felt like i unwelcomed . their cook was told to make chicken nachos for my order . however , when i got home , i had beef . it is too much of a hassle to go back in there and deal with them . so i 'm just deciding to stay as far away from there as possible . it also smelled rancid in there .
mexican	it 's so bad ! first off , they forget about my kid 's quesadilla . don 't have the kids cardboard to separate the rice and beans . chorizo is burnt to the crisp . they burnt my quesadilla ! hardly any cheese in my quesadilla ! ! i mean how can you forget to put cheese in there ! the portions suck ! don 't know how to wrap a burrito . i am so disappointed . i want to contact corporate because they need some serious training . i love chipotle but just not this location .
mexican	they rude as fuck and forever getting your order wrong
mexican	finally , she came over and brought us to our table without saying a word or cleaning it off . she then proceeded to throw our menus on the table and told us to " enjoy " while already walking away . we had a coupon for another location apparently , the manager came out and said " next time .. look at the location on the email , " like we were stupid . ( the email had another address but stated nothing about it not being valid at other locations ) over all a terrible and gloomy experience from start to finish . we left before even finishing our chips due to the terrible and unwelcoming staff . avoid this location at all costs .
mexican	they are extremely slow ! ! ! ! ! ! ! if they don 't get their act together , they are going to lose many customers . maybe the same people who work at taco bell on broadway work here !
mexican	i called in an order went to pick it up and when i got there they said they were out of the item i ordered . what kind of low budget place takes your order gives you a total and then when you come to pick up your food its not available . that is really poor business practice don 't waste your time like they wasted mine .
mexican	they stole our credit card info ! ! ! ! it is very sad we have to deal with thieves !
mexican	if you go through the drive through you are greated with the smell of absolute shit . smells like there an open sewer right at the drive through entrance . the food is really good though , it 's just that the sewer will make you loose your appatite .
mexican	worse customer service ever . food was not even appetizing . messed up on my order then said oh we have no eggs . they expect every single person walking in to speak spanish . rude did not want to even give a refund . took about 30 minutes to just make my messed up breakfast burrito . i asked for management number and she goes here you go . don 't waste your time better places in phoenix
mexican	other then that chips are stale but tacos good .
mexican	not authentic . the food was ok , but the service left a lot to be desired .
mexican	they make excuses instead of just resolving issues as they should . they won 't be getting any more of my business .
mexican	the worst meat i 've ever had . waitress was great the food was pretty bland but chips were good .
mexican	i called in on 6 / 23 / 15 around 9 : 45am and the girl who took the order was so rude and was literally talking bad about be to the cooks while i was on the phone , and screwing me over by secretly putting more on the tab than i was asking for . incredibly unprofessional . will never go to this location again .
mexican	i got á la carte cheese enchiladas . how can u mess that up , right ? ? wrong ! ! i am adding a pic to show everyone . they were covered with cheddar cheese . weird but i went with it . the cheddar is also inside . no white cheese . shredded cheddar cheese throughout . wtf ? ? it was nasty nasty nasty .
mexican	most times there are very few people in line and you 'll just end up waiting for your order ... like i am right now .
mexican	pathetic service ! placed 3 different online orders and they couldn 't get any of them right ! twice i went there to pick it up , and they didn 't even start my order . both ordered 1.5 hours earlier . the only order that was on time was missing ingredients i requested . it 's not that hard to to make 2 burrito bowls with a 90 minute heads up ! i 'll start ordering from another location .
mexican	i ordered a veg bowl w / brown rice & black beans guac & cheese . when i got home i was very bummed out to my suprise i got a bowl w / white rice & no veggies with brown beans . it def. was a let down when you order something in specific & get the complete opposite .
mexican	this was my big mistake i 've made twice now . first of all when you order online thru yelp it 's gonna magically send your order to the eastern and trop location even though you told it at the seven hills one . and then to top it off when you show up at seven hills for your order , they tell you to f * * * off and go to the other location . terrible customer service even when it 's their fault . manager was supposed to call me today and you think they did ? hahahahahahaha if you guessed no , you are correct ! avoiding this place at all costs .
mexican	images of food on the app doesn 't consist with what they send . i ordered a steak quesadilla that looked like a large flour tortilla folded in half and received a tiny quesadilla for which i paid $ 5 plus $ 2 extra dollars for the rice and beans that they forgot to send ! i 've ordered before and haven 't had any problems til today . not happy with the service . there is much better taco shops than this place . my advice skip going to speedy tacos . the price doesn 't match the quality .
mexican	mexitaco is a 20 minute drive from my house and by the time i got home my enchilada and taco was soggy ( i do take out all the time from other mexican restaurants and this has never happened ) . the worst part was the enchilada was bland but the baja shrimp tacos were ok . for $ 13.99 the enchilada portion was disappointing . on the bright side the lady that took my order seemed polite .
mexican	they don 't use clamato just tomato juice that tastes spoiled .
mexican	what a disaster ! how can they serve such crap ! they should taste it before they serve it . other burritos are ok .
mexican	in a word , horrible . after waiting for some time for them , i take them back to my office only to find a tortilla filled with over fried , over-coated fish . i couldn 't even discern if there was any fish inside the burnt-tasting crust . just a couple of shreds at least . stick with the chicken , beef . they should totally take it off the menu if they can 't do it right . yuck !
mexican	i 've ordered my food twice way beforehand to pick up later . every time i have picked it up ( past my requested time i might add ) it 's not ready . oh yeah , and it was not busy either time . there was literally no line . and the greatest of all ? having people come in after you , order their food in line , and leave the restaurant with their food while you 're still waiting . i did not receive one apology from the cashier or anyone . horrible service .
mexican	the two times i have ordered online from this location they have completely jipped me on the meat ! they filled my burrito bowl with a ton of rice & sour cream and little to no meat ! ! such a waste of money ! ! not happy ! !
mexican	even after calling to complain about the unbelievable stinginess of my vegetarian burrito bowl , the manager even said not to order online because her staff is " antsy . " i actually thought the box for my food was empty . not coming back .
mexican	chimichangas were hard as a rock . chips & salsa was free . service is eh & the decor is dreadful . also they have a dj posted by the window ? why ? not sure , i guess they want me to suffer through pit bull songs while i complain about my crap tacos . downtown has some good spot , this is not one of them .
mexican	average everything and the bartender isn 't the happiest person and lacks attentiveness , which is important when trying to order another drink for more food or get a bill . it looks like it has potential perhaps under new management .
mexican	tried the quilaquiles . horrible soggy mess . looked and tasted like the had used the table salsa as their sauce . not to mention waiter took out order and we never saw him again . worst mexican food place in las vegas for sure . will not revisit .
mexican	very bland food and over priced ! price does not reflect their portion size or flavour !
mexican	went here at 8 : 00 pm on a wednesday , two cars in front of me and i sat in the drive thru for 20 minutes . extremely slow ! !
mexican	visit any other location . i 've been to this location 10 + times , but no more . the worst cashier you can have at any business , " noemi m. " i 'll be the nice one here and simply say she 's extremely rude . when you interact with this cashier , you will want to up and leave and take your hard earned money else where . speculation , but here demeanor was " i don 't want to be here , i 'm too good for this job . " this location manager should consider giving a huge pep talk . 0 % customer service skills .
mexican	i 've loved chipotle for years so i 'm really bummed out about this one because its closest to me .... this is the worst chipotle i 've ever been to . every single piece of chicken in my bowl is always either a disgustingly chewy piece of fat or a charred piece of something that tastes like its been scraped off the grill at the end of the night ... so upsetting . the empolyees clearly do not care what you eat and the quality of the food , its really just too bad . please for your own sake do not go here .... there is a great mexican place right across the street in the frys parking lot .
mexican	worst chimachanga ever . carne asada very good the tortillas were a disaster . soggy . chips and salsa nothing special . chips old and stale . burrito wrapped in cardboard . taco salad dressing not good either . besides it was expensive . across the street is the red white and brew which i highly recommend .
mexican	not only did i order a simple meal , i asked for nothing to be changed or edited . the ill-bred staff that this pathetic attempt of a restaurant are not friendly and take their grande ol ' time preparing the un-edible , soggy and cold pieces of mystery food . not one of the three things i ordered were correct . do not waste your time ! ! ! ! !
mexican	i usually go to this restaurant frequently , but my last two visits were horrible . the margaritas aren 't the same they taste watered down and the prices have gone up.dont ask to see management because lalo acts as if you are bothering him , after he takes 10 minutes to come out to your table . i notice the change of management and i didnt have these problems when armando was there.the servers are always nice and attentive.this restaurant has gone down and i will not be going back with my co-worker or family . i would be embarrassed to recommend this restaurant to anyone .
mexican	they did not have much of a selection and our burritos were filled with sour cream and had no taste . when we were seated we were told they were out of fajitas which was not possible because they came with the topping and meat that were in our burritos . if i could give negative stars i would , there are so many better mexican restaurants in madison .
mexican	$ 19 " appetizer sampler " was a total waste of money ! soggy nachos , re-fried taquitos , and a condescending manager named sandy who did absolutely nothing to rectify the situation . she did offer us a $ 10 gift certificate to patronize this business in the future and blamed the quality of food on their third party delivery service road runner . i give this place a negative 5 stars . keep your gift certificate sandy , we will not be back in the future f
mexican	you know what i mean . food = horrible . stale chips , salsa that tastes like ketchup , and more unworthy examples that is wasting both our time . see the first paragraph above , and repeat it to yourself . then , go elsewhere . you and your unmentioned body parts will thank me tomorrow .
mexican	i don 't feel or taste anything authentic . it 's just a very , very ordinary meal at an ordinary place . i had the most ordinary taco that i have ever had .
mexican	the management of luchitas should frequent their place and see first hand what makes then successful - from the top down . i 'll only visit luchitas if i 'm walking downtown and want to get a drink . luchitas bar is much better but that 's where it ends .
mexican	i guess i can say we are somewhat spoiled now in gta with all the burrito options we have here . the competition is very serious and these guys are not doing their best to keep up . on the plus side , the place looks fresh and the food is safe to eat . on the minus side , the food tasted meh . it 's fast food with the emphasis on the word " fast . "
mexican	the cooks always add it , even though i 've always asked them not too . when i ask , the man who takes the order says " we never put cheese on this burrito " and then i check and bam , its there . foods good when order is right , but just beware when you have special orders .
mexican	they close whenever they want to and don 't care about turning away customers who just arrived on a flight . 9 : 30 on a saturday night ? ridiculous .
mexican	if i were you , go get a shawarma instead at half the price with the same size portions . obviously this place isn 't out to attract customers , business is slow , the decor is horrendous and the food is subpar and overpriced . would i go there again ? probably never ! could this place do better ! ! of course but there 's a long way to go . lastly , can 't a californian find a decent burrito place in toronto ! where 's a baja fresh or chevy 's when you want some fresh mexican .
mexican	this is the worst mexican food ever . everything tasted store bought . not even 1 star per amigo
mexican	bathrooms are falling apart toilet seats falling off the toilet , filthy , and with no soap available even upon request meaning no employees wash their hands ! ! ! major health code violation . zero stars . wouldn 't even let my dogs eat here .
mexican	went in and realized that their tapas menu was missing key dinner items . left the restaurant after explaining to the waiter why we were doing so . waiter and manager gave us both unpleasant looks .
mexican	ordered an horchata but got watered down skim milk ; ordered shrimp burrito which was too bland . not coming here again
mexican	lazy employees . unsanitary restrooms and play area . do not recommend this location at all ! got very sick after eating here .
mexican	the burrito is not $ 4.25 as it says on the posted menu , it is $ 6.00 .... the jr. burrito is $ 4.25 , not the regular one . and its not a very large . i can 't imagine how tiny the jr. burrito is .... probably more like an egg roll . mariana 's , the hispanic grocery store , has much better and less expensive burritos at their food counter . i won 't be returning to los tacos .
mexican	food is basically don miguel frozen entrees . if you like food that taste like it 's out of jar without any flavor ; then this is the place for you !
mexican	my chicken taco was so dry that a knife couldn 't even cut it . it 's easy to tell that it was chicken reheated from the previous day , and not properly reheated . fish tacos were the same . we hardly ate any of our food . will not be returning .
mexican	their " alcoholic slushies " are a joke . i got the yard cherry slushie with rum . and i can 't taste a single bit alcohol . my friend got a small baja blast with bacardi and you can barely barely taste the alcoholic . i tried to see if i can get my money back . but they don 't do refunds for drinks . the cashier told me there is 2 shots in the yard . ! ? ! ? ! are you serious ? ! just 2 shots ? ! ! where 's the rum though ? ! taco bell cantina , you 're such a disappointment . i 'll just stick with my fat tuesday . they never fail me !
mexican	this place is a dump . the service is horrible . no refills on the small glasses of water ... warm beer .. small plate of chips ... waitress answered her own phone when serving us the plates . mushy pre- made tacos ... rice was 3 days old . prices are fine but you get a better meal at taco bell . not kidding . trust me you will be dissapointed . it 's terrible . no quality mexican places in tempe ....
mexican	this place is way to expensive for the portions they serve . you will leave the place hungry and broke . i 've eaten tapas in spain , and these prices are ridiculous . send the chef back to the strip and give us a restaurant that most of the locals can afford to eat at . let the 1 % cook at home or starve for all i care .
mexican	ordered a taco with everything and two gorditas to go .. we waited over 30mins .. because they made the wrong gorditas we wanted chicharon and carnitas .. they made two alpastor .. no sorry no nothing . on the way home , the taco was ' naked ' no salsa no onion no cilantro .. the gorditas .. not fresh and not gorditas .. mostly beans and lettuce and lard no carnitas no chicharon .. hard and dry . so damn disappointed
mexican	the person that takes the order is highly unlikely to follow protocol . i proved it today walking in early to pick up my order and no one changed gloves or changed out the cheese or lettuce . yet it wasn 't marked on the order as a gf bowl . people have no idea how sick one can get from cross contamination . most don 't care . it 's disturbing .
mexican	i love roberto 's but this is the worst one i 've seen .
mexican	if i would have just gotten in line , i would have been out of here and eating at home already . but i ordered 45 mins ago and im still waiting-- they ran out of rice and then they ran out of beans . but im standing here waiting as the ' manager ' says ' its almost ready ' and im aatching the huge line off people walk away with their food , no problem . what-the-actual-fuck ? ! worst cafe rio . e v e r
mexican	when i got here , they didn 't know the order was placed ! they didn 't even start making it untill we get here ! ! ! this is the third time they 've done this to me . watched the whole line go through , while waiting on two meals : /
mexican	very frustrating experience as all the different locations seem to have completely different coupons . do yourself a favor and avoid them .
mexican	they always run out of grilled chicken and only have the fried chicken left over from the day.also the good empanadas are also gone.yuca , forget it it 's gone too ! what a shame management can 't get it together.this happens frequently !
mexican	tacos were not fresh and not presented well . walk a block or two and eat better someplace else . # igotabadtasteiymouth
mexican	food is bland . service is eh . i ordered 4 enchiladas , they came on four separate plates which was a little awkward . if you get stuck there , go with the shrimp or cajun fish .
mexican	food was blah . it had no flavor . both of us felt sick the next day , stomach cramps and more . service was not good either , very hurried .
mexican	open 24 hours my ass . lazy pieces of shit
mexican	they don 't have double front doors so you feel the wind throughout the entire store and freeze . poor design .
mexican	online order was entered at 7 : 00 for 7 : 30 pickup . they gave us an entirely wrong order and lost my original order . food had to be remade . completely out of guac , sour cream , and salad dressing . 25 minutes later we had the new order . so much for ordering online !
mexican	went to the drive thru and ordered 2 chicken tacos . it 's taco bell , not rocket science , so i drove off without checking the order i was given . got home with 2 beef tacos that went straight in the trash . employees seem friendly but trust that you won 't get an accurate order here no matter how fast they greet you .
mexican	he didn 't show up for our first appointment , and didn 't respond to my messages to confirm or cancel . i think it was meant to be , as i found a better and more reliable taco caterer . glad this didn 't happen the day of my event , as i see some others had this bad experience of his no show for their event . terrible way to run a business ! !
mexican	they don 't start making your food until you show up and about 20 people in line go through a head of you . worthless staff .
mexican	overpriced and beef taco was like shoe leather . rice was much like instant rice . the cheese used in the enchilada was like cheese wiz . they won 't see us again . we had a gift card , so naturally we used it but if we had to pay out of pocket , we would have kicked ourselves out to the empty parking lot .
mexican	stopped here before hockey game and ordered the salsa , chips and guacamole . was just ok . then made the mistake of ordering the mahi mahi tacos . fish was very fishy tasting and not lot of other flavor . rice was terrible and the beans tasted like they came out of a can . not good at all ! would not recommend ! would give it zero stars if i could .
mexican	you will waste your life watching the workers piddle around aimlessly . i was in here today with 7-8 people in front of me , didn 't even get to the front for 20 minutes . food is average chipotle , although the portions are also lacking .
mexican	went for the lunch buffet and it sucked . really bad . this is a mexican restaurant ? the buffet had italian , german , and other food but not mexican . and it wasn 't that good either . very disappointed .
mexican	we also could see all of the cooks standing out back smoking while everyone was waiting . the window clerk didnt even come to the window for a good 10 min to even simple say hello and be courteous . when she did come to the window , i said " we 're actually going to leave now ... the wait time and things you are out of is rediculous " she said ok and shut the window .. no i apologize or sorries at this place ... we drove to the kfc up on gilbert & chandler blvd .. much better service ! they had food and a smile to go with it . dont know what happened to this kfc .. wont ever go back .
mexican	dont bother with cafe rio. ordered catering for our sons engagement party what a fiasco. will never waste money on cafe rio again. first and last time. will go back to costa vida for our party needs from here on out. both the local and the corporate operations need lessons in customer service. none had empathy or gave a crap about the fact that they messed up a large order for 50 people and left my guest waiting for an additional 45 minutes for their incompetence. run far far from this restsurant
mexican	they 're so syrupy it 's impossible to drink an entire glass . i recommend splurging an extra two bucks and going over to madison 's where they serve a delicious , fresh $ 3 margarita on tuesdays . i also was not very impressed by the tacos . i don 't get why there are such mediocre restaurants in such a prime location in madison !
mexican	the service was excellent , but the food was horrid and far out weighted the service . the rice was so bad that i later realized it had chipped a tooth . the experience led to the relegation as to why the restaurant is named " dos gringos , " i had a bout of montezuma 's revenge , which would 've conquered any spanish conquistador .
mexican	very unwelcoming . the staff ignores people with kids . this didn 't even happen to us but rather a family we witnessed be treated this way . we 'll never come back .
mexican	it 's not good during happy hour and yelp doesn 't say that ( which it should before you buy it )
mexican	really pisses me off . every time i come to this chipotle they give half the meat . no wonder chipotles are doing no good . i 'm here because there was no line and in a hurry . no lines at chipotle anymore because their quality , including employees have gone down hill .
mexican	don 't come here at all bad customer service waiting almost 40min for a chicken burrito
mexican	even if the wind is so strong it blows you into this store , fight it , get into a vehicle , and floor it to the chipotle in coventry . this place always skimps out on food . ask for an extra scoop and they pick one singular topping and urge you to move on . just forget about the guac . you pay $ 2 but they 'll only give you 50 cents worth . ask for more and they 'll charge you extra . if you request a tortilla on the side they 'll probably forget to put it on your bag as they did for my friend .
mexican	went here to get it to go and i swear it was the slowest service every ... like right from the order . i was waiting 10 minutes , and they didnt even say hi . service : -1 stars then i order and wait the normal amount of time for a burrito , only to realize its not my burrito . finally i ask and they decide they 'll make my burrito . and after 30 mins its finally ready . decent burrito , nice atmosphere , service that 's legal torture , so all in all dont get takeout , and maybe get a combo the navhos looked good .
mexican	full parking lot with no one inside should 've been a good enough sign to go never mind ...
mexican	i called to order food for a company party . i specifically told them i need it at 10 : 50 , got there at 10 : 55 to give them a few minutes . 11 : 20 the food is still not ready ! ! ! ! they made me late to the party . never bothered to call and tell me it wouldn 't be ready and they were not that apologetic either . there are a few other salvadorean restaurants near them , spare yourself , and choose anyone but this one !
mexican	i waited in the drive through line for 15 minutes . the first two items i wanted were sold out . when i finally got my ofer , it was wrong , cold and not very tasty . to top it off , the staff was rude . with all the options in monroeville , not sure how they stay in business .
mexican	it 's a little better than this place . you won 't feel rushed ! the food will be so much more delicious !
mexican	our service was terrible . my drink came after my food and both were ordered at the same time . my friends food ( quesadilla ) was only 2 tiny triangles . food is over priced . not worth a penny . vegas is full of good food . save yourself the experience and go somewhere else !
mexican	save your time and money ! terrible service ! cold to no personality ! no warmth or a friendly hello . it took 20 mins to get two hard .99 cent tacos . the food was taco bell grade .
mexican	i haven 't taste t food yet , but i 've already decided not to come back ever . the guy at the cash treated us as if we were implied to know their menu details and exclusions . didn 't take 2 secs to let us know the beverage options included on the combo and got upset when we asked for a jar to instead of a canned pop . the girl preparing the burritos was very cheap with the toppings and also expected us to know what everything was . overall terrible service
mexican	all the wait staff was so focused on cleaning up and shutting down the bar to busy to ask how your meal was , had to flag them down to order dessert . no one checked up on me once . will not come back again late night . the carne asada taco had huge chunk of grizzle in it , fish taco and the standard were good . churros were good but the chocolate dipping sauce tasted like watered down chocolate milk . bummer because it 's a cool place .
mexican	limited menu but good food . service was inattentive and slow . stated at 11 : 10 for 11 : 15 reservation . food didn 't come until after 12 : 30 . i was just about to head for the doors and qdoba around the corner when our food actually came . they need to do better !
mexican	that 's for sure . the restrooms is located in the bar next door . not the restaurants bar but a different business and it 's connected so while u enjoy your food be prepared to hear yelling . the mess up part is that they sat all of the customers right next to the bar and not at the other end of the restaurant which was empty . chip and salsa was good . food was ok . we had tacos and a combo . so overall kind of sucked i wouldn 't come back .
mexican	go to the one on charleston / town center instead its not that far . always gets the order wrong if it 's right they have to repeat it 100 times to get it never have the total before you get to the window poor customer service
mexican	i 've been several times , and my minimum wait has been around 10 minutes in the drive thru . tonight i 've been in line for roughly 15 , enough time to log into yelp and type in this review .
mexican	none of the employees here do . every time i go i have to repeat my order , then i hear some rustling , and a new person ( who also doesn 't speak english ) asks if they can take my order . i 'll have to repeat it to them again too . i once got the completely wrong order , tried to give it back to the person at the window , and they shook their head and said they didn 't know what i was saying , then closed the window on me .
mexican	this place will make you sick ! crap food everywhere !
mexican	it 's not a coincidence that it 's next to the worst walmart in the country . service is slow
mexican	go somewhere else ! ! ! ! ! my daughter had a hair in her quesadilla , our chicken crispers tasted like fish , and even the fries were old . they offer nothing to make it right , only took the quesadilla off the bill .
mexican	dont do it. i love tacos and if you do to then go somewhere else. horchata was warm ? ? carne was bland , salsa was mild as ketchup , pastor was bland , the mf bill was sooooo high
mexican	i would rather eat taco bell out of a public trash can . sooooooo gross and of course way over priced . if i could give a negative star , i would . unfortunately we had the pork chimichonga & chicken nachos , yucky .
mexican	not even close to the ... " birtos " family or anything similar ! teenage kids serving canned goods on tortillas . i wanted to like it and cannot . counting the days this place can stay alive .
mexican	stop ... the only positive thing i can say about this place is that it was nice & clean , plus the service was super quick - as it should be if you are the only people in the place ... was my first indicator that the food wasn 't that great ; and it most definitely was not ! do yourself a solid and just hit chipotle , cafe rio , or baja fresh ; or better yet pick up a california burrito from roberto 's to pass off to the staff cause i doubt they eat there either !
mexican	don 't do it. the margaritas were watery , the chicken wrap was so bland i couldn 't eat the other half , they were out of fried oysters , and the service was a bit slow. the best part of my experience at san felipe 's cantina was the fact that i got to enjoy watching football while not enjoying my meal. there you have it. short and to the point. there are so many better options in the tempe marketplace .
mexican	the worst food ever . i ordered the breakfast burrito and it made me sick . i wish i wouldn 't have eaten any of it - esp before flying ! lesson learned .
mexican	this place is a horrible location . turned in for so quick gas and i 've been waiting in this line to get out of the gas station for 20 + minutes . avoid this location at all cost .
mexican	way to expensive for the kind of food served . fish taco 's served with fried fish ! yikes ! my son had the " live " queso and chips . he thought this would be fun to see them made at the table . all the server did was dump the cheese , etc. in the bowl and stir ! not much of a show for 8.00 ! bad nachos . however the chips and salsa at the table were good .
mexican	it tastes like they use dirty dishwater to water the drinks down : - / the service was great ! the food was subpar , i ordered the veggie enchiladas & the best part was the rice & beans on the side . chips & salsa was good ; - )
mexican	super dirty , the guy working the window is only friendly if you 're spanish speaking . never again . the same guy just sprayed windex on the inside of the glass that the sides are in .... without taking the sides out first . good luck to whoever eats that . windex carrots and everything else . terrible this needs a health inspection
mexican	they are slow . so slow . they are rude . and your order will not be right . i have given them several tries and they fail each time . the price is different every time i eat there and get the same stuff . not going back here .
mexican	the taco bell employees wont stop dogs in the restaurant or even question homeless people living there . go somewhere else if you have to get your bell on .
mexican	ever ! overpriced . dry chicken . nasty beans . tasted like a tv dinner . the drinks are super weak . nice looking restaurant tho ! just needs a new cook .
mexican	i found a yellow finger nail in my soft shell taco . i was eating there so i took it up to the counter to show the manager who acted as though it really wasn 't a big deal . in fact he offered to refund me for the taco , not the meal i bought , just the taco . um ..... thanks but no thanks . i 've never eaten there since . what made me even more mad was i wrote a letter to the owner regarding the situation and never heard a response . very poor professionalism ..... not even an apology ! ! ! ! it 's too bad i loved taco johns .
mexican	i took one bite of my taco and threw the plate away . food was cold and old . complete waste of money .
mexican	$ 15 for a burrito that tastes like it came from the back dumpster. go next door and eat a pastry at starbucks .
mexican	one of the worst burritos i have ever had . it was almost all tortilla and they didn 't add the guac i paid extra for . gross .
mexican	our server barely spoke english , had to repeat our order multiple times , and was apathetic / incompetent . fajitas were completely burnt . the onions and green peppers were black and tasted like char . shrimp tacos and burritos came out cold . when we sent them back , our server didn 't apologize and brought back a small plate with one taco , and had taken the beans / rice off the dish . thanks ? prices were outrageous for the portions . 21 dollar fajitas came out with four shrimp . the only decent thing was the margaritas and even then , you can find much better on the strip elsewhere . hard pass .
mexican	service suck as hell waitress and waiter were taken selfie at the cash register. we just ate here and had hair in our food told waitress she look at us like we were lying ... never will i eat at this location
mexican	the chicken tacos were bland with no flavor . the margaritas were juice . the service was horrid . we had to ask to pay our bill .
mexican	the food is awful and the staff does not know the menu . the chips are stale , the salsa is grade c and they don 't even give you your own bowl to dip out of !
mexican	there are plenty of other options in the neighbourhood . i ordered the daily special steak sandwich and it was terrible . the nachos sucked too .
mexican	don 't eat here they mess up your food and don 't care we thought it was if you ordered my delivery but we went down early when no one was there i 'm very unhappy with the way they don 't even try to fix it when they mess up l , most be rude cooks they don 't please at all front of house was friendly but not helpful in fixing the bad food don 't chance it
mexican	they never have anything ! ! ! every single thing i ordered they were out of ! then when i received my food it was not what i had ordered ! some of the workers were touching the chicken pieces with their bare hands ! ! and the little chicken that did make it to my plate was cold ! !
mexican	stay away. my husband and 3 other co-workers had food from this location , and when he opened the sandwich wrapper , he said it smelled like semen ! omg ! in the trash it went. gross !
mexican	woke up this morning feeling extremely sick , i know what a case of bad food poison feels like . was craving mexican food last nite , and now i regret it !
mexican	you 've been warned ! ! i had 2 cheese casidillas here and later the same evening i was vomiting of violent food poisoning . never again will i eat chipolte .
mexican	wish i had eaten the less healthy mcdonald 's a few hundred feet away at half the price . the wife and i only at the breakfast here where i 'm assuming is not where they excel based on the other reviews . either that or nobody in the area knows what mexican food is supposed to taste like . will not be coming back .
mexican	just light your money on fire , waste 2 hours of your own time , and eat canned beans . the absolutely slowest service i 've ever experienced on non-peak hours . it was almost as if she was annoyed to have customers . no drink refills . the food runs either bland with no seasoning or entirely too spicy in a way that makes your tongue bleed . 5 out of 10 on the " spicy scale " should not be inedible .
mexican	i guess my spanish is rusty , but i thought queso is cheese . i am pretty sure there is no cheese in this dish . it tastes like watered down chili .
mexican	went for lunch the place was empty and the service was also like the other reviewer said " nonexistent . " the basket of chips were all broke and when we asked for another basket the waitress just grabbed them off the table . will not ever come here again business must be good for them to be be able to lose customers
mexican	we spoke up and she said it was her first day so if that 's so she should get a better trainer . sorry but never will i go back
mexican	you 're better off going hungry , or with an overpriced protein shake from one of the food stands . i 'm not even sure where to begin -- the service was so slow my co-worker and i almost had to cancel the food we ordered , or miss our flights . when the food arrived it was bland , tasteless , and worse than anything i could have thrown together at home blindfolded . later in the day , the quesadilla i ordered and only partially ate caused me great intestinal discomfort . dirty , bad food , poor service . ugh !
mexican	i called in and ordered two burritos and added cheese . when i went to pick up my order they got the whole thing wrong and didn 't even fix it or let me add cheese because they wanted to charge me extra for it . i only had my debit card and they can 't charge the register if it 's under $ 2 . absolutely horrible customer service . they screwed up and made me pay extra to fix it .
mexican	i got so sick from their nasty uncooked meat . gross i 'm still sick . don 't ever eat here unless you want to die . plus their serving size is repulsive no wonder i got sick . how does a place like this even open . dirty ass mexicans ..
mexican	we just ordered from m4 , and after the first burrito bite i immediately chucked it in the garbage . if i had wanted gray , cold , swampy food , i could of just gone outside and scooped a chunk of melting ice / gravel mix from our parking lot . doing that also would of cost 12 $ less than what m4 charged us for this roll of disappointment . i ended up having a gluten-free toast with peanut butter for dinner , and it was awesome .
mexican	there customer service is the worse . i spend over $ 25 for lunch for my family and it was all messed up , wasn 't cooked all the way through and the tortilla was stuck to the wrapper , and ripped the whole burrito ! then when i called he talked to me for 5 mins then asked to " put me on hold cause he had other things that were more important " so i said ok , and he had me on hold for as long as possible until he took it off and once he realized i was holding , he hung up . super messed up ! -this was my first time coming , and will never come again .
mexican	i ordered lunch using grubhub and was very disappointed . i did not receive what i ordered and the food i did receive did not look edible , not sure if it was beef or pork . asked for beans , no beans .
mexican	and on top of all their mistakes they don 't give a damn or acknowledge any mistakes . they mess up orders that are black and white and straight to the point . i didn 't even get an i 'm sorry we messed up . i just got an oh . yes i got a refund and i 'll stick to the blue diamond location .
mexican	first , the place it 's disgusting cause they don 't clean the tables and i asked if they have a restroom and the stupid hispanic guy that doesn 't even know to speak properly . he answered me the restroom is only for employees . what the fuck ! ! ! what kind of place it this where the costumers can wash their hands . this please should be closed .
mexican	every time i order from this location they forget something like chips , guacamole , my sons quesadilla in his kids meal . wont be going to this location anymore .
mexican	( i knows it 's mexican / asian infusion so even free wontons and salsa would have provided some saving grace ! ) expensive but doesn 't deliver ! small portions come with hefty price tag . one small ( not even taco bell sized ) taco is $ 5.50 . extra $ 1 for dipping sauces . expect to pay at least $ 30 for two drinks and at least $ 50 for two entrees . waiter was rude ; he asked if i actually had a food allergy or was just trying to cut weight . seriously ?
mexican	this was my third time is the charm visit and they failed . we sat there with empty glasses at the bar and got passed for 20 min . when we finally asked for our check it took another 15 min . i 'd go into detail about my previous times here but it 's not worth it . i 'll just say this was right on par . so long casa .
mexican	i miss the chicken hearts , cupim beef , linguica , ( pork sausage ) and seafood just to name a few . everything they serve is top quality though , but at $ 52.50 per person , it should offer more " authentic " bbq .
mexican	so loud in there . made me wonder- is this place a nightclub or is it a restaurant ? fine either way but owners should make it one or the other food is nothing to write home about . fish tacos were greasy and carnitas had chunks of fat in them . salsa and ceviche were very good . speaking of salsa . if you want it you have to pay for it . what decent mexican restaurant out there charges for chips and salsa ? beans and rice are also a la carte and are not included with your meal . if you are looking for a fun loud nightclub i recommend this place . don 't go there expecting a memorable dining experience .
mexican	it 's nothing special . below average chips and salsa . unfriendly wait staff . food came out quickly . i had the steak fajitas . the fajitas were just ok . the flavors are plain and the place is about what you expect from a generic mexican place in a strip mall . not going to be back .
mexican	meat , cheese and salsa doesn 't cut it . wish you could add sour cream , beans , lettuce , etc . sadly , we won 't return .
mexican	authentic tacos ... i don 't think so . . food was mediocre at best . carne asada was fatty and chewy ... al pastor was dry with no flavor and the chorizo was average .. if you 're looking for great tacos in vegas you should try ( frijoles and frescas ) .. unfortunately we will not return to tacos el gordo
mexican	i asked for them to add more lettuce at least and they just said no . i should have returned my salad .
mexican	if you 've been here before you already know ! i was here for a business meeting and the nachos were just horrible ! what is that ? velveeta ? ! it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant . i 'd say it 's slightly better than the nachos at taco bell / del taco but if you don 't try this place , you 're not missing out . trust .
mexican	tacos are too expensive for the taste . will not give them a second try .
mexican	i like loud music . having gone to more live rock concerts than just about anyone . but today at this place , the music was so loud the employee 's could not hear each other . i told the guy at the register , " the music is a little loud isn 't it . " he just stared at me and did not lower the music . othe people came in and walked out . this place has gone down hill .
mexican	they are out of stuff all the time and they take forever to get your food it 's so frustrating to me because chipotle is supposed to be in and out in less than 10 minutes but this location really needs some work if i could give it -1,000,000 stars i would .
mexican	i love love mexican food i 'll eat anything ! ! but the meat here is so disgusting ! ! how do people eat . the garlic taste is so strong that all you taste is garlic . nasty .
mexican	i arrived at 1 pm and they were out of the grilled corn for the day and the lady tried charging me extra for the guacamole ( since i asked twice about the corn i 'm guessing and was extremely rude and seemed as if she hated her job ) but i knew qdoba doesn 't charge extra so .. worst qdoba experience here . unless you like rude people making your food , don 't come to this qdoba .
mexican	this taco bell , not so much . it 's hard to go anywhere when the people that work there obviously don 't give a flip about their jobs or doing them well . have some pride in what you do even if it 's not the end-all-be-all of your existence . i will drive quickly past this taco bell to get to a better one .
mexican	though it 's really hard to want to go back seeing as these kids behind the counter constantly talk about their guests in spanish . i 'll probably give it another shot but i would enjoy this location more if the staff wasn 't constantly making fun of their guests as if no one understood them .
mexican	it 's fresh . it 's flavorful . it 's delicious . but the service though . bad service and high prices isn 't enough to keep me coming here . i gave them three tries and was disappointed every time . i hope they turn it around . lower the prices ... and for god 's sake , you don 't need a valet - we need those parking spaces .
mexican	every single time there 's something wrong : - terrible service - main dishes sometimes served with sides ( rice and salad ) but sometimes not ( why ? ! ? ) - got an order delivered last night and only had 3 tacos in my plate instead of the 4 promised ; how can a cook make a mistake like that ? blows my mind it goes on and on ; hopefully they 'll make some adjustments in order to improve consistency of the service .
mexican	no apologies no solutions . the ' manager ' had the same deer-caught-in-the-headlights blank expression . he said we should have known that the cashier was talking about a different dish when she asked if we wanted salad or fries - what ? ? ? obviously he had no solution . the owner who stepped out from behind the scenes proposed that we pay the difference between what i actually ordered and what we got . but we had to line up all over again to get what we actually ordered . that said the owner disappeared into the back again . by then we were so hungry we couldn 't stick around . don 't go if you are hungry !
mexican	it is a very small space and the news blaring makes the whole experience just not worth it .
mexican	if they had any tequila in them i couldn 't detect it . lemonade at best . the food was mediocre . the service was good .
mexican	unless you enjoy disappoint in your life - skip it ! taste like cheese , tomato and green chile that 's blan.rice is plain and refried beans are salty as hell . why can 't i give 1 / 2 a star ?
mexican	don 't get the fish tacos they only come with slaw ( coleslaw ) it also comes with a piece of avocado , the fish was the same size as the avocado dead flowers chef rivals in the kitchen no sauce for the onion rings sangria from days ago-soft apple pieces- waitress semi present
mexican	such a waist of even a name for them . it was basically a burrito cut in two , stuffed with different types of cabbage and peppers with white sauce . that 's it ! i found a total of 4 nickle size shrimp , one of which was found on the plate and other two tacos didn 't have any shrimp . plenty of cabbage tho . the waitress did apologies after showing her and offered something else . they were also out of soda when i was there . management should know if there is a problem they cant control , like the soda machine going down , they should focus extra hard on things they can control like the food .
mexican	added cheese and sour cream and had light salsa on it . however , no cheese was on it . barely any meat . had i not been so lazy i would 've went to roberto 's but no drive-through . waste of money
mexican	to say the management doesn 't care about your constant wrong order is an understatement . and you won 't get your money back either . i was also being charged $ 3.00 for extra lettuce on my tacos which only actually contained extra lettuce about 25 % of the time . never again .
mexican	by the gods ... it is located in a mall parking lot which is situated adjacent to an intersection of two arterials . the parking area is a small cul-de-sac with one entrance . " can i have some extra sour cream ? " " que ? " " i 'll pay extra . " " this is what you get . " " ok burrito nazi . is there a taco bell around here ? " limited menu . mes thinks this was built for " unregistered ' guest ' workers . "
mexican	they stop selling half the menu after 11pm but they are open 24hours . if you want high priced fast food topped with old dirty lettuce this is the place for you !
mexican	also , it was so noisy when ordering they got so many things messed up and double-billed us for an entree . to top it off , my pork tasted like sugar . gross . i will not be back .
mexican	go here if you are looking for good margs and a great atmosphere . disappointing .
mexican	the give you half portions and will tell you they are full portions . i have never been to a chipotle where i was still hungry after eating . usually i can never finish because it is so much . when they first opened the gm said we may ask for a little more with no extra cost . but now they are charging for a few extra pieces of chicken . an after you pay for that extra 3 pieces it is now a right portion .
mexican	i got stomach upset after i ate their carne asada burrito . the standard is not as filbertoes or riva 's . stay away
mexican	i received a mexican pizza and nachos that tasted like soap . yes , soap folks . another time , i went in to get food and the man who handed me my food had at least a half inch of dirt under his fingernails . i will never go back . i also don 't think i can ever go back to a t bell again .
mexican	it 's as dysfunctional as mexico is . it has a feeling of a mexican restaurant but señor frogs is in a whole different league . service has no idea what table is theirs . there ac doesn 't work . and the reason why there is always a wait is because no one gets a chance to order .
mexican	it 's disgusting . my enchiladas had no sauce and they looked like they were sitting there for days . it also made me very sick . a lot of filibertos are hit and miss . this doesn 't even deserve even 1 star . find a better location if you want filibees , or even go to del taco or taco bell if you have to , yuck .
mexican	overpriced not authentic latin food . they just smothered everything in cilantro and guacamole , terrible . there was a piece of glass in our food and the spare ribs were totally burnt . # fail
mexican	the drive thru staff is incompetent , and no matter how simple your order is they will find a way to screw it up . i live right around d the corner and this location is consistently a let down .
mexican	the food , drinks and service are all bad . it 's the kind of food that tastes low quality and you know you are going to pay for later .
mexican	don 't go here they will just waist your time got there 20 min before they closed stood at there window for a good 5min while the lady ignored me she finally asked if i wanted to order and than told me they were closed , i will never go to this place again .
mexican	this place is not worth it . at all . in any way . over priced beer , over priced food . terrible service with a frown . everything took forever to order and receive . however , the burrito i ordered was tasty .... and somewhat warm . sorry , if there was a no star vote , this gets it .
mexican	otherwise you 'll be forced to wait in the drive thru line for nothing . this happened to me multiple times .
mexican	the food sucks . tastes like bargain basement mexican food .
mexican	there 's one place in los angeles that 's worth it if you 're ever there .
mexican	had to repeat my order twice to several people only to find that they missed pieces of it when i got home . frustrated . all i really wanted was a salad and they couldn 't give me my vinaigrette .
mexican	stood in line for 15 minutes and then waited 30 minutes for our order . they couldn 't handle the volume and were more focused on the phone orders ( you could see the orders piling up on the back counter ) than the 15 customers standing in front of them waiting for their food .
mexican	biggest tourist trap w mediocre mexican food at best . definitely not worth $ 20 + for tasteless quesadillas that don 't even come w rice or beans . taco bell has more flavor than the food at this restaurant . this is also the first mexican restaurant i 've been to where they don 't offer complimentary chips and salsa .
mexican	i had the street fish tacos , they were so dry i had to order a side of sour cream and it still didn 't taste anything . my friend she had a tostada salad and it was a colorless salad she had to look for the avocado and there was barely any chicken in it . to top it all off they had forgot to throw dressing on her iceberg . worst ever !
mexican	they give you the scraps . and i wanted horchata but of course none there . they 're already kinda expensive , i at least want some horchata .
mexican	plus they charge u 50 cents more for credit cards . a waste of money $
mexican	they are seriously understaffed . the manager didn 't know how to change the syrup in the soda machine . she said she would get right on it but kept working on orders . by the time she got to the machine it became apparent she didn 't know what she was doing and would have to call the owner . meanwhile , tacos got cold and soggy . bad enough , the carne asada had run out and i got cold remnants . good bye !
mexican	it took me thirty minutes to get through the drive thru and get my food . i think that 's ridiculous ! the food was good which is why i 'm giving them two stars but the customer service was severely lacking . this location is in such a good location . if they could improve their drive thru speed and their workers ' customer service skills , i think they would be better off .
mexican	it 's not a great restaurant , food is ok , server was cold and dismissive , tables and chairs are beat up and uncomfortable , salsa is out of a can . but it is a great place to go chill and drink with friends . i had a margarita and it was good . i would come back with friends to pre game or have a night out but not for a family dinner or anything like that .
mexican	frys has 8oz for $ 1.00.taco bell is much better ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
mexican	this time wasn 't bad and last time they didn 't have my first three choices , not exaggerating . but that doesn 't explain the previous two visits . also , the prices are high , especially given my first comment . if you can hurdle both of those comments , there are lots of reasons to go to pepin . you can order sangria by the liter , my wife keeps wanting to go , they have live flamenco dancing , my wife likes the good , the ambience feels spanish , and they play upbeat flamenco music in the background .
mexican	cashier very rude i just asked for refund manager didn 't care never said sorry young kids working there . place was very dirty bad bad place
mexican	i asked for pepper jack , they gave me cheddar . i asked for bell peppers , they gave me none . i asked for vinaigrette , they gave me mayo . just go inside .
mexican	two totally different restaurants with the same name . food is extremely bland at this location , water tastes like mud , and the restaurant is filthy . chandler location is the total opposite . excellent tasting food and great atmosphere . go there instead ! !
mexican	i 've never been to such a shit slow chipotle in my life . some of the staff are nice enough , but they 're too few to make up for their slow , awful coworkers .
mexican	i waited 30 minutes at the drive thru , and they got my order wrong . once you 're boxed in , you can 't leave , you 'll have to wait . never again !
mexican	i been here twice and both experiences not impressed . i went there yesterday and it took 25 minutes to get just two quesadillas and they barely had any cheese in them . i asked to speak to the manager and he / she had me waiting another 5 minutes to where i didn 't even bother and left . will not be back ever again ! i can get better food and service at filiberto 's or los favs 's and cheaper . it 's overrated . if i could i 'd give half a star i would .
mexican	wish i had checked yelp before we walked from terminal c over to terminal d. this einstein location should be closed . bagels were soggy , not toasted properly , and were schmeered with the smallest possible spread of cream cheese . instead of the reliably good einstein experience , we were sorely disappointed and a bit grossed out . sorry , but you may have to settle for starbucks or burger king .
mexican	service is good but the food us pretty terrible . the only person to like their food was eating the chimichanga . tacos are awful .
mexican	just don 't . cheese enchiladas with cold shredded cheese , swimming in rank sauce . thirty dollars for two to eat disgusting cold fast food . go to taco bell at least you expect bad and it is a lot cheaper
mexican	how does a taco bar run out of cheese and rice 2 hours before closing in the middle of the vegas strip . i repeat . don 't , just don 't
mexican	went their saturday night not crowded we ordered our food 50 minutes later still no food . it was funny 4 people were working there all were in the back for the last 20 minutes never saw our waitress again .
mexican	i know several people who will not go on his shift . very condescending & rude . i heard the manager has a thing for him . so i guess his behavior is acceptable .
mexican	went here because the yelp page said they close at 11 only to see everyone in the back , cleaning up already . i get it can be slow but change the hours then if that 's the case . instead , i just got a blank , annoyed stare from the employees inside who clearly saw me , for coming by 30 minutes before closing . no words other than lazy come to mind .
mexican	we tried to go on the fourth of july , and knowing they might not be open called first . they said they were closing early at 1 : 00 , but when we got there at 12 : 05 they had already closed . disappointing .
mexican	slow and bad service , food quality is bad for price , chilaquiles plate and tamal were super greasy and beans were cold , had to ask them to reheat . food was bland . this is far from authentic mexican food . i 'm not going back to this place .
mexican	no ac , out of all fountain drink except diet which was flat . there was a sewer smell in the back dinning area . and was out of chicken only shredded and they got order wrong i know we are not coming back .
mexican	i rather go a couple miles down the road to isabella amore for better food and salsa for a similar price and bigger portion .
mexican	don 't know the difference between their grilled chicken and shredded chicken - waste of money as they didn 't get the order right ( and yes we specified the grilled chicken and it says so on the receipt ) - let us know if you want our address to send us a refund ( right ) .
mexican	yea good price for a quick bite , maybe if you 're drunk and starving they are good but i can think of far more places with wayyy better tacos .
mexican	had fish tacos today for lunch and they were bland - like having fish & chips on a tortilla , except the fish in real fish & chips is better . also had soup - chicken & jalapeno ; also boring , though better when we added some of the corn relish and some bottled hot sauce . everything needed salt - and more flavor . and what 's up with no salsa on the table , just a corn & tomato relish ? which was mostly corn . my fish tacos are way better ! can 't believe guy fieri liked this place - he usually has better taste . won 't go there again .
mexican	the meat was burnt on one of my tacos and everything was just poor quality , the service was great though , but will think long and hard before returning here .
mexican	there is never enough food ready for service and there always seems to be too many people trying to serve . went last night and there wasn 't enough food ready to serve so my burrito bowl was more like a burrito cup . really disappointed in the food . the servers were trying really hard but that does not make up for poor food and reduces portions .
mexican	the meat they are using is something different . it 's cheaper and the texture is noticeably different , so , the flavor is obviously different . i can 't get over it but people that have been here for awhile don 't seem to notice ... even mexicans that have lived here for many years ... they lose their own taste to authentic flavor . and for 9-10 bucks per burrito ? ? ? yeah ... no thanks .
mexican	i had tried it a while back and it was mediocre and the second time was just enough to get me by .
mexican	beans and rice tasted bland like from a can . chips and salsa tasted like they came from a bag and bottle from the store . the burrito itself was okay nothing great . service was horrible , the server was not friendly or attentive . only saw him once and it took a while to get the check . we actually had to get up and poke our head in the kitchen .
mexican	don 't know what was in the food , but i had the worst stomach issues after eating here .
mexican	my wife and i tried it and got some enchiladas and a tostada to go . the cook was back there with no gloves on and wiping his hands on his apron continually . the enchiladas hardly had any meat in it and had mostly strips of green bell pepper in it . then where the sauces are it was filthy . crap everywhere . told the counter person and he acted like who cares . am reporting this place to the health department .
mexican	drinks are good ... food not so much . i get it they 've been around for ages but why not spruce up the menu with some quality ingredients . if you 're messing up tacos you know you 're doomed .
mexican	mediocre food and horrible service . we sat at the bar most recently this past week and let me just say the bartenders were much more interested in chatting with each other than getting the free chips and salsa ( had to ask even after we ordered ) , had to beg for more alocohol - what is the problem are we interupting your social hours guys ? ? ? ! blah - i got fish tacos and they were fine - really i could have saved a lot of money heading to taco bell and get a six pack of heiny instead of putting up with the aggravation of trying to eat here !
mexican	you get what you pay for and it 'll have its revenge . the tacos were flavorless and topped with some weird cheese sauce . not too authentic .
mexican	the truck is very dirty . the service was just as bad and i won 't be getting tacos from here and i would recommend anyone who sees this truck at a food truck lineup to stay away as well . dirty workspace , bad food , rude workers , terrible experience !
mexican	food is great but i 've been to a few cafe rio 's and they all have great food . they all are consistently good . this cafe rio in particular is horrible . they have horrible service . every time i go i consistently order $ 50 - $ 60 of food . they have screwed up my order everytime .
mexican	terrible food and terrible service . go down the street to la carnita instead .
mexican	while at the check out window , the cacher / server was anything but nice . after taking our sizable meal down the road to grind . with each undressing of the wrapper revealed that we were in for one terrible meal . chicken soft tacos that looked like made in a nuclear reactor , to the soupy quesadilla that we tried desperately to keep from staining our pants . everything lacked any of that quick efficient tasty chow that i know dt is capable of making . my poor buddies guts were absolutely trashed for the remainder of the day . shame on you lazy dt cooks ..... shame on you !
mexican	don 't like the food at all , waste of money super super bad food don 't taste mexican at all !
mexican	i gave it a few tries and i came to the conclusion that this place is just horrible . whenever i come in here , it seems so chaotic behind the counter that it seems like they rush you . i prefer chipotle or qdoba instead .
mexican	it may be a different type of mexican food , but they don 't serve salsa with the chips , don 't serve cheese crisps , the food that i did order was almost tasteless . when i walked in - smelled like a fish fry gone bad . won 't go back here if they paid me . just don 't like this type of mexican food . very different from macayo 's type of restaurants i understand .
mexican	i give them a chance every now and then cause they are close to my house but i always regret it . waste of money honestly , the only good part is the salsa bar . if you want good mexican food go to rivas it 's honestly the best mexican food in vegas . rivas uses quality meats and ingredients and everything on the menu is delicious especially if you like steak fries i promise eat there once and you 'll never go back to roberto 's .
mexican	" i asked for simple changes and the incompetent staff could not accommodate . i didn 't ask for anything other than taco shells ... no go . when i called to ask why i didn 't get them i got a " oh , it 's not extra , i just forgot to put them in . it will still be good . just no taco shells .... " wth ? ! ?
mexican	if i 'm gonna eat a burrito or taco , i 'm thinking l.a. taco truck style . this is more what i 'd call texmex . lettuce , tomato , guac , and sour cream on the burrito . the carne asada doesn 't taste like it 's been marinated . don 't get me wrong , it didn 't stop me from eating plenty ! ( see photo i submitted of steve r. ' s arm next to the big burrito ) i 'm rating it 2.5 stars but rounding down to 2 . i will be trying it again .
mexican	don 't not eat here they hack your bank , they need to fix this and the food was gross the service was horrible you have better luck somewhere else
mexican	we went on a friends recommendation who went a day earlier , they had a great time but our experience was completely opposite . the chips and guacamole were awesome but everything went sharply downhill after that . we waited about 45 minutes for our food ( after finally complaining to the waitress and getting an eyeroll our food came out immediately ) . the food was mainly cold and the steak fajitas were rubbery . we all ate about half our plates and decided it was time for the check . the restaurant was empty and waitress was nowhere to be seen for most of the night . oh well .
mexican	it 's $ 6.00 . same price as the beer ! the pasole tasted old . the music is so loud you can 't talk with anyone . they 're not sure if it 's a restaurant or club ? ?
mexican	they are over charged . $ 5.00 per tostada and then the ceviche is hardly even there . its mostly onion , celery and tomato . not what it used to be before . quality in this restaurant has fallen a lot within the last year . i work walking distance and our office would buy meals all the time for our meetings . today was the last time we buy anything from here . " the economic kitchen " is not so economica anymore . i rather go to filiberto 's and expect that quality , then surprises at economica .
mexican	plain tortilla with chicken , and cheese just thrown on it , not at all like i get when dining in . will only be eating at the restaurant from now on if i return .
mexican	they are way overpriced & no alcohol ! food was just ok- nothing special at all ! ! won 't be back here . yuk !
mexican	if you do check it before you leave . had five orders when we got home it 's like we had two and a half . stingy on everything but the lettuce . couldn 't get the orders correct either .
mexican	just go in . my boyfriend just picked up our food after ordering online and the order is wrong , it 's missing all the pico and lettuce and good side stuff we asked for and my food is cold . i 'm super disappointed because i love the barbocoa burritos .
mexican	my husband picked up our dinner order for us and had to wait because they did not have white rice ready so they didn 't have our order made for our pick up time . after waiting for them to have rice to make my burrito bowl , he brings it home only to open it and have the order be 100 % wrong . apparently having the ingredients written on the order ticket is too hard for this location . only go in person unless you want to eat someone else 's meal .
mexican	messed up my order 3 separate times and it makes no sense to drive back there . just make my order right the first time . john the cashier please take note if you 're reading this i will not hesitate to contact district and file a formal complaint . 3 times is too many screw ups and i , or any other consumer should not have to accept this .
mexican	.. they seem to lose track of their online orders and they never have group orders ready before you show up to pau , even with a given pick up time . this is the 3rd , maybe 4th , time this has happened to us for our work lunches . shame on them now ...
mexican	first of all its not flatbread . it 's made with a tortialla . it 's basically an open quesadilla . when i asked the waiter about it he has no idea about what he was serving .
mexican	crap ! ! ! tamales , ok ! my friends told me it wasn 't that expensive , well i paid almost $ 40 for an order of 6 tamales , 1 soup and a drink .
mexican	don 't order the steak fajitas .i 've had more meat stuck between my teeth from a big mac than that was given to me on my plate !
mexican	just a tortilla with cheese and lettuce . i would have been happy with taco bell quesadilla and packaged sauce instead of this . i was surely disappointed by my decision to eat here . i had ordered that day 's special dish ( very cheap ) . i was not very hungry . i would not recommend this place to anyone ( or anyone vegetarian ) .
mexican	the food here is good . the burrito is large with a lot of meat . like some of the other reviews it is the customer service that needs help . the lack of customer service . i am going to repeat another reviewer " the people that take your order are always in a bad mood and they appear as if taking your order is a favor they are doing you . " pay attention don tortaco and improve your customer service skills .
mexican	that 's just when they lock the doors and turn off the registers . they stop serving food at some impossible-to-guess randomly-selected time prior to their closing time when they turn off their oven .
mexican	also didn 't appreciate being called a pinche guerro when i came back in to get the right order . i just got my money back instead due to their attitude and refusing to replace my 15 minute old order with fresh food . find another taco shop . there are 2 within a mile of this one . do yourself a favor and go there instead .
mexican	meats is not made like carne asada is more like boiled grilled . water so nasty n she wanted to charge me to change my water . i didnt like water down pineapple . so please dont go
mexican	cool place but for drinks only . chips were stale , guacamole wasn 't good , and tacos were cold and not exciting . there a lot better places for tacos . service was ok ... slow and our server wasn 't very knowledgable about the food .
mexican	save your money . we ordered carne asada burritos and i should 've just asked for my money back . the tortilla was so hard , the carne asada looked and tasted like it had been reheated over 3 times easily . we also ordered chicken strips from the kids menu and let me tell you those were not chicken strips . the french fries didn 't really even look cooked . if i could give it 0 stars i would . i will not be back and i definitely suggest you go elsewhere . just don 't .
mexican	only a manager can approve it but none was there . oh yea watch out for beggars everywhere
mexican	bartender walked by me several times and looked right at me .. said nothing . .i finally had to ask for water and a menu . .bar had like 5 people
mexican	do yourself a favor a drive to the 67th ave kfc or taco bell . at least you will feel good about not making a bad decision .
mexican	for someone who was ordering a surprise lunch pickup from south carolina , that was not helpful
mexican	every single thing you want is extra charge ! for sauce , cheese , etc are all extra charge . not worth the price , might as well go to chipotle and get extra of everything . staff weren 't the nicest either
mexican	dry and plain . i chose it because it said " voted best in vegas " but that 's hard to believe . i eventually asked for limes and the pointed me out to where the lemons are ... i follow her back to the cashier and it took them awhile to get it to me but whatever .
mexican	rush , rush , rush - get out the door we want to go home .
mexican	it smells divine when you walk in though that is for sure . ordered the organic agave margarita - good drink but the appetizer ( shrimp brochette ) was only meh and my grilled fish tacos ( yellow tail ) were not good - fish was dry and i like some mango or pineapple type sauce with it to counteract the savory fish - overall ok but won 't be back .
mexican	mad mex is ok at best . service was poor and slow , unappetixing platings , food was not great . everything tastes like it was cooked with beer . if you want mexican , save time and money by going to taco bell . the food quslity is similar
mexican	maybe it 's just this location . maybe it was an off night . but it was my first time having chipotle and i have 0 desire to get it again . steak burrito was bland and pretty small for the price . fat bastard is lightyears ahead . burrito boyz , mucho burrito , even taco bell or taco del mar i enjoy more than what i had here . staff were friendly at the very least .
mexican	they are pretty bland with no pop for a place that has mexico and korean flavors . anyway the toppings were fresh which is good and their salsas were good too . i just expected more taste in the fish and batter . waitress was friendly and i appreciate that .
mexican	waited 15 mins just to order and another 30 for the food to be ready . we had looked at the menu ahead of time online just to be told that we couldn 't order the items listed online . when we got our food it was cold . my burrito was so poorly wrapped that you couldn 't even pick it up . the only reason the carne asada had any flavor at all is because it had so much salt on it . i do not recommend this place .
mexican	starch texture , my kids refuse to finish them , i gave them two stars only because their chips and salsa are good .
mexican	didn 't eat so can 't tell u about food . never got that far .
mexican	this place is anything but fast . drive thru was packed so i came inside to order . 20 minutes later myself and 10 other people are still waiting for our orders . seems very disorganized . does not seem understaffed as 2 workers behind the counter are just standing there looking around .
mexican	honestly , it is better than taco bell but falls short of los tacos and tacos el gordo by a long shot . great seating and looks very clean but the meat was luke warm and the guacamole was flavorless , if not unappetizing . the mexican street corn was pretty beat as well--cattle corn boiled too long and again kept luke warm . i am a huge fan of mexican food and this place has been disappointing both times i have come . the price point is also relatively high to other great taco restaurants . i gave them 2 stars purely for the cleanliness .
mexican	you are going to throw all your food away cause their will be hair in your food . guaranteed
mexican	service is blah and food is nothing special . their happy hour food is a joke . one star for the beer and one star for their free chips and salsa .
mexican	i got steak fajitas but didn 't come with cheese / guac / sour cream . i had to spit out the meat because it was fatty . came with a salad but it consisted of was lettuce / no dressing . the salsa was awful
mexican	run by this place and don 't look back . the worst mexican food in phoenix . absolutely no flavor . the only thing going for it is the friendly wait staff .
mexican	the only reason i give 2 stars is because the nachos were actually good , not amazing but good . the service sucked as it took them about 10 mins to come over and take a drink order , another 15 to bring us our tap water . the entrees were really bad , the burrito was made of the cheapest ground beef you can imagine , the chicken in the quesdillas were so dry , tasteless and had no flavor as was the shrimp in the shrimp tacos . our entire group bit their food once , then paid and left . no one literally ate more the one bite .
mexican	don 't waste stomach space on maria2 in an area this full of tasty restaurants ... sugary margaritas , sloppily presented meals , stale chips ... you can do better ...
mexican	the food is very greasy and nothing so fresh . you may end up with a bad indigestion so be careful whaf u order . the sides taste outta of a old can so nothing even close to " home-made " ; first tried salvadorian cuisine in phx and probably last .
mexican	dont waste ur time here , they will get ur order wrong and as much time as it takes for you to get ur food ( its a what the fuck moment ) its ridiculous .
mexican	you can to robertos and get the same thing . it taste way better at robertos and half the price !
mexican	flavorless , dry , bland food . $ 18.00 for a carne plate with beans n rice plus 2 tacos .
mexican	go anywhere else ! i am a lover of mexican food and have never had a bad experience at any mexican restaurant ever ! i have been here twice and both times the food is so unappetizing and the workers are so rude .. worst mexican place i have ever been to ! will never return .
mexican	the food is average , and there 's a roberto 's right across the street , so go to them . this place has forgotten my jarritos soda three times when i order to go , and when i go back to get it , they give me the hardest time for a freaking $ 2 soda . the orders have been incomplete a couple of times also . their customer skills are almost nonexistent .
mexican	i ordered the chicken burrito and threw most of it in the trash . service was also extremely slow ... good thing i wasn 't in a hurry to catch my flight .
mexican	ordered take out of taquitos , guacamole , mini chimichangas & mexican pizza & it was $ 40 ! we thought for that price , servings would be huge- nope . 2 small taquitos & 4 super mini chimichangas , which was only two split in half & each was bite size and dried out . mexican pizza was big , but tortilla was soggy & chicken wasn 't great . guac was the only thing ok , but certainly not worth $ 10 . lesson learned - will not be going back .
mexican	had worst experience here . my order was wrong twice after waiting almost a half hour for two tacos . then when letting manager know , he gave me attitude . i don 't pay to have someone insult my intelligence and doubt anyone else would . i suggest going to taco bell .
mexican	super disappointed . horrible service , food less then mediocre . there were only 6 tables , i had to bus my table . we were only non-white people , not sure if that was factor . taco plate definitely not worth $ 11 . we ordered chicken tacos , veggie tacos , green chile burger and flautas . so , we tried a variety of items . not a lot to choose from . not worth it . go somewhere else .
mexican	tacos sucked , they use mozzarella on their tacos which is stupid . they messed up my order after reading it back twice , one while placing it and another when i picked it up . there were two good things : my refund and the guac . hasta luego para siempre !
mexican	if i could rate a minus i would . horrible service .
mexican	my water with a lemon squeeze was more flavorful than the margarita .... no bueno ! ..... decided to leave and drove down the street to los sombreros . yea ! , we were very pleased . great margarita ! the atmosphere was pleasant and quiet
mexican	there food preparation is horrible . my jr . whooper looks all messy and fries was not fresh it was cold and dry . they also forgot my straw . i ordered from the drive thru .
mexican	horrible , over priced food ! i ordered the steak ( ok ) burrito , with black beans ( bland ) , lime rice ( awful awful awful ) , and cheese . there is a $ 1 upcharge for a spoonful of regular salsa . ( that 's like charging $ 1 for ketchup when you order fries ) the margaritas are a joke , i don 't think there was any alcohol in ours . i can 't believe this horrible place is located in the mgm grand .
mexican	not only is the food cold and greasy , but also disgusting . who ' fixes ' cold food by throwing it in the deep fryer for a second time ? cook up a new plate instead .
mexican	they don 't want your money either by the way they act . most times they are out of basic items a mexican grill should have like guacamole , avocado , lettuce , pico , or sour cream at least that 's what was included in meal that i did not get . young kids don 't care your paying 20 bucks for 10 worth of food they don 't even make correctly . ask for a tortilla on the side , nah you can 't have that . don 't go here , literally anywhere else you will have a better time .
mexican	beans and rice were the most unflavored i 've ever had , the chips taste like they are from food lion , the salsa is watered down , the pico had no taste , the sweet tea looked like water , the fajitas both steak and chicken had absolutely no seasoning and the meat was overcooked . on top of that the " manager / cook " was super rude when we told her about the quality of the food . never again !
mexican	customer service is " 0 " bellow any expectations . never again farmers boys burgers lesson learned the hard way .
mexican	have eaten at other guy fieri establishments . he would be disappointed ! after a 30 minute wait with a ton of open tables at prime dinner time . ordered the drunken tacos and the jicama salad . the salad was great but the shrimp was cold and chewy . 3 shrimp for the $ 6 upcharge . the fish on the drunken tacos was way over cooked . my husband couldn 't even finish the meal . the rice was cold and the canned beans were tasteless . the server did take the tacos off our bill . so many better places to eat in vegas .
mexican	sometimes i wonder how ampm gets their employees . bunch of ignorant uneducated cashiers that hate their life . can you blame them thou ?
mexican	there is a senor taco that is less expensive and way better . the food here is so salty and gross . i don 't know why we thought it would be a good idea to come here . the rice was good and the service was ok .
mexican	the pork and fish tacos are very bland and the ground meat has little seasoning . the service was good , but the place was empty
mexican	food was horrible and not as described by the cashier . manager could care less .
mexican	pass the " ambiance " and keep driving ! horrible service . we sat outside for 20 min w / o any acknowledgement . had to move tables because roaches were crawling all over the wall and seat cushion . should of been a good to sign to leave . food came and was the worst ever . we ended up not even takin a second bite . took the left over to go and headed downtown a s gave them to a homeless person ! ! to finally get my taco fix i drove to the strip for a hole in the way real taco spot ! ! i 've never been so dissatisfied ! ! enough to sign up for yelp just to leave this review
mexican	ordered fajitas and the onions were raw ! chicken was bland no flavor . the rice tasted like something out of a box minus the salt . we will never go back . you think phoenix would have great mexican food but i can 't seem to find any .
mexican	the menu states guacamole and refried beans . instead all three orders on my table came w / o guacamole and a bed of rice . asking the waiter if there was something missing she said no . when i asked about guacamole she said she could bring me some . that 's fishy . and the price tag for the dish : $ 16 . so if you are craving mex go to edgar tacos 4 blocks down . you won 't regret .
mexican	don 't waste your time or money ! ! ! i wouldn 't go back if the food was free . bad service and even worse food ! only the cheese crisp is worth trying . salsa was bad , chimichanga was horrible , beans were slop , rice was dry and crunchy . nobody in our group enjoyed the experience . couldn 't even get a refill of water , and they were not very busy . should have know . no wait and plenty of open tables normally m and no repeat customers . not real sure how they stay in business ....
mexican	with so many good restaurants and bars to choose from in vegas , do yourself a favor and go anywhere else but here . steak burrito arrived pretty much cold ; small $ 8 beer started semi-cold but was warm in a few minutes since it was served in a cheap plastic cup . $ 55 for a cold burrito , warm beer , salad and an iced tea - give me a break !
mexican	the server is the worst i 've ever had in az and only 3 tables seated in the entire restaurant . we could have overlooked if the food was good but it was horrible other than the salsa . the shrimp was so overlooked and dried out i had to ask for a sauce to even eat it . it was way over priced too . no appetizer 4 meals a $ 60 groupon and still $ 20 more !
mexican	the service sinks . had to ask for basic things 2-3 times . the wood benches and chairs are the most uncomfortable thing i have ever sat on . our plates , glasses and silverware were dirty . didn 't look like they had been put in the dishwasher . the food was terrible ! low quality tortillas , no filling in the tacos , anything overly spicy . definitely a big disappointment . won 't be going back .
mexican	went last friday and it was practically empty inside at 7 : 00 pm ! my fish taco was good , shrimp taco was ok . husband didn 't like his burrito at all - too salty ! guacamole was good but not better than what i could make at home ( for less than $ 6.50 ) . we won 't be going back ! but glad we at least had a " buy one entree get one entree free " coupon ! !
mexican	i ended up here because barros shut down . large 2 topping at barros is $ 13 . here it is $ 25 .
mexican	the refried beans tasted sour , the chalupa was soggy on one side , the chimichanga had the toughest chicken i have ever experienced . the best thing about my meal was the glass of water .
mexican	small portions and a rude staff . my children only get meat cheese and lettuce on their burrito . heaven forbid you ask for extra ground beef , since you aren 't getting rice beans salsa etc. they won 't give it to you . save your time and go to chipotle !
mexican	taco bell or del taco has better and cheaper food .
mexican	this was quite bland for mexican food and i was so disappointed . i got a carnitas , carne asada & pollo taco and none of them warranted more than a couple of stars . also , my grandfather had the fish taco and it was very " crispy . " and by crispy i mean burnt to a barely edible level . i 'd recommend another joint .
mexican	what mexican restaurant runs out of sour cream ? oh wait , the guy seated next to me and he had sour cream . the lady taking my order was positive they were out of sour cream but wasn 't , but by the time i saw my neighbor sit down with his meal and had sourcream on his plate , mine was halfway done . the food was on the cold side and not all that good . it was overpriced . keep walking .
mexican	not the best tacos . they do not provide extra salsa .. authentic yes ! cheap maybe !
mexican	always something wrong with this location , will not be eating here anymore .
mexican	do expect the curb girls to have the manager wrapped around their finger do smile because what other option do you have
mexican	the only people who come here are losers who think they are cool , people looking for a fight , and people who just turned 21 . the place is dirty and the staff is rude . the bouncers think they rule the world and if you 're not a " regular , " they hassle you . god forbid you hold your beer bottle in a way that they don 't like . listen up peeps - do yourselves a favor and pass this place up ! meeting behind the dumpster with a bottle of tequila would be better than going inside this dump . never again dos gringos ! ! ! !
mexican	expensive with small , poor quality portions & you don 't even want to know what i found en el bano . i really wanted it to be good .
mexican	first off i 'm mexican and in no way does this food taste authentic . the tacos were dry and the the mix paloma drink was awful . this place honestly makes roberto 's taco shop seem delicious . save yourself the trouble and just go to firefly . the food may be expensive there but at least the ceviche they make will be 10 times better than at this place .
mexican	i got a bowl full of white and brown lettuce . the burrito we ordered was soggy and contained everything but chicken - although we ordered a chicken burrito . all the tables in the restaurant were dirty . i really truly wish that the food looked as presentable as it does on all the commercials and the ads . what you actually get is slop .
mexican	i was scammed out of 4 pieces of chicken with my order and i never got a receipt ! ! ! ! i didn 't realize until i drove home from this location ! ! ! not cool !
mexican	chile relleno fair but can get better at filiburto 's. ordered a beef tostada but waitress must have misunderstood and i got a bean tostada . cold and bland . prices were low but i won 't be back .
mexican	told waiter and he did nothing . he did not appear to notify cook . he did not take it off the bill , nor did he apologize . for the those who don 't know , a rock in pintos indicates poor food prep , and can lead to a cracked tooth . boooooo . this is a real shame because otherwise , i have loved every dish and every visit to sabor queretano .
mexican	downloaded the app says i get a free taco , lady at drive thru said it didn 't work for anything even though my app coupon says it 's good until 10 / 25 / 17 ... lady is a dumbass wasted a perfectly good coupon ... and why advertise if you 're not gonna hold true
mexican	the chips were not hot n crispy , they were plain and almost stale . tasted like the cheapest tortilla chips ever ; mission is better . bean dip was flavorless paste . tasted like cheap canned salsa . made the mistake of ordering nachos .. the guacamole had big aweful tasting hard chunks in it . the sampler plater had a nasty dip but i have no idea what it was . maybe cheese ? maybe spinach ? gross gross gross . we didn 't like anything except the margarita . we left all of our leftovers . never going back . ever
mexican	the staff constantly stared at us like were from mars and different , no smiles or thank yous just stares . worst experience ever . and an a awful feeling . we never went back now i know what racism feels like . terrible feeling also hurts too .
mexican	do you like chipotle but hate when it gets a little too tasty ? then try panchero 's !
mexican	either they don 't throw out the chicken thats expired or they by almost expired chicken and dont use it in time . food suppliers have specific dates of expiration on chicken . el pollo loco is too good for that lol respect the chicken ? no , respect the health dept
mexican	do you like odd tasting watered down margaritas and mediocre food ? well i 've found the perfect place for you .
mexican	if i chopped up a slim jim and threw it in a tortilla i would have been more satisfied i would give zero stars if possible * *
mexican	tacos are basic , nothing impressive and definitely not worth it . i would not recommend
mexican	there is usually little veto no lines in this place but you will always have to wait for the simplest orders . the cashiers are always screwing around on their phones which they have laying on the register in full view . the place sucks . drive over the bridge and get chic film a because their service is much better and you don 't have to hear employees swearing or using racial slurs .
mexican	and a super noisy environment with a wait staff that barely comes to your table ? well my friends you have come across just the place to waste your money . honestly take the trip to rosaritas beach taco shop on horizon ridge this place sucks . two times i have given it a shot both times same results . but i suppose the veiw is worth taking a date here for drinks , other than that stay away from this restaurant .
mexican	located conveniently next to the ghetto , this is the place where the employees like making you wait approximately 15 minutes for one taco ! so stop by now and grab some tacos to poison your loved ones with !
mexican	do you remember how pancho 's used to taste ? keep that memory and don 't go again .
mexican	do your intestines need a workout ? do you miss your toilet and would like to spend some quality time with it ? well ....... come to carambas !
mexican	yes , for a limited time only we can pummel your digestive system with 2 pounds of slop that we like to call the wet burrito ! thats not all folks ! throw in a plastic bowl of stale chips and day old salsa and you 're in for a real treat !
mexican	the chips are fried in peanut oil , which leaves a horrible aftertaste . the machaca chimichanga i had was just shredded beef with canned green chilis added and a quart of sour cream on top . my wife had the baja chicken chimi , it came with a whole brick of very salty cream cheese on top . i feel like i want to throw up just thinking about it . very disappointed . next time we 'll go across the street to don lencho 's !
mexican	after waiting a full 15 minutes for my order i get home only to realize that they did not give me my fries they added tomato when i requested no tomato and the meat is cold . oh and my little sister would like for me to add that they didn 't give cherries in our milkshakes ! i can 't believe i skipped on in and out to come get some carl 's jr .
mexican	food was not up to par and even a couple days old . everything tasted like it was out of the can and the margarita was all sweet and sour . do your self a favor and don 't go to baja miguel 's . we both got sick : (
mexican	terribly overpriced , my order was wrong , food was lukewarm , and had to ask for a glass of water 3 times - and finally received it in a dirty glass . go somewhere else !
mexican	it is one of the worst meals i have had in a long time . the food is low quality and poor tasting . i love mexican food , love it and i could take only a few bites . my husband felt the same way about his meal . unlike other reviews , we found the staff friendly and once it was apparent we weren 't eating the manager came to see if there was anything she could do , offered another meal from the menu . she tried but we just wanted to get out of there . plenty of restaurants on carson street , don 't pick this one .
mexican	this location is abysmal in terms of cleanliness , efficiency , worker attitude , etc .
mexican	i have no idea how they got the experience so wrong here . great location . great facility . nowhere near the quality of food as their mesa location . i hope they get this fixed soon . we love backyard taco but this location is .. meh .
mexican	do yourself a favor and save your money you 'll thank me for this anytime i 've ever eat roberto 's i wake up the next day feeling like i ate a bowling ball the food is always tremendously greasy they do a decent late night crowd but its all the drunks trying to ward off a hangover i recommend you go to fausto 's instead much better food
mexican	if this is upscale you must be joking . we ate here when it first open and it was quality food . now is got a bull ring shitty food , dirty glasses , bad service and the most annoying loud music playing at noon when most people are trying to nurse a hang over . i see this place closing very soon . so many better places to eat and much better mexican food . try the restaurant in tivoli if you was fresh quality upscale mexican . this place gets uck and double uck .
mexican	go to the charleston one . there was a hair in my food , a piece of avocado peel in my friend 's and the ceviche was just too salty to eat . our waitress was nice , that is the only good thing i can say about this place .
mexican	if you want tasty food , more authentic tasty food , and if you want to spend about 1 / 3 of what you 'll spend at joyride ... then keep driving .
mexican	listen to all your customers on yelp and change ! ! complete and utter laziness . this place could be so great open 24 / 7 , has a nice drive through . pat down the oil how difficult is that . recently ordered a california burrito , high quality ingredients but oil was seeping out the bottom . had to stop halfway through because i was so disgusted with myself . my plate upon stopping ( because i can 't say finishing ) looked like the black sea so much oil . change people change ! will not be retuning until i see change .
mexican	tapas are not meant to be mass produced . dates , chicken tinga empanadas and baked goat cheese were good . the rest were truly mediocre ... pulpo , papas bravas , garlic shrimp , pork empanadas , etc. skip this one !
mexican	came in before 8pm , had to wait 15 minutes for a table in a near-empty restaurant . we ordered , and waited 45 minutes ; we were finally served , with a few dishes ignored and the rest cold . 5 minutes later , bright spotilights came up so that they could start cleaning up . we asked the speak to the manager , who had the lights lowered slightly . she also comped one drink on a $ 130 + bill . particularly unappetizing was the $ 29 molcajete de mariscos , which was a shallow bowl of gummy overcooked riced with a thin covering of fish and a few shrimps .
mexican	won 't be going back ever again . epic fail 3 times in a row . only positive is their patio .
mexican	got carne asada tacos for lunch on a monday around noon . the free chips and salsa are great , but the carne asada tacos i ordered were just chunks on meat in a warm tortilla . there was no seasoning and the meat was tough . there was supposed to be pico de gallo on top which turnout out to be 2 small flakes of tomato . no good .
mexican	please , do yourself the favor and go to nando 's ! ! ! ughhhhhh ....
mexican	food came out uncooked , slow service . server tried to tell me thats how it is. really you serve mexican food with cheese that isn 't melted ? no visit from a manager or anything. this is a place in need of a visit from restaurant impossible . i won 't be going back .
mexican	food is consistently horrible . i decided to give their tacos another shot and they were even worse than the first time . i can whip up something more flavorful in my kitchen .
mexican	friendly staff . wouldn 't recommend to eat here . ordered carnitas tacos that had very little meat in it .
mexican	very inconsiderate , chatting with eachother while there 's a long line of customers .
mexican	beware ! ! ! i 'm a lightweight and wanted one good drink . it would take me 10 more to feel buzz 'd ... maybe that 's the catch to their selling more drinks . could be an ultra-bottom shelf alcohol also . food was eh .... fajitas were blah . could have been better . i 'm visiting . won 't be back when i come back .
mexican	the tacos .. fish taco and the shrimp diablo wer pretty bad . a child could have done a better job of cooking . .i ordered the tortilla soup .. dont waste you time as it arrived luke warm at best .. tasted like leftover salsal was added , sprinkled with cheese and delivered to the table . service was pleasant but slow . never again will i visit this place !
mexican	the lack of stars is due to the lackluster mexican food : pollo crema was basically strong goat cheese sauce on top of extra dry grilled chicken with undercooked rice , the burrito was a handful of raw spinach or lettuce wrapped in a flour tortilla , the queso could have been melted down cheese spray , and the $ 30 hanger steak was chewy and boring . although i 'd return for drinks with friends , i would never come back for food due to the lack of flavor and poor execution as well as the fact that it took 40 + minutes to get the food we wished we never ordered .
mexican	blue hair lady socializes for too long while a line of people want to check out . and when you buy water because of and advertised deal they don 't alert the customer that it 's only good with a store card . i 'll be avoiding this location like the plague because of the attitude and pride in ripping off a customer that they can laugh about . go anywhere but here .
mexican	tacos were tasty but , taquito size not taco size . no sides . bartender did not want to be there and it showed in service or lack there of . hope your not too thirsty or hungry . they need to hire a mexican cook to show them how to roast a pepper and peel the bitter skin before putting it into a taco too !
mexican	food was overrated and over priced . i really do not understand the raving reviews regarding the shrimp and lobster quesadilla . mediocre is being generous . firecracker shrimp was decent . not sure if i will return based on the food . outside enclosed patio area is super cute though .
mexican	serves at a point was food but not enough . waitingn for our food to come to the table for 45 mins . when we got our food the food was cold . they took the food back they brought another plate but meat looked old . never coming back .
mexican	change your hours on yelp ! so stupid to provide false info !
mexican	placed my order online and went in at my pickup time . place is nicely decorated and clean . larger than expected . knew right away i made a mistake when i walked in and there was only one other person there on a friday night at 6p . didn 't have my order ready and didn 't even start it till i arrived . live 3 min away and when i got home the meat in the pork taco was cold . food was very difficult to swallow and barely made it through a taco . ordered churros too ... how do you mess up a churro ? wouldn 't eat here again nor would i recommend to others .
mexican	staff could also up their customer service skills . if you don 't like undercooked potatoes , make sure to ask for none in your burrito . also , they didn 't ask if i wanted salsa , they just put red salsa in my bag and i wanted green , too . i asked for some .
mexican	my last drive through visit took 18 minutes with only 3 cars in line . i complained through corporate website and received free whopper coupons . oh joy . tonight i thought i would try again ... asked for a whopper w / no tomato , add cheese and bacon which was repeated back to me , on the the receipt and charged for . i get home , guess what ? no cheese , no bacon but i did get those tomatoes ! don 't ever plan on going back there .
mexican	me : ok , can i have two chicken avocado burritos ? worker : we have enough chicken for one burrito . if you 're called pollo loco , plan ahead and don 't run out of the pollo . at the very least , open the dialogue with " welcome to pollo loco , we are out of chicken , sorry " good luck ordering from a menu that is 95 % chicken . beyond disappointed tonight . went to don tortaco instead and i 'm glad they 're just across the street !
mexican	only thing girl said to me was " here " when she handed me the food . 5 / 10 / 16 @ 8pm .
mexican	i 'm sitting here right now . it 's been about 15 min already . they get on the speaker and the first thing they say is hold on , we need to help customers inside first . i 'm 99 % sure i 've been waiting longer than the people inside . what 's the point of a drive through if it 's 10x faster to just go inside ? ?
mexican	egg shells in my carne asada burroito after i waited forever : (
mexican	it 's a friday at 11 : 30 , but it 's still fast food . gave me the wrong order , which isn 't a big deal . luckily i checked before pulling completely away form the window . they took the bag back and relaxed the incorrect items .. it was still wrong lol . everyone makes mistakes but on top of service being blah and the wait being so long .. yeah .. not a happy customer .
mexican	i mean . how hard is it to listen . and if you don 't understand , ask again ? keep asking for things on my order and not receiving them . keep stealing money from me zaxbys and you 'll be losing a customer .
mexican	does that warrant a one-star ? i dunno , it 's just stoopid .
mexican	both very small and simple , with one car in the drive thru other than myself . what a joke .
mexican	drive-thru employee is rude and didn 't get my order right even though i repeated it to him at the window
mexican	if i wasn 't stuck , i would 've left a long time ago . don 't waste your time at this location .
mexican	with the amount of time i sat in the drive through they could 've made some from scratch .
mexican	drinks are good , but service is so slow .
mexican	every single time i go to this location i sit in the drive thru for the very least 30 minutes and most of the time it is just for 2 drinks not even food just drinks . not to mention the staff is extremely rude ! ! i will from now on make the drive to lone mountain and decatur where they are quick and decently friendly .
mexican	he then proceeds to touch his face and nose waiting to bag your food and then the cherry on top ... he licked his fingers to grab napkins to put in my bag . i have officially sworn off fast food after witnessing what i did today .
mexican	how slow ? i had enough time to create a yelp account and write this review . i have two cars in front of me , c 'mon del taco !
mexican	waited thirty minutes . this is the second time waiting ridiculously long at this location .
mexican	the workers didn 't even have the audacity to let us know they were closed .
mexican	ummm , what ? ? ? in retaliation , when i was given my large drink the lid was not on all the way so it spilled all over my car . every time i come here there is some problem , usually with the 2nd window not the 1st . drive the few extra miles and go to the taco bell on cave creek and bell .
mexican	don 't go inside . if you had free time . lol . i pass on this location .
mexican	the total was ~ $ 18 and i added $ 2 tip ( again , drive thru ) . i got home and discovered that i was given a shrimp burrito and a styrofoam container of plain chips . no nacho toppings . basically i paid $ 11 for a box of chips . learn from my mistake : check order before driving home . the burrito was fine , but not worth $ 20 - even with a side of plain unsalted chips - from a drive thru .
mexican	my last 2 visits in the drive thru after paying for the food i was advised to go park at the front door to get my food ( observed this same behavior with other vehicles as well ) . the first visit was a single item and the 2nd visit was a 2 items ( nothing special needed to be done ) . unless there is a trend i 'm not aware of isn 't it logical to wait for your non-special request food at the drive thru window ? ? if not bk corp needs to visit this location stat !
mexican	was rushed off the drive thru radio while ordering . there wasn 't even any other people there . then wen i got to the window , i didn 't get a " hi hello thank you you 're welcome bye " at all . i just got a rude stare , even got an eye roll when i took a second paying exact amount of coins .
mexican	just be prepared . even in n out is faster than that . also , prices are higher than what 's advertised on tv .
mexican	drive thru takes longer than forever , and jesus himself would bow down in the event of a miracle that the order comes up correctly and you don 't have to get back in the only line longer than time warner cable 's customer service phone line .
mexican	seriously ? done with this place . i don 't have time to wait for fast food .
mexican	they just they never smile . i even tried to joke to get a crack and i got nothing. horrible for being so new to neighborhood . their food is on point so their customer service needs to step it up or they are going to loose a lot of customers ! come on management ! ! !
mexican	it tasted like soap . didn 't have time to go back and get my money back . lady in the window was sweet though .
mexican	the guacamole was dark green like it had been sitting since morning and the green salsa was watery . i will try a different dish from here before deciding totally against it though . from this experience i would rate robertos 100x better .
mexican	they weren 't busy inside and there was only 2 cars in front of me and it still took them over 20 minutes for me to get my food . i got a bacon breakfast burrito and the bacon was super over cooked , like not crunchy bacon but like hard and dry so it sure if was pre made and sitting for a while or what . i wanted to give this place a chance since it 's close by but i will find another place .
mexican	inside , the cashier didn 't ask how could he help me ; just looked at me . the wait inside was horrible , and the lobby was not clean .
mexican	ordered 2 items then asked a question which was answered with silence for 2 minutes . kept saying " hello " with no answer . got to the window and to informed the girl / woman that we had more . her attitude was horrible , unapologetic and as though we inconvenienced her . the food was still wrong after multiple explanations and she charged us for food that we did not order or receive . never go to restaurants that hire people like this and make them customer facing . all it says is we don 't care . i will never go to any of your locations ever after this . we want $ 15 an hour . then try doing your job .
mexican	it 's 7 : 10am and the doors are locked ! not a good way to gain customers .
mexican	well that brought my wife into patron for lunch to find out what the big deal must be about . well , it 's not that great . here 's the lowdown : - chips and salsa : free and tasty . the best deal about this visit . - house margarita : a bit bitter and large . at least it was large . - chicken fajitas ( my wife ordered this ) - enchiladas suizas : watery green sauce , not much cheese , chicken was ok . four chicken enchiladas altogether and just mediocre . not that tasty . unfortunately , our first visit will be our last .
mexican	after reading the reviews , we were ready for some tasty mexican at taco tonto 's ... wrong ! i ordered a chicken burrito . lots of plain , unseasoned chicken but not much of anything else . my first time in memory that i could not finish a burrito . just no mexican taste . my wife 's tostada came with the cheese and meat on the tortilla but nothing else . we found out as we left that they had forgotten to put the lettuce , tomato , etc. on the top . our friend 's potato burrito was bland and not much more than a tortilla stuffed with potato . won 't be back .
mexican	ordered the large fish burrito and my pal had the large beef . both were big substantial and boring . seven lives beats this place hands down . i guess you can 't always rely on yelp to get it right every time .
mexican	well needless to say i ate and left . i don 't even remember what i ate , but it was food for sure -- i think ! ? okay gotta stop being mean . let 's just say it wasn 't anything " new . " nothing i couldn 't have ordered say from rubio 's or chipotle . yo quero taco bells please : ( the place itself was decorated with some traditional mexican portraits and paintings in an industrial-like setting . kinda odd , but whatever tickles your senses i guess . - enjoy !
mexican	we had to wait 20-30 minutes . the hostess was a pinch rude when i asked where to stand while we waited ( everywhere you stand in that place you 're in the way ! ) . i got an a la carte veggie taco which was decent , just oily ( enough to make me sick ) . i think i 'm throwing the towel in on you , cabo . i 'll take the 3 miles drive to plaza to go somewhere worth my money .
mexican	the location definitely has a different feel than the previous building and the other locations . i actually like it more now , more modern ! my experience was just okay ! i ordered a fajita bowl with chicken and was surprised to learn that onions / peppers aren 't automatically included . service was actually pretty fast which was nice . overall , nothing about the flavors in the food or service stood out to really gain my interest to return .
mexican	dropped to a one star review for shitty business practices and hiring shady bastards at the register .
mexican	i specifically asked for all my order to have no onions ( allergic ) . came home , found onions on my fries . i couldn 't drive 15 minutes back for them to fix their mistake . they just rush through my order without making sure it 's correct . poor customer service .
mexican	i show up and the guy was very hesitant and said " uhh ... we close at 10 today . " it was evident in his voice he was lying when i mentioned yelp said they were open til 11 . won 't come here again .
mexican	super rude and unprofessional . stick to your hours or change them .
mexican	thankfully jaime was an awesome server and made me forget ! ! !
mexican	was very disappointed in the food . chips and salsa were not great and the food was just edible . ordered everything from burritos to fajitas to the steak salad . the steak was hard and overcooked and the food was over salted . on the border makes better food than this place . never again . the chicken also is like a rotisserie chicken . gross .
mexican	i 'll call in the morning to request a refund but in the meantime never again will i visit at this location .
mexican	completely disgusting ! ! ! i mean come on man you 're outside .... we can see you ! ! ! ! !
mexican	come on people get with times , . the only reason we saw the sign was because no one greeted us or looked at us . boooo
mexican	best i can compare it to would be a poor imitation of a filaberto 's . neither of us finished our food & not because we were served huge portions . i won 't be back but i guess i 'm in the minority here .
mexican	place is closed for business . signs are all gone , outside furniture gone .
mexican	very loud with the music they play inside . ordered ranchos huevos . watched them make my order and got it as soon as it was done . i took my first bite and thought that the it was pretty good . second bite and thereafter not so good . the eggs had such a hard brown crust on the bottom that it ruined the rest of the meal . not good and i cant see ever going back .
mexican	i 'm severely disappointed ( not about price i 'm ok with paying money for good food ) for about $ 9 you get a taco aside i took the empanada some chips and some salsa . the taco had very little cotija cheese ... some will flavored chicken and less than a tablespoon of guacamole . the line took about ten minutes .. not a big deal . but the food was cold , my taco literally looked like someone had eaten half the chicken out of it i 'm really disappointed for almost $ 10 for a lunch meal i really expected better .
mexican	all you sell is chicken ! ! ! ! lame and never again .
mexican	azs culinary status just fell down a couple notches today . all of those workers who can 't earn a livable wage just became even more unlivable .
mexican	sadly , my da surf rider plate was pretty disappointing .
mexican	i 'm wondering if the people that cut her check know it 's being closed 1.5 hours early . honestly there is no excuse for that .
mexican	got to the office and they got the order wrong . called to let them know and my secretary drove back over . they acted like she was inconveniencing them , no " we 're sorry , " let alone even an offer of a free bag of chips or a drink . disappointed . shows poor management , training , lack of true customer service .
mexican	i love that this location has a drive thru , but the food fell short for me . it was also a bit expensive for what was ordered . i honestly could 've gone to taco bell and received a better meal for half the price . i just wanted a simple bean burrito and it was horrible . the beans were incredibly bland and also burnt in places . yuck . i did give an extra star because of the convenience of the drive thru and because my daughter enjoyed her quesadilla . not much of a chance that i 'll return but maybe others will have better luck ...
mexican	however i got there at 11 : 30 exactly , except the employees like to close 30 minutes early , so don 't expect their hours to match what they have advertised at this location .
mexican	lady told me to hold on a second then proceeded to talk on the phone with her friend about plans later all while her mic was still on . when i kept asking if she was done and ready to take my order she kept saying " hold on its important " no it wasn 't . get off the phone when you are working and do your job .
mexican	drove up to the drive thru bought pollo la brasa everything was fresh but when i came to the window i asked for hot sauce and condiment and they said it doesn 't include in the meal they said if i wanted hot sauce it would be an extra charge .
mexican	there is nothing memorable or special about this place .
mexican	dry carne asada and stale chips ... no bueno with la bonita meat market in the same shopping center you would belive this restaurant would at least try to keep up ... i rather go there for lunch ... sorry vatos just being honest ...
mexican	i went with a few friends who loved their meals , but i wasn 't entirely thrilled with mine . i had a steak quesadilla which was incredibly bland . the soft shell as somewhat pita-like and warm , which was nice , but when everything is so dry--it lacks in taste . the only reason this place gets a second star is because the service was good ; our waitress generally cared and helped me out because i have a food allergy to onions . very , very sweet waitress ! i 'd come back for the service and maybe to try it again , but for now , i 'm not entirely keen on it .
mexican	i had high hopes because it seemed legit . keep looking if you wsnt really good tamales .
mexican	like shoe leather and expensive . skip it entirely and go to chipotle across the freeway . waste of money .
mexican	i do not understand why they are so popular all over the valley . maybe it 's good for drunks whose stomachs are so polluted with skunky beer and whose palate has been ruined by smoking cheapass ditchweed , but the food at filiberto 's looks like someone already ate it and they put it on a paper plate . i tried it twice to be fair and i feel lucky to be alive .
mexican	i can 't even call to cuss this place out ! the phone is busy always . your order will always be wrong . always . i don 't know how many times i have asked for a " bean and cheese burrito with no sauce " and ended up will a sauce explosion . nachos with no cheese , ask for a side of secret sauce ... get sour cream . flour tortillas should be soft , not crunchy . also , why are you hoarding the cheese ? put some on the tacos . will drive the extra miles to not give them my business . done .
mexican	i spent half an hour at 1804 e southern ave looking for taco del mar and could not find it. supposedly it is in the same complex as the yoga studio and nutrition center , both of which i did find . i was totally jonesing for a taco but alas , left the basha 's strip mall quite unfulfilled . perhaps taco del mar is one of those ' members only ' places , or an old timey speakeasy but with tacos . or was there simply an invisibility cloak thrown over it yesterday ? i don 't know , but i am still craving a good taco .
mexican	this is literally the slowest fast food restaurant in the city ! ! ! 17 minutes in the drive-thru is ridiculous ! never again
mexican	what 's up everytime drive thru ? ? it 's like get an order and put the order through . multi million dollar biz with automated operations just follow it . let 's get going and speed it up fellow coffee survivors .
mexican	based on my last few experiences at this location ------------- the high standards that i enjoyed when i first ate here are not there anymore -------- pizza was dry , salty and dull ! ! since my last visit i checked current inspection results - see for yourself as i did ! a city / state health inspection is not " hearsay " - unfortunately , this location was awarded a " d " and had several violations - this is fact and a matter of county record . hopefully they act on this inspection and find a way to bring there standards back up to the high level they once were . until then , i will be taking my business elsewhere !
mexican	recognize that cutting people short with toppings might save you money in the short term but lose someone 's business going forward . will not return .
mexican	really need to fix service to get more customers .
mexican	turd . litterbox . brass poles . whore house . steroids . date rape . this place sucks weiners for sandwiches . ( the kind crackheads buy at 711 for a buck fiddy ..... ) the end
mexican	i get off of work at 11 and they 're the closest location to my house and every time i check they 're time it says midnight but when i get there they 're closed ...
mexican	i ordered the street tacos the first time and the chicken tings tapas the second . each time there was not much flavor . i do not recommend eating here . however , the employees are very friendly and kind , i just wish that they worked some place else : ( .
mexican	service from the inside is good though . avoid the drive thru unless you want to pay for something you 're not getting .
mexican	the restaurant itself is very clean and well kept , which makes dining both inside or on the patio an option . the food has been lacking flavor , especially the chicken and steak . very over cooked each time i have visited here , along with the brown rice . the other condiments appear to be fresh . i highly suggest avoiding the meat due to overlooked .
mexican	this is over a two month span of three visits . i 'm not sure how this location even stays in business .
mexican	now , i will say the tacos were pretty good . we tried a few variations between the two of us . perhaps this isn 't fair , being from south florida but how dare these people call that shameful drink a margarita . it was awful and for eight dollars ( the house ) , it should have been spectacular . of course we didn 't learn our lesson . my husband ordered a fourteen dollar margarita , in a vain attempt at putting the last one behind us . if you like battery acid and mediocre food , go there .
mexican	the fish taco was a frozen fishstick , i kid you not . they stuck a fishstick in a tortilla . there was hair on the burritos . yuck yuck yuck .
mexican	last night i went though the drive thru because i wanted to try the new whopper , after waiting 20 min . i finally get my order and bring it home only to find out it wasn 't my order .. tonight i go there because i really want to try the new whopper and again after waiting 20 + min . they forgot half my order . i won 't be back . and if the owner does end up reading this review then he should seriously consider finding new management !
mexican	it amazes my that anyone would choose to eat at this chain . i bet the rations they serve from the back of un trucks to refugees is better .
mexican	i made an online order , i was on time but my food was not . when i was told " we didn 't get to it yet " i watched my half made order get skipped over four times to make others food in line as i stood waiting . not a happy customer .
mexican	the average wait time is at least 20 minutes .... there 's usually only like two people working the line and then a bunch of people in the back doing god knows what ? so the line creeps very very slowly to say the least . plus almost every time i get a burrito from here , it just falls apart . how can you not know how to roll a burrito considering that is one of your main duties ? ! the owner of this particular location should be ashamed. hire some more competent employees
mexican	so bad , in fact , that i 'm writing this review as they sit in front of me . the verde sauce is watery and tastes sour , the enchiladas themselves almost seem like they were frozen and microwaved ( which would explain why they arrived at my table 2 minutes after i ordered them and there wasn 't a soul in the kitchen ) , and the tortilla chips are cold and stale . i wouldn 't recommend this place to anyone looking for a decent mexican meal .
mexican	the dining room is old , well used , and out dated . margarita was lacking in every way . spend the remaining of the night throwing up ! ! ! do not eat here !
mexican	parking is a joke . the layout of the drive thru is worse . staff is rude . drinks taste different than other locations . there are other locations more deserving of your hard earned dollars .
mexican	for this to have been my 1st mexican restaurant to try in phx , i was highly disappointed . i wasn 't a high fan of the house salsa . i ordered the steak quesadillas and i wish i hadn 't . they were extremely greasy and didn 't have any flavor . i ordered a house margarita as well , more like a house lemonade .
mexican	menu limited mexican options . asked for the house specialty . uninspired taste and food was served lukewarm . dirty glass and prices are medium high for mexican lunch food . alot of good competition in the category and probably won 't repeat .
mexican	enjoyed sitting outside with view of uptown and grazing tapas style . wife loved drink special , which was a ginger infused vodka concoction whose name escapes me . food was not particularly memorable . cost $ 70 , $ 65 minus cocktail for four . those tapas add up ! good service and food came out promptly . better for drinks and light eating than dinner .
mexican	plenty of other real israeli kosher restaurants in vegas to go too !
mexican	however , mesa grill has removed the blue corn tamale replacing it with a garlic tamale . please , please , please consider going back to the blue corn . the garlic tamale was dry and tasteless . also the portion for the salad seems to have decreased , but the price doesn 't reflect this . with all the stellar eating options in las vegas , i think it 's time we moved on from mesa grill .
mexican	had dinner here with my girlfriend . we thought the food was good but unfortunately , when we got home , both of us had stomachaches and got pretty sick . we ordered the baja and shrimp tacos , kale salad , and mexi wings . i presume that it was the mexi wings that made us feel so ill because the chicken might have been a bit uncooked . not sure what else would 've made us sick other than that . the food was tasty , service was mediocre and after tonight 's pain , we definitely will not be going back .
mexican	nothing special but seriously a little less refried beans please for the taco salad
mexican	i felt like i was eating the cheapest of ingredients here . yuck .
mexican	don 't order postmates or to-go . they perpetually mess up the order . ordered the texas trio tonight to go- got the queso and salsa , no guacamole . this is the second time this has happened . guess it 's my fault for ordering it again . the guacamole is the most expensive part of the trio so forgetting it twice feels intentional . ordered an extra side of sour cream , and when i put it on my food .... it was whipped cream . the food is great , and it 's a good experience in person , but my postmates orders have been consistently screwed up . such a bummer .
mexican	got meal before chips and salsa. took for ever to get check and it was really slow at the time . go eat somewhere else ! not worth the money
mexican	horribly slow service and food isn 't worth waiting for ! oh yeah , and there 's hardly any seating either .
mexican	better than taco bell but not better than other boutique burrito places . i thought burrito house was better .
mexican	the food really doesn 't have much flavor . our party shared a cheese crisp . i had the chile relleno burrito with rice and beans . nothing was great . the tortillas tasted like store bought . the burrito was simply strips of pablano chile and some melted cheese rolled into a tortilla . on a positive note , our server was friendly and made no mistakes with our order .
mexican	neither return trip repeated the first experience . i feel let down after getting excited about a decent place close to my office . poor service and bland food are the norm here . good food for the price . i 'm from okc ( with a lot of good mexican and tex-mex food ) and this place would stand up in the fierce competition of that market . i 'm definitely going back . my only complaint is the chips and salsa . salsa was bland except for lots of salt . chips were kind of mediocre as well . but these are minor compared to the great food i had .
mexican	the following review is from when it was taco tio . don tortaco is much better than taco tio. carne asada burrito had rice in it and had no guacamole. fail. guacamole always goes with carne asada. always . rice never goes in a burrito. never. tortilla was pretty good ; didn 't taste rubbery and was a little flakey . quesadilla was dry . i want my quesadilla smothered in butter . cheese tastes like rubber .
mexican	eduardo was my cashier at the whopper bar at the rio hotel and casino .. he has horrible customer service i littlerly had to return my whoppers since he only put cheese on them and worst of all he likes to argue saying he is right worst experices ever rather go to any other bk and get better service .. was defenely not expecting this from a place that receives so many tourist two dumbs down .. not going back
mexican	bad service . asked to have food to eat here and they packed it to go . annoying ! they forgot about us and served others there order before us even though we were ahead . i had to finally stand in front of them to get my order . now for the food . like i said , eeeewwww ! shrimp was over cooked because they forgot it . chili rellano was horrible and the chili was so tough and stringy that is made it totaly enedible . my dog liked the chicken out of the disgusting enchilada though .
mexican	it started with a cranky waiter who told me that if i wanted to know the specials , then i should have read them on the board . the food was downhill from there . the entire place smelled like fried onions .
mexican	b. tostada de aguachiles was not the business they don 't devein the shrimp & the tacos were just ok .
mexican	i love filibertos but this one just kinda made me upset .
mexican	i don 't have much more to say . everything is bland and staff is slow . try the berry margarita .... out of this world .
mexican	tacos lacked flavor . the fish taco was over-battered . if you are mentioning california , you must master a fish taco or not have it on the menu . pastor was very dry . guacamole was sub par , again ... a ca staple . hope this gets better ... i was so hoping for a taste of home . ambience is great ; may be a fabulous spot for drinks . i 'd head to comida , babalu , or sabor instead . i hope it gets better ! ! !
mexican	nothing fancy . had the fajitas ( streak / chicken ) were good but ... didn 't even get a choice of flour or corn or refried beans or black beans before the server walked away . seemed to be her thing walking away as your talking . didn 't get a welcoming feeling from her or the hostess upon arrival . the steak a little dry , good chicken . service was kinda pricy for what you get unless you come for taco tuesday . so overall meh food and not a great attitude for customer service think it wasn 't our place
mexican	everyone talks about the tacos , so naturally i got a burrito . it was pretty standard in every conceivable way : taste , size , etc . the complimentary salsas bumped things up a notch .
mexican	the food is nothing to go out of your way for . they would do better during lunch hours if they ran better lunch specials as their are a lot of business people in the area looking for a decent place to sit down for lunch . tried a few different things on the menus and nothing has ever left me craving for it again . i have gone there on friday and saturday night for music and drinks and this tends to be the best time to enjoy what sandbar is about .
mexican	the chicken was good but the beef not so much . the salad tasted like dirt unfortunately and the rice was not good either . i recommend getting some condiments to help the overpriced under portion plates go down smoother . very nice people and friendly service . not sure if ill be back .
mexican	first im a vegetarian , and when i said that at the counter . they looked at me like i had 2 heads . no suggestions , not " we have this , or we can do this .... " just ........ a .......... blank ............ stare ............ ok , i 'll have 2 of the triple something ....... beans and red and green sauce . it was like a water balloon . one wrong bite and this thing was going to explode . the combination did not mix well . i threw the free one away ....... no bien . this place is utterly forgettable .
mexican	definitely skip the ceviche bar-- neither fresh nor lots of fish . wouldn 't go back .
mexican	i 'm a hispanic californian and this food was not it at all . the guacamole was beyond gross . i don 't know who can mess up guacamole . the enchiladas were edible but not necessarily good . we won 't return here . lesson learned .
mexican	it 's like a place my white bread grandparents would go to on a wednesday for lunch . nothing tastes bad ... but nothing tastes good either .
mexican	i got a fish burrito and it was over cooked and mushy . i live down the street about 2 minutes but think it 's worth the extra drive to go to amados down the road .
mexican	the rice was undercooked , chicken was flavorless , and the beans looked like bat skat . the chimi was average and a tad spicy . their bat brew was alright ... a bit sour . my friend had a random ass vegetable in his burrito ( broccoli ) . maybe they thought the bat brew would help us forget but nah boo . leaving the restaurant felt like exiting a disneyland ride . maybe if they put forth more effort towards the food than the atmosphere then maybe i 'll try it again .
mexican	pretty bland for mexican food . not impressed . service and ambience were good , however .
mexican	who is kerry anyway ? because i can watch the cooks make my food and there isn 't anyone named kerry i assure u . juan , carlos , manuel , felipe , etc etc ... but no kerry , take my word for it . not really sure what justifies a $ 20 burger with no fries , a drunken stupor ? yep , that 's the reason !
mexican	i don 't usually post bad reviews , but in this case i 'm pissed . no strawberry lemonade or mint limeade . the horchata & southwest limeade machine isn 't even turned on , so everything is room temp . the bathroom was embarrassing . i haven 't even eaten my food yet , i 'm actually nervous . had they at least been friendly i could give a 2nd star , but no such luck .
mexican	at 2 am they have 1 cashier only 1 . while most others have 2 or 3 and arent afraid to call more . and the employees arent that bad . but the clientele who frequent this one are lacking in the way they dress and how they act . plus the manager at the mc donalds acts like your not there . hence the del taco in the parking lot with better food anyway .
mexican	only reason i tried it was from a friends reccomendation and he must have been hung over that day that he thought it was so great ?
mexican	i got tamales because i am a sucker for homemade tamales , they were the worst tamales i have ever had . they were super dry , no flavor , very little meat . just plain gross . i will stick to making my own . it was just ok , we would maybe go back for tacos but it was nothing amazing . i think i 'm missing the hype .
mexican	.. only gave it a 2 because the poblano soup was amazing .
mexican	i had read their menu on line ( so that i wouldn 't have to figure out what i wanted while standing in line ) but was told the menu is wrong and they don 't have those items any longer . that should have been the first clue . horrible ! portions were ridiculously small but since the taste was pretty nonexistent i didn 't miss much . absurd amount of money for worse than mediocre food !
mexican	the food is not spicy whatsoever , even when i requested that my meal be made extra spicy . my spouse ordered " fried " ice cream and was served ice cream that was rolled in corn flakes . really ? not authentic at all .
mexican	i 've tried a breakfast burrito , red chile and green chile burrito , more scalding as in temperature than anything . i 've had better . they only accept cash .
mexican	the employees kept talking amongst themselves and barely paid any attention to me or any other customer . i 'm staying with chipotle
mexican	its so annoying . the old people in the bingo room are rude ! just becareful when you go there .
mexican	service was kinda slow . the salsa that comes with the chips is hot ! food was mediocre . we wouldn 't come back ... only came here bc ikea is across the street . we 've been waiting for our server to take our check now for a good 21 minutes ! ! ! it also didn 't help that i got bit / stung by something while sitting outside on the patio that caused my foot to itch and burn something awful ! ! note to management : you may want to spray out on patio if you don 't already ...
mexican	i came here to have a margarita and somehow , i didn 't have one . i had coffee instead which wasn 't as strong as i wanted . anyway , the steak kind of sucked , it lacked flavor and was more well done than medium . the shrimp avocado salad was gross . there was a sauce on the dish that gave everything a bad taste . it was all over the avocado also so i couldn 't even have that . on the other hand the quesadilla appetizer and guacamole ( chunky ) was excellent .
mexican	the sopes were ok , the salsa was pretty good as well , but the tacos coapa were flavorless . we didn 't stay for dessert due to the crappy seating , the bad lighting , and the inept , slow service . not recommended .
mexican	if you like gummy , soggy flour tortillas that can 't be picked up , then you would love it here . i was totally enchanted by the hot coals and cooking meat , but it should have been seasoned before hitting the fire and the add ons could be more exciting . the tortillas were a disaster though . since there are no seats , i ended up sitting in the car picking the meat , etc with my fingers and leaving the gum wads behind . sorry . they could step up the game a bit .
mexican	i know it 's only fast food , but how many idiots are working in the kitchen ? i wish there was a closer one so i could go there in the hopes that they 'd get our order correct !
mexican	i 've been 3 or 4 times now , which i feel is enough times to make a fairly informed review . it 's also enough times to know that i don 't really need to go back . there was nothing exactly wrong with it , but there 's certainly nothing right enough to make me jump for joy at the prospect of eating there . the food could generously be described as bland and generic and lacking in almost every element of flavor that i would have expected . there are plenty of other restaurants that do a much better job with tacos / burritos / etc , and that 's where i 'll be taking my business .
mexican	it was just okay . the margaritas were not freshly made - they tasted like box margaritas from the grocery store . i was expecting so much more for $ 13 a drink . not worth it at all . staff was nice - the waiter took a long time to come back after we asked to check out . nachos were decent at best . bigger does not mean better . don 't think we will be back .
mexican	the place is really nice looking but the food isn 't that good . way overpriced , even for downtown . the street taco tortilla is tiny . the ingredients don 't seem to flow together and not tasty . tried the baja fish and al pastor .... i 'll try it again when they 're open for awhile and see if the food and flow at the place come together . customer service was good but you can tell they 're still trying to figure things out .
mexican	it was mostly rice , could barely taste the hot sauce , didn 't taste that fresh , not very much chicken and what was there was pretty dry . also thought it was a little lame that they were charging extra for sautéed veggies . i know that 's standard for guac at most places but veggies too ? not horrible but not good , would sooner go to chipotle . 2.5 / 5
mexican	just eh . the papusas are decent . the chips and salsa have to have been store bought .... and who the hell puts a " cell phone store " inside of a restaurant ? hello , ghetto !
mexican	eh .. just eh .. they changed their menu so now they barley have anything ive become to love over tome at taco mexico .. too bad
mexican	i wasn 't wowed by the food , and my horchata was very watery and too sweet ( and served in a leaking broken cup ) . in addition , there was a long wait to be seated , and once we were , service was a bit spotty .
mexican	my burrito was cold and el pastor was way under seasoned . such a bummer for such pricey food .
mexican	it is just american-ized mexican food and there is something in their cooking ( spice / oils ) that tends to not agree with me later so we have stopped going .
mexican	nothing special here . the meat was cold , the default tacos were soft ( i expected hard .. and didn 't realize until afterwards that i had to ask for hard , since the taco picture showed hard tacos ) , and you have to ask for napkins . the guacamole tasted like it came from a jar . it was fine for a quick mexican meal ... but nothing i 'd go out of my way for !
american	while the cheap burgers and enormous , multi-ingredient sandwiches named after various neighborhood cops are tempting , my order is always the same : a chili dog ( ok , usually two ) and a can of coke . designer dogs they 're not , but the wieners at steve 's have that essential snap , and the chili is flavorful if not spicy .
american	they are a rescue shelter for farm animals , and as such , have a wide assortment of not only farm animals ( horses , cows , mules , donkeys , ducks , chickens , and turkeys , but also rabbits , turtles , peacocks , and dogs and cats ) . they sell their own eggs and honey , have squash , potatoes , and for this time of the year , pumpkins . ( pumpkins don 't arrive until the second weekend of october , however ) . there is also a maze for the kids as well .
american	with all of the kids and parties going on , the place is always clean and the food comes out pretty fast . it is not the greatest pizza , but the kids love it and they love you even more for taking them to ppp !
american	i 've been here many times and every single time i leave like i did the time prior , satisfied . great tasting food , service is excellent , and the park is beautiful .
american	i really enjoyed watching the chef create the desserts right in front of us at the bar . we ordered the soleil , which was the dessert shaped like an orange , and the mt . exotic desert , which was like a mango flavored mousse cake . i personally liked the soleil better-- it was so refreshing and delicious ! i may come back just for this .
american	a great place to try the food. food presentations are creative. portions are huge , good for two. huge sekection of food choices. has outdoor seating and a bar area too .
american	the food was awesome ... true southern style ! prepared directly in front of you while you wait . i was surprised to hear how long this place has been around , as i 've lived in charlotte nearly two years before finding out about it . i tell everyone i know about it , make sure to check this spot out ... soon !
american	the portions are huge so come hungry and ready to eat . the ladies that served us were super nice and we also bought their anniversary mugs ! : ) hopefully when i am back to vegas i can come back to this spot .
american	great apps too . a must visit ... you won 't be disappointed !
american	it 's a good choice after a long day on the water . i recommend the pizza , burgers and mac & cheese bites !
american	even though it 's a sports bar , it was not crazy-loud so we could talk in normal voices and not have to yell . the staff seated us right away , and even cleaned up a booth for us which comes with a small tv so we watched the red sox game and / or college softball while we ate . the service was great , our waitress checked on us often and was very warm and welcoming . the menu has a good variety of foods and drinks to choose from . the nachos were yummy , especially the salsa , which tasted homemade . the turkey burger with chipotle mayo was also very tasty .
american	my favorite was the banana and macadamia pancakes . great service too !
american	service is spot on and friendly . you can sit back and enjoy an evening of good food and great drinks ! i love how so many of our uptown and downtown buildings are being saved and created into great destinations for food and fun . corduroy is one of them . built in 1928 as a grocery store . yep , and you can still get food & drink here . . . just wonderfully updated !
american	a dish i would avoid : cioppino . this is a kind of bouillabaisse . could not find all the ingredients mentioned in the menu . too much of the potato filler [ about one third of the dish ] . $ 30 - way too high for that .
american	a nice menu selection of burgers salads and sandwiches . a healthy veggie burger was fantastic the kobe burger is such a great burger . the zucchini fries are so good . the ice tea was passion fruit which has such a nice taste . the service from rachel was so amazing it made the meal even better . the pricing is extremely reasonable for a las vegas hotel . bring your friends they will not be disappointed .
american	first , the service . it 's not " bad " per se but it 's really random . sometimes terrific and sometimes slow / disorganized . second , the wait for food . maybe this is related to the service but i have had a couple of really long waits here . now the positives ; excellent quality food , a varied menu , beautiful interior and wonderful bar . some recommendations ; the sliders , the ribs and my god the fish fry ! best bluegill i have had , period .
american	definitely a cool , but un-pretentious vibe they deliver in the food & drink department . all of the mention of the rotisserie chicken & corn bread is right on the money. everything i have tried has been savory & delicious. on of my favorites in scottsdale !
american	" just a good local place to go where you always feel welcome . special kudos to starr and charlie but the rest of the staff is the best too ! try it .
american	the staff is friendly and welcoming . coffee and water refills come frequently .
american	a great pre-fix lunch the zucchini soup was wonderful and the salmon was perfect
american	if you don 't want to stand in a long line and don 't want to pay a ton of money for breakfast , stop by this yummy place . i only tried the cinnamon bun and nutella varieties , but they were both delicious .
american	get there early as they can be a little busy and in the summer , you won 't want to sit outside as it 's too warm and that is where the majority of the seating is located . i would recommend the chiliquiles with an egg . pancakes are good too !
american	the drinks are delicious- i had an old fashion , really enjoyed it .
american	having just moved from chicago a year ago , i tend to rate the quality of a place based on the quality of their italian beef sandwich . this place is no portillo 's or luke 's ( in terms of beef sandwiches ) , but it is still quite tasty . i recommend a side of hot peppers and a side of beef juice for dipping . good size clean place with chicago memorabilia on the walls , and very nice staff . overall , their rock solid menu and full bar make this place a solid 4 .
american	i came here on mother 's day and i will be coming back pros : - the food was delicious ! i had the swordfish for $ 28 and i would absolutely recommend it . - the restaurant is very visually appealing on the inside . the lighting sets a classy vibe . - waitress was nice and came to our table regularly even though the restaurant was extremely busy . cons : - we were given glasses with no water . when i asked for water they gave me a cup of water with a straw in it . i noticed other people had their tables regularly refilled with water , but not us . - the wait for food was around 45 minutes
american	the service could be improved . overall , a very good restaurant and i would recommend it for a great breakfast cafe .
american	the place is small , like 1800 sq feet hey we need your menu small . we went for dinner during a friends bachelor party . big thanks to all the yelp reviewers who steered me right . bacon jam and the oxtail risotto were great . the main thing to know about this place is the food is family style . the concept is you order the sides like oxtail risotto , mac n cheese , or the sprouts and suds hash and share with the table . then you order your protein individually , but you could really share that too . good food , i definitely enjoyed the experience and will go back !
american	the beer is eclectic and fun to explore , the wine list , according to my friends , is outstanding . the food and service are superb . todd creates masterpieces , from appetizers to main courses through desserts . it is hard to describe ... you should just experience todd ' unique dining , a hidden gem .
american	we 've lived all over the us and have been to many outstanding restaurants , this is one of them . the food was excellent , the atmosphere very cozy , and the service excellent . i took my wife there for her birthday and it was romantic . and , unlike many restaurants in la , new york , paris where the tables are inches from each other , we had a very private table and could talk freely . also reasonable price for the quality . highly recommended .
american	family run and with a great old country feel , the food is solid . i has the stuffed cabbage appetizer and the lesco stew with sausage . i can 't wait to return .
american	located off the main strip of avon , but don 't let the location be the deterring factor . whether you want a drink and appetizer or a full course meal . it will please all palates .
american	a great restaurant to me is defined by all components of the meal from service and front of house to the last lick of the spoon .. this place exceeded our expectations .. i 've been to all of the usually spots but if you want classy superb service and quality look no further .. so much vegas history was made in this building .. the food well i 'll let the pics do the talking
american	good pizza , excellent salads , and good hoagies . a place where locals go . service is always good and the food comes quickly .
american	much better than subway . they have hot and cold subs . i love their chicken parm sub and the italian . they have a giant size for all you hungry folks too . the employees there are also really nice and freindly . great place !
american	) shop in kent with fresh quality meat and ingredients in generous quantities , good variety of specials , and superb homemade soups that are rotated daily . ( side note : shout out to manhattan mushroom , my all-time favorite ! ) i believe they offer delivery service now if you 're into that sort of thing and they do a pretty good job of keeping their sandwich specials and soups of the day updated on their website .
american	i loved moca , but this place is fantastic . i came here for quick lunch and it didn 't disappoint . an amazing sandwich , voodoo chips ( soo good ) and soda for very reasonable prices . i 'm looking forward to summer when i will be in the area more for lunch . a place like this in your neighborhood .... you can 't help but want to be a regular .
american	we tried their two most popular items , the original 1762 and the earl 's club ( the person at the register said these were the most popular - i didn 't do research to verify ) . the club was good , but it was a tad salty for me . i did , however , loved the original . the combination of roast beef , cheddar & horseradish sauce was just amazing . if you order a medium drink with your sandwich , you get a bag of chips too !
american	when staying at the hotel i will eat here multiple times on the trip . can 't go wrong with their triple decker ruben !
american	the " pig kahuna " is great , but the malibu is by far my favorite . i always want to try a new sandwich but every time i go i can 't imagine anything being as good as the malibu ! the staff is always nice and you can 't beat sitting on the patio to eat when the weather is nice .
american	this is the perfect place to make a killer picnic basket .
american	indoor / outdoor seating ... the patio is enclosed and well-misted in the summer . the food is good and reasonably priced . the handlebar centrally located in the mill ave district .
american	i especially liked the sushi , king crab legs , and mediterranean section . the dessert table looked delicious . they even have cotton candy ! great service !
american	weak beer selection . snacked , but the food served looked and smelled delicious .
american	i started with a flight of 5 . great beer other than the coffee vanilla , and i think that was just because the taste did set with me . everyone else seemed to like it because it was being ordered like crazy . the brewery is beautiful and spotless . this place was a frat start to my afternoon of brewery hopping !
american	unique food in a small town setting . make sure you have a reservation- the bread alone is worth the trip !
american	the wait staff was attentive and always on-point . for a couple of dcists searching for southern comfort food reminders of our upbringing , this was an excellent choice .
american	great staff and quick service . there takeout baskets are the really charming part about this place ! try the fried chicken with the 3 sides. hush puppies , sweet potato and a biscuit . the foods definite great and they also deliver around the area i was told ! check this place out . you won 't be disappointed
american	for a " fish camp , " i think it 's the best in the area .
american	festively decorated for the holiday . loved their unique cocktail options . had the beesies bread - unique and not too sweet . also the grapefruit mule which was very refreshing . bar service was good . space was cozy , though acoustics were a little loud . we had the cheese plate and the charcuterie- both were tasty . the deviled eggs were good too ( though not as good as the asbury from last nights dinner ! )
american	the seating is a bit tight , and a bit rustic - very new york bistro style . it gets a little loud at times , but nothing crazy . service in generally pretty good even when the place is jammed . the food is great - very well prepared and often unique as well ( think rack of caribou with jerusalem artichoke mash ) . a go-to spot for cocktails and some good food .
american	the variety of pancakes will give everyone something they 'd like and they are delicious and fluffy . i got a scrambler which was full of delicious and fresh tasting ingredients and my husband got the irish eggs benedict and cleaned his plate . we also split a cappuccino and their coffee was delicious as well . service is fast and food is good ! my only thought for improvement was i wish the peppers and onions in my scrambler had been cooked a little bit longer so that they were softer .
american	hot bread and whipped butter served on arrival . yum . my companion had the caesar salad with blackened salmon and said it was delicious . the salmon was a generous portion . i had the house salad with chicken . great chopped salad and the ( real ) chicken breast was cooked perfectly then sliced so it was very moist . iced tea was refreshing , service was attentive , noise level was reasonable .
american	the room is beautiful and our waitress was amazing . they have a good price on a lovely two course lunch prix fixe . i had brussels with lardon and goat cheese to start - a gorgeous grilled veal as my main - the side of kale was one of the loveliest kale i 've ever eaten . for dessert we were expertly steered to the pain perdu which has ruined me for any other french toast ever - get it ! ! !
american	the bar and dining room are beautiful , the cocktails were expertly mixed and the food was very good . i was a bit disappointed with the signature lemon pasta , which tasted like it was prepared in large batches and was sitting in the kitchen waiting to be taken out to diners for way too long . but other than that and no giada sighting , it was a thoroughly enjoyable meal .
american	service is impeccable ! they do their best to bring out your lunch in a timely fashion . i am partial to the pick-two . salad and flatbread . the blackfinn salad is amazing ! a simple yet delicious salad . it has parmesan cheese , pine nuts and onions ! amazing . very well managed too !
american	i had the steak and it was perfectly cooked and well seasoned . prices are on the expensive side , but this is to be expected from an upmarket bar / restaurant like museum tavern . my friend had the tuna burger which was really good , but came too raw for our liking . they took it back without complaint , and it was more our fault for not ordering it more well done to start with . the drinks from the bar look amazing and i will be sure to try an old fashioned the next time i go , based on the other reviews .
american	so many beers to choose from and you can make your own sampler .
american	eggs were cooked perfectly and the hash browns are not to be missed ! ( and add the onions ! ) the chicken and waffle was the best i have ever tasted . ( took a bite of my son 's ) everything made from scratch . we will definitely be back !
american	the fried chicken and waffles are to die for ! the chicken was flavorful , savory , fried to a perfect crisp . no words can tell you how good that fried chicken was but with the red velvet waffles it was perfection ! a little pricey but so worth it .
american	food was delicious . i highly recommend the french toast combo . service was also very good , but there seemed to be a disconnect between front of house and back of house . they miss 3 different elements of my order even though they were included on the bill . all in all , i would definitely go back and will check my order and the bill .
american	i wanted to try something unique so i got the curry eggs and it was a great choice . my friend got the tofu scramble , which was also delicious . i also thought that the serving sizes were plentiful . my only complaint would be that i wish the brunch menu included selections from the dinner menu . i definitely want to come back during dinner hours to try their pastas and burgers . eden definitely knows how to make healthy food taste good and is a great option if you want to eat clean .
american	seared is my favorite version . their tuna belly with foie gras was the best ! extra fatty and delicious on top of a rock salt that me and my friends thought was part of the fish lol the poutine foie gras is a must have there !
american	the patio is beautiful and inviting and a fun afternoon spot to meet up with friends and catch up ! super friendly staff as well !
american	i had a blended kona mocha javaccino , very refreshing on a hot sunny fall day . the grilled ham and cheese on gluten free bread was flavorful , with a side of chips and a pickle . my husband had the chicken salad sandwich on cranberry bread and a lemonade . overall , we 're very happy with the quality of the food , the friendly staff and the menu selections . they also serve breakfast , which my husband had - a bowl with hash browns , eggs and sausage with a side of fresh fruit .
american	classic mac is some of the best mac and cheese you 'll find !
american	we had great service and the food was delicious .
american	i love the atmosphere . service has been great the three times i went . loved the mac and cheese . had the fried green tomato sandwich every time because ... i might be addicted . i tried a few cocktails as well and each was great . great for date night , friend dinners , or dining alone at the bar . i want to go back on a weekend to enjoy the upstairs patio when it 's open .
american	i tried the tuna melt , hawaiian bbq , and tomato soup ! they were all delicious .
american	i had an interpretation of a chicago dog . the dog itself was outstanding . they make their pickles ! high quality foods and cold nitro brew on tap . friendly staff . word has it a nano brewery will open 3 doors down further enhancing this revitalized neighborhood . all hail public transit , it 's having a profound effect on phoenix and the surrounding cities like mesa . lots of other good food items , too . whole takeaway rotisserie chickens . fair prices !
american	the menu is full of healthy & not so healthy choices , but all of the food is really fresh and promptly served by their friendly staff . i went with the more cow bell which is egg fried rice , teriyaki filet mignon , cauliflower & peppers . it was excellent . i can 't wait to go back .
american	it is a bit trendy ... but that 's ok ( as long as that 's what you 're looking for ) . i ate at the bar and the bartender was awesome ... as was the food .
american	also good for meal after pursuing the entertainment district . went for winterlicious 2015 , the broccoli kingdom salad and baked cod were delicious . the snores brownie was yummy , however it was supposed to come with a marshmallow and didn 't . that didn 't spoil the meal though . the service was incredibly friendly and efficient . will definitely eat here again .
american	i like that its student run and a different set of options each day . however meals are very overpriced , and i wonder who is turning a profit .
american	its better than the other bww i 've been to , and i 've been to a lot of them ! great bartenders during the week but the 2 girls who work on the weekend or nights just don 't cut it . they 're to slow and leave you sitting there twittling your thumbs waiting for service . besides that this place is great ! i love just hanging out watching the games over beer and wings . spicy garlic ! ! ! ! ! !
american	a bonus to sit out on their beautiful patio on a warm evening . burger was excellent and the fries delicious and can be shared .
american	they were able to accommodate my group of 8 without a reservation , no problem . service was fine , the server communicated with us if an entree was going to be a while etc .... their almond chicken fingers and truffle fries are delicious ! portions are a good size as well . expect an average dinner with a drink to cost around the $ 30 mark
american	everyone is super friendly ! b ) buffalo chicken pizza is outstanding . i was skeptical at first with the french fries on it , but it was amazing .
american	i 've been coming here on and off for years now and every time i come back the menu is always the same . the prime rib above average , the cafe is a way better alternative to the buffet . great way to spend your comp .
american	cooked perfectly . i also had the onion rings and i loved it . atmosphere was very nice , every table had a candle on it . my server knew the menu and each steak should be cooked . come early the place gets packed fast .
american	do not miss the gumbo , and tomato salad for starters . i love the bone in ribeye , and the bone in prime rib . i have not been to delmonico 's in quite a few years . as usual emeril lagasse 's restaurants never disappoint me , i once again enjoyed my meal . the ribeye here is beyond compare . for dessert do not miss emeril 's banana creme pie--my all-time favorite dessert . bam !
american	if you are staying at the hotel , bring your coupon book . you can get a free bottle of wine with two paid entrees . we had the salmon and the filet trio and they were both fabulous ! the ambience is nice , service is good and you can 't beat the price point !
american	great service ! perhaps the best creamed spinach in the country ! pricey food . a good , albeit pricey wine list . but , this place is simply excellent for steakhouse cuisine , suck it up and pay for the quality ....
american	service is always impeccable , a killer bone-in ribeye , and a wonderful salad / soup bar ( that is included with your meal ) . honestly ? you don 't really need a starch to accomany your slab o 'meat , the salad / soup bar will suffice ; along with the yummy bread basket of course . i 've never had a sub-par meal here ; and in fact , the family has started to include the broiler as part of any celebratory meal . good times , really good food .
american	the service was exceptional and the food was all delicious ! be sure to try one of their specialty cocktails . the prices were a bit steep , but that 's to be expected at a steakhouse in vegas . the side dishes were really small ( think 5 pieces of asparagus on a plate ) , so order accordingly . all in all , good food if you are looking for more than a vegas buffet .
american	the service was amazing and the food was superb . i ordered a mignonette and it was cooked just the way i asked . sides and salads were just right . a great experience from beginning to end ! : )
american	nice ambiance and decor . i came hear to eat at one of my favorites " 3950 " but when mgm bought mandalay they replaced it with stripsteak but while apprehensive i finally tried it . awesome ! i miss 3950 but i really liked this place . the menu was full of things ill go back for some day but the kobe fillet and duck fries were pretty right on . had the mac n ' cheese and some sort of bourbon pudding thing for dessert . it was all without complaint . the wait staff was very attractive and very polite . went back to eat there about a year ago and couldn 't get a last minute reservation so tried the striphouse .....
american	there were two of us and we waited about 10 minutes for a table . they called us by our surname once our table was ready . it was a busy night which made it a bit loud . i had the filet mignon rare and it was one of the best i ever ate . all of the food was very good and the service was excellent .
american	we called to enquire about reservations after our hike , and despite it being within the hour , they were happy to reserve a table for us . service was great and so was the food . wonderful burgers and fries , with cold beer to wash it all down . we missed out on trying the black deer burger , as they were sold out , but everything else we ordered was spot on and delicious .
american	there are multiple beer choices on tap . they do have a nice happy hour with six dollar appetizers at the bar . i recommend the sliders for happy hour . i also really like their mojito 's , they use fresh fruit for the berry mojito . also , they aren 't skimpy with the alcohol in their drinks .
american	i can 't complain about $ 13.95 for a buffet that gets you through to dinner without feeling hungry again . ( especially when eating at panda express costs about the same price ! ) and if you show up towards the end of breakfast ( 10 : 30ish ) - you get to eat the extras they put out for the lunch crowd at the breakfast price . don 't know about any of the other meals , but i would definitely recommend the breakfast buffet at bellagio .
american	this is clearly a locals favorite . if your looking for a good diner with lots if food and good service , this is your spot . the decor is simple and reminds you of " middle america . " the waitress was very friendly and accommodating to our slightly complicated ordering . it is cash only so be sure to stop by an atm if need be . overall , great experience .
american	locations are always busy it seems however its a quick " in and out " for a burger . great sauce as well , no mustard / ketchup / pickle offered on the burgers , but since there are not any in-n-out burgers in ohio , its always glad to try something new . surely we will be back !
american	they have half off drinks and appitizers before 10 . we started out with there limelight martini. which was delicious . we tried the spinach and artichoke dip , one word , amazing ! we also had the pizza , which was lacking but still good , and the beef dipping sticks tasted great . the " dipping sause " itself is nothing too exciting . i recommend trying this place , great service , hip decor , and an amazing happy hour .
american	wedding soup is the tastiest around- it never gets a chance to sit around and get salty like all the other places . in fact out if all the places for wedding soup , my wife said this is the closest to her grandmothers .
american	i like the fact that they offer to toast ( not forced on you like quiznos ) .
american	the staff was welcoming and accomodating after overcoming limited parking . we were surprised at the selection of beer and food . excellent shrimp pizza ! new belgium 1554 is a black lager that is not easy to find outside of denver but hob nobbs came through !
american	drinks made with perfection ! i really enjoyed my long island the other day ! and recently a wonderful creamsicle ! lovely establishment !
american	we have driven by this converted ihop several times and decided to stop in today for lunch . what a great surprise . the food and service were both beyond excellent . the lunch specials had great flavors and were very reasonably priced and the service was impeccable . we will definitely return ! !
american	when your there be sure to say hello to bobbi , she 's super friendly and will make your day !
american	surprisingly the best thing they offer is a huge and delicious greek salad with grilled chicken and feta . can feed two people , delicious and very filling !
american	love the gyros platter with the rice and greek lemon potatoes . in addition to the gyros the cheesecake is to die for !
american	located in the mall area between the paris hotel and ballys is this great spot ! juicy burgers with great fries . they also have a fantastic happy hour with drink specials . will defiantly go back . skip the lunch buffett one day and head there instead .
american	the service is excellent . the best hot dog i 've had in a while . i will definitely be back .
american	so many things on the menu that i love . top 5 items : breakfast veggie burrito , greek wrap , chicken club sandwich , turkey melt , and greek salad . these are my go to and are always on point . also their salsa is delicious . not really spicy , but full of flavor ! the staff is super friendly and helpful .
american	the bartenders were attentive , we were seated as per our reservation with no waiting , and the ice bar is pretty cool . we enjoyed the tasting menu of vodka as well as some martinis . the foie gras and the lobster bisque were excellent , the side asparagus was perfect , and the filet excellent . for what we ordered , we thought the price was right - this is high end food , you pay the price . we would absolutely go back . moe the bartender was very helpful as well !
american	i try to buy fresh produce whenever i can and what a better place to do it than on an actual working farm . the owner is so friendly and went out of his way to make sure we had what we needed . since they are selling christmas trees at this time of the year , they had leftover trimmed branches which he gave to me for free ! i came home and made wreaths and centerpieces with them . i will definitely return here for the many family festivals they have going on here year around .
american	full service and not a 1 : 15 waite . sit at the bar leah m . will give you the attention and detail . the food is a piece of utter magnificence . the service is unrivaled . the only thing id worry about is the fact their are no misters on the porch ateas . hopefully . they wont make the mistake of no misters so 15 tables outside will be comfortable in 115 degree weather .
american	i especially love the cup cake pancakes breakfast . this visit amazing because they knew i bacon crisp . i will definitely would like to come back soon for another breakfast .
american	food , service top notch for us ( party of 7 ) ambience outstanding . wine list is small , but has good choices . prices not cheap , but on par for this class of restaurant . loved , will definitely go back .
american	speaking of which , get the meat platter which will not disappoint ! the brisket is my favourite thing on that platter , the fried chicken is also good , but wish it wasn 't boneless breast meat ... fried chicken should be about the legs and thighs in my opinion . the kfc ( korean fried cauliflower ) is to die for . good for large groups and birthdays since this place has a lot of seating and a cool vibe . cocktails are also good !
american	i 'm from out of state and tried this on a whim , worth every penny . very good food - enough on the menu if you don 't feel like the burger . i had the pulled pork sandwich - amazing ! fast & friendly service as well . highly recommend .
american	this restaurant is always a good choice . they are regularly changing up their menu and offering different dishes that combine classic italian cuisine with a unique take . the osabosuca is always a good choice along with their risotto . portions are plentiful and the staff is more than welcoming . a great spot for a quick lunch or a long dinner . prices are moderate , but you 'll get your money 's worth !
american	don 't expect much from the decor - but the food is fresh , served up with great service and pretty decent coffee . it surprises me how many restaurants decline altering their dishes to make it a bit more healthy . my lovely server this morning didn 't even bat an eyelash and changed up the potatoes and toast for a side serving of veggies instead . they also added an extra egg without having been asked . if you 're in ajax / durham area , don 't go to cora 's overpriced breakfast factory , come here instead .
american	great place to celebrate an anniversary or a nice date night . relaxed atmosphere and great food with a good bit of outdoor dining space .
american	my husband and i got 2 combos for basically $ 20 , which doesn 't even happen at mcdonald 's anymore . we got a classic and jalapeño and honey sandwich with coleslaw and potato salad and soft drinks . there really isn 't any place to sit and eat , but we were fortunate to go on a nice day and ate at trinity bellwoods park . the sandwiches were delicious and huge ! extremely fresh and crisp and hot even after walking to the park . they use boneless chicken thigh so the sandwich is flavourful and juicy . both salads were just ok , but we would definitely come back for the chicken !
american	i came at around 11 : 30 am and got in just before the lunch rush . i started off with a lemonade which was really good and really refreshing on a hot day . i ordered a reuben which was beautifully toasted on some delicious rye bread . the pastrami has some bits of fattiness which was an interesting but tasty surprise . the sandwich was nicely balanced by the sauerkraut and russian dressing . the fries have some nice cajun type seasoning and reminds me of the cajun fries from five guys .
american	no huge casino to walk through . just park and right in the door to start the only hard part of the meal , deciding what to order . do i get breakfast , dinner , tri-tip , should i have onion rings or save room for their huge " pies-for-one " enjoy your decision and your meal .
american	the atmosphere is perfect . feels like a european get away .
american	the mushroom galaxy burger was phenomenal and filling ; i didn 't try the fries ( low carb diet ) but i did get the quinoa chili yummmm ! counter service and complimentary lemon / lime water ! the weather was beautiful so i sat outside ! noon hits and it gets packed ! just goes to show how delicious healthy food is !
american	endless coffee cup and superb service . i rate this restaurant a ten and i will be back .
american	charming setting , family-owned , friendly staff ( even met the chef ) . would not take my grandchildren or husband . very much the perfect place to visit with friends while dining on superb food . do not skip dessert !
american	we had our son 's first birthday party there and chef / owner raj was very nice and accommodating . he prepared a set menu to our liking and budget , was very flexible with little extras like printing the set menus , birthday cake and decorations . he even personally brought out the cake . the staff is super friendly and very helpful . the event was everything we had hoped for and even more ! they have the best pizza and grilled calamari in town ! ! we also had shrimp linguini and grilled chicken on our menu and got excellent feedback from our guests . highly recommended ! p.s not such a big fan of the veal though
american	we love it . prices are fair , games are good ... the atmosphere is loud , so never a problem bringing very young kids . located at tempe marketplace , its a great bargaining chip when trying to shop with your kids .
american	i ate the say uncle sausage and my friend ordered a cheesesteak crepe . the crepe was especially tasty with a really savory sauce on it . i would recommend this place for anyone looking for a good brunch spot in the burgh ! if you 're sick of pamela 's go check out square cafe !
american	my husband had a burger and it was absolutely the best he has had in a long time . plump and juicy meat that was flavorful . a rare find at this price point . cobb salad was tasty and fresh greens . plenty of crunch . the wine is an average merlot that should be chilled a bit . all in all a great place that we will return to . looking forward to trying the friday night fishfry . perhaps we will be able to move from 4 to 5 stars !
american	the sandwiches are on the sweet side ( lots of sugary sauces ) but they are tasty . love the locally roasted coffee and the cookies .
american	? their taters / maters / beans are surprisingly decadent , and their french toast is drenched in blueberry sauce and goat cheese . definitely the most unique part is the donuts , and they have about 10 crazy flavors ( we got a pepper corn parmesan that was delicious , and nice to slather our eggs onto ) . saturday brunch is less crowded than sunday . enjoy !
american	a group of 4 , we chose the prix fixe tasting menu . my wife had the quail and i the poached oysters for the first course and both were outstanding . for the second course , my wife had the foie gras and i the turbot - both were excellent . i usually stay away from anything liver , but was surprised at the delicate flavor and richness of the foie gras - i guess that 's why people like it so much . the third course , we both had the fallow deer medallions paired with a delicious malbec blend , a definite 5 star course . i finished with a sauternes .
american	it 's his favorite restaurant . i arrived a little early and had the chance to chat with italian-born gm toni who promised me a complimentary dessert . then he introduced me to his wife and head waitress janina . what a great pair ! their service and hospitality made my birthday special ..... and they gave me a very special birthday surprise ! ! the food was exquisite , the servings generous and i had something to take home . this is a hidden gem . please say hello to my new friends when you come here for your special dinner or lunch .... gary
american	a little pricey , but it 's all worth it . their pot of breads are worth it alone !
american	tons of local brews and great local fare make this a must visit . great fish fry , and a really cool atmosphere in the heart of madison . offers good selection of beer , and some great local foods .
american	looking for some bbq while in scottsdale . went with a friend . we both had the ribs . i had fries with mine and she had cole slaw and beans . ribs came out with no sauce no sauce on them , which was perfect . after all , why hide the flavor with sauce . ribs had a nice rub on them and the meat just peeled off the bone . fries were good and i used them to try the various sauces which all had their unique flavors . as another reported , the sweet tea was good also . unfortunately by the time we came to eat , all the desserts were sold out .
american	the menu is perfect and balanced with yummy goodness ! we are soooo lucky to have b. p. so close ! ! ! !
american	the fun thing about intermezzo is that it has a cozy , laid back international feel to it . the inside is small so big groups will have to sit outside .
american	fez is awesome ! great food & drink specials , excellent service , and a fun comfortable atmosphere ...
american	poached eggs are perfect , orange juice freshly squeezed . yum !
american	a little spendy . not cheap . but real tasty . the family meal is the bomb but again not cheap . the loaded potato is my favorite . yum ! !
american	this place has an at-home feel to it and a modern look on the inside that i loved. the menu consisted of many options from pancakes to crepes to omelets. was most impressed with how patient the staff was when my friend chuckled and told me this cafe closes at 3 ... & it was 2 : 25 ! always hate being ' that customer ' but the server was a delight the whole time . 10 / 10 would recommend !
american	yum ! i got a hot walter white in a mug ! amazing ! i love sunrise coffee & makers & finders ... but this is my new west side go-to ! ! delicious coffee with warmer , happier vibe than sambalatte ! i will be back ! !
american	airport everything is synonymous with sort of sucky and great lakes bucks that trend . i had a hoagie and a big ol cup of pills and was more less pleased with both . the hoagie is pretty drippy and is more of a fork and knife affair . it 's not fantastic but once again , in the spectrum of airport food it 's good . if you 're familiar with great lakes beer , you know it 's pretty solid . i 'm not huge on their ipa but i think their pils is great . almost tastes as good as some of the pacific nw varieties
american	the food was perfectly prepared , and tasty . the complimentary homemade soups available , while the order is prepared , is a nice touch . the high def tv showing a tour of the greek isles should be much bigger , but it is a great addition to the dining area . the decor is pleasant with photos and paintings showcasing greece make it very inviting . if you are tired of the same old food fair in arizona , stop by this little family run establishment . with the friendly staff , the delicious food , and the relaxed atmosphere , you will leave with a smile on your face . it 's as good as it gets . you won 't be disappointed .
american	delicious . nice skewer of fresh fruit to start . can 't believe no one mentioned the bathrooms . definitely be sure to use the facilities .
american	this is a classic mississauga dive ! a total truckers stop . open late , great for cheap but large portioned meats , diner-style breakfast , poutine , souvlaki . it 's an order-at-the-counter type joint , so no wait service .
american	we went for breakfast and ate so much , i made myself sick . dang , this ruined me for the next couple of days . though we were eating breakfast , they had a stack of short ribs on a grill that i couldn 't resist and that was my doom , just couldn 't stop . though we didn 't try everything on the buffet , you can 't go wrong here there is one bad thing we will not try again and that 's the bloody mary and the mimosa . no flavor and probably the worst we had in vegas
american	had a really bad experience with a rude owner / manager that acted as if he was doing us a favor to let us consider dining there . finally got there sunday with the family and must say the food was great . my wife and i are always seeking out good prime rib and this was the best we 've had in years . entire party enjoyed the food . set your bar low on service sad to say , but they can cook a steak !
american	if you want a couple of gyros to take out pretty quickly , this , is the place . sure , it looks worn out , but but it is what it is . gyros , were good . some days you don 't want fancy lol .
american	brisket is really amazing - not to be missed . i am not usually a brisket lover . pork was pulled too finely for my preference but still very tasty . sauce was really good , especially on the brisket . i had greens and baked beans . the collards were my favorite of the two .
american	yum ! the beers are fantastic and burgers are excellent . i always leave here too full and promise to split a burger upon my return , but between visits i lose my resolve and rinse and repeat . this is a testament to the delicious food and beer !
american	and i like that they show the calories per item .
american	everything was cooked to order for us . i had the mediterranean plate and my husband had the chicken shawarma and we were both pleasantly surprised . the food is very fresh and the falafel were wonderful . the owners were very kind too . we will definitely be back .
american	something nice about this super target . leaving a review to back up the other ! ! my only gripe is i spend to much at targer . or my wife does anyway ! ! !
american	well the grilled cheese here will make you forget you ever had that . smoked cheddar on a amazing bread with just the right amount of butter grilled to perfection . next time goat cheese with bacon .
american	friendly staff and retro atmosphere . a treat . i would recommend sitting close to a jukebox . i paid for a song and after our entire dining experience , right before i left , it came on . thanks 5
american	service for large parties at most restaurants is slooow , but boy , not here ! friendly , efficient wait staff ; waters and drinks constantly refilled without having to ask , and the kitchen had our orders out all at once and in a timely manner. i 've eaten at the cave creek restaurant a number of times , and consistently had excellent , friendly service . and the food is great ! everything i 've had there is yummy . lots of menu choices ; hard to choose ... i recommend it highly .
american	many had not tried russian food or that type of dining experience ; about a third of the table had . it was an amazing time . the owner and staff treated us like royalty and the food was amazing ! meatloaf wellington and the russian salad ( and of course , the caviar and vodka ) we standouts . we all had a great time and everyone will be back !
american	the service was amazing ! a waitress who i wish i got her name helped us out and she was awesome ! she opened the back are just for our party and left it closed just for us . we were away from the front with all the crowd we felt special . the food was great everyone enjoyed their meals . our waitress even helped me out with getting a candle and brownie cake to sing for my husbands bday . i can 't wait to go back ! ! !
american	began with an omelette station . the chef was rock n rolling using 3 omelette pans at a time . the omelette was fluffy and delicious . also , choice of bacon , sausage , hash browns , biscuits & gravy . chicken fajitas , assorted pastries , fresh fruit salad , and deserts . service was very good . i believe price was $ 9.99 . we will definitely be back .. job well done !
american	we each got the pulled pork sandwich , and each of us got a different side . we were all very pleased with our selections . the pulled pork was a generous portion and offered with slaw on it or on the side . there are a number of different sauces on the table so you can flavor your sandwich how you like it . for sides we had : bbq cole slaw - good , served chilled with a nice bbq zing sweet potato fries - crispy and hot baked beans with sausage - nicely flavored beans our server was lela and she was efficient , cheery , and delightful !
american	i had to tell you guys how impressed i was with rashers . the dining in experience , service , and food quality was top notch ! one of the best experiences i had on my road trip . i will totally recommend rasher and will make a point of returning ! thanks for a great memory ! !
american	the food was good and surprisingly very inexpensive . it 's rare that i find a good breakfast place with turkey sausage so i was impressed . we were seated immediately and our food came really quick . i will be dining here again when we return .
american	overall the service and food were absolutely great . we began with the plateau , a great dish of you like seafood . everything was fresh and complimented each other well . i had the chicken , which was fantastic . others had the halibut , the filet , and a special , the beef duo . everyone seemed to love what they had . the desserts were great . i loved the raspberry-pistachio and others loved the sorbets . just a great place . easy viewing access to the lake and the show that comes on every so often as well .
american	after sightseeing , we decided upon veneto 's for dinner based on the yelp reviews . the service was fantastic , our waiter was wonderful and so attentive . the food was just as great as the service ! i had the integrali caprese pasta with spaghetti . all of us in our group enjoyed our meals and were all impressed with the wonderful service . since i do travel to area for work i will definitely make it a point to come to veneto again .
american	nothing fancy to look at and a bit smokey in the bar area but in the restaurant not bad . the food was really good and in large servings . we had jambalaya that was pretty spicy but good , seafood tacos , steak and shrimp , linguini and clams and a shrimp , crab and lobster louie . not a complaint in this group of critical eaters . even two of us went back for breakfast and enjoyed it completely . a definite do again . service was fast and friendly .
american	a group of 5 of us went after working @ the cne casino until the wee hours of the morning to have breakfast before heading to bed .... the place has a lot of character and looks like it has seen better days but the reputation for the quality of foods allows most to overlook the decor or lack there of ... i had an incredible appetite and ordered the ossington massive ... it was all i expected and then some ... service was very good and the entire group was impressed with their breakfasts as well ...
american	the service was excellent both at the bar and dining room . our waitress helped steer the table away from a few dishes to make sure we hit the highlights . the food is not molecular science but it is good mid west meal . it brought me back to my childhood with the 4 courses ; salad bar , cup of soup , starch and entree . our table all had steaks or prime rib and each as cook properly and not over done . also the large steins of beer were a great touch . we want to come back for a friday fish fry .
american	we ordered 3 to share and there was no way we were going to finish those , even given our best effort ! and that was really sad , because they were to die for . red velvet ..... i dream of you . no charge for tap water , but they did have a convenience fee , but who cares . vegas will nickel and dime you , get over it . price was fair for what you got , which was a sh * * ton of delicious ice cream for about twelve or thirteen bucks ( depending what you order ) . i will get me another red velvet sundae , count on that .
american	the atmosphere is great , the food was wonderful , and they do have an unbelievable drink menu i dive into the calamari fritti and fettucine alla rivera . both were super tasty and i wanted more even though i was stuffed . we still managed to order coffee drinks afterwards and they were better than some other places in the area . i don 't know what espresso they use but it was awesome . our waiter was personable , funny , and provided above average service . will definitely go back in june when up in the area for work again .
american	service was friendly and good ! i had the two eggs your way with bacon and then also split biscuits and gravy with someone else . portion sizes were great and you could easily share something . if i 'm back on that side of town i will certainly be back .
american	while it was extremely crowded , we had quick service and fantastic food . the fried feta in phyllo was fantastic , as was my filet mignon stroganoff . everyone enjoyed their meal , and it was a great way to kick off new years eve ! can 't wait to get back , and try some more fantastic grub !
american	this is a small intimate place and the tables are spaced nicely and not crammed . the staff was very friendly and attentive . the salads were served on chilled plates . i had the rack of lamb and it was probably the best i ever had and my husband had the filet and both were cooked to perfection . a house salad and two sides are included with the meal which is a plus ( don 't see that often ) . do not miss this little " diamond in the rough . " a nice perk ... it is a byob . i will definitely return .
american	we were all pleasantly surprised by the large portions and how delicious everything looked and tasted ! their food was much better than other comparable local restaurants . i had one of their signature pizzas found on the menu , chicken , spinach , pesto ! yum !
american	the food was delicious , service great and the value was spot on . i 'd recommend this place for breakfast .
american	we had wonderful , friendly and fast service . food was great ! really cute little cafe .
american	i was leery based on reviews but everything was great . we got to sit in the cool " catamaran boat " table , waitress was awesome . food and drinks were good and i liked the singer / guitar player .
american	for the most part , i think everyone was happy with their meal . i got the gnocchi and added chicken , and it was delicious . i tried the chicken from the chicken and waffles , and it had a sweetness to the breading that was amazing . some of us also got the bottomless mimosas , and they were not stingy with them at all . we were there for over 2 hours , and they kept refiling even after we 'd paid . excellent service , great food . highly recommended .
american	we sat upstairs which overlooked the entire bar . look at the menu before you venture here . lots of pork / steak . the chicken wings are a must have . they are well flavored and fall right off the bone . wait staff is great . drinks mixed well . service tip top .
american	inspired , delicious meals including an extensive list of specialty sushi rolls and gourmet burger combinations . there is something for everyone with a discerning palate . i eat here frequently . favorites include the california dream roll , vive la burger and slamon blt . bread puddings are my favorites desserts .
american	their bellflower basil drink was really delicious ( vodka , grapefruit juice , and basil ) ! i ended up having 3 of them , and probably could have had another but they ran out of grapefruit juice . i also really enjoyed the calamari appetizer ! i rarely see students in here however , despite the fact that it is inside the university center . i think that 's because it is fancy looking and unless you 're there for happy hour it is a bit more money than most students want to spend . i think we 'll be back though !
american	we had called earlier in the day to make sure that we could be accommodated . the restaurant had no problem . we were seated in our own little area and had two amazing servers , breanna and erika . these two worked hard but they were fabulous . the burgers everyone said were amazing as well. thank you and an a + + to the restaurant and the staff .
american	there are 8 of us with quite varied taste buds , so it can be difficult to please us all -- but the phoenix public market café delivered . i got a burger , which was fantastic , and other members of our group also raved about their soup , breakfast options , and salads . but - the one thing you cannot leave here without is one of their homemade pop-tarts . yes , you read right . homemade pop tarts . flaky , crispy , golden pastry layers filled with fruit and topped with perfectly sweet icing . perfection .
american	this bar is one of the best place for people watching . the butter cake is the most amazing dessert ever . our tab for 4 cocktails and 4 desserts was about $ 120 , not including tip . little pricy , but worth doing once a quarter . on a side note , i have been to this location multiple times . the food and service have never disappointed . the filet and lobster mash are my favorite . they do a nice presentation if you tell them it is your birthday .
american	everyone was satisfied ! the menu was huge and interesting , with a lot of great flavor combinations . they even have a build your own section if you don 't like any of the suggested options . everything was cooked nicely and tasted good . service was a little slow but it was pretty busy . all around a positive experience and we would go back .
american	we all enjoyed the very french menu with hints of quebecois and north african fare on the menu . i think the chef is from quebec and he seems to know his way around the kitchen . first thing to mention is the portion sizes . ridiculously generous . in fact , if you have a moderate appetite i 'd suggest splitting the main . overall , salads and main dishes were all well enjoyed . atmosphere is ok , small place , pretty simple decor . service was very good . priices were reasonable . would go again .
american	although the location is pretty far away from downtown , this place is worth coming to ! the poutine was fantastic . we also tried the deep fried oreos , which i would highly recommend . the decor is rustic and modern . there is a large amount of seating and the staff are more than happy to accommodate large groups . one of my favourite poutines . i can 't wait to experience more of their awesome menu . le gras dur , i will be back ! ! !
american	it was my first time , but it 's been one of her favorite vegas steak joints for awhile now . first , our waiter " hammer " is freaking amazing . my favorites were : appetizers : pork belly bacon , bone marrow , shellfish tower main : wagyu rib eye cap with scallops side : potato gratin , mac and cheese dessert : sorbets
american	i ordered several of their " absolute mess " cocktails because they were wicked delicious and relatively inexpensive . we also ordered their loaded tots and poutine . i was impressed with the poutine , which is saying something since i lived in maine for a while and have definitely eaten a lot of poutine in my day ! even the next morning when i finished up my leftover starch , cheese , and gravy , they were still super delicious ! our waitress was also very attentive even though they were quite busy .
american	there is a great happy hour that lasts until 9 pm and it covers entrees , appetizers and drinks . i was able to eat and drink for about $ 14 and i even took home leftovers . the atmosphere is fun and the waitstaff was friendly and very capable . i plan to go back again , loved it !
american	i feel like this place may have been a bit over rated : ( . anyway , it has a very interesting feeling--- seems like it may have formerly been a book store ? i loved the style though . the pork chop was my least favorite , the flavor was there it was just not moist enough . idk maybe i 'm just too picky . however , the drink yes ya 'am was something else . it blew my mind ! i strongly recommend it , only if you 're into sweetness . otherwise you should try their blueberry cider . super yummy also !
american	the food was fantastic , and our server gave us great suggestions . portion size is pretty good , and we all left happy and full . delicious wine , food and service .
american	after the race , and eating nothing but fast food for the last 3 days we needed a nice sit down restaurant . of course we found the creekside on yelp ! , and decided to give it a try . definitely a five star for the price . the food was very good . the service was great . if i ever find myself near brecksville , oh again i would definitely go back .
american	the service was great and the food was even better . a couple of us had the ahi tuna salad which fantastic . some also had the bad girl pasta and cleaned their plates . we were too full for dessert but were definitely tempted . will definitely come back when we 're back in montreal !
american	i am so glad that we did ! they have a great little patio we sat at , and the service was quick and genuine . everyone in our group was impressed with how delicious the food was ! their pierogies are easily the best i 've ever had , and their fish tacos are delicious as well . several people in our group had the sweet & spicy bacon skewers and could not stop talking about how good they were , so i would recommend trying those ! i will definitely be back here next time i 'm in pittsburgh , there were so many items on the menu i 'd like to try !
american	we all ordered different burgers and when they came out we indulged .... all quiet .... eating ... we all agreed .... delicious ! reminded me of my roots in wisconsin at a local mom and pop bar .... great burgers ... neighborhood feel ... comfort food at its best ... but sitting on the patio had great mountain views ....
american	bottomless mimosas , amazing cuisine , and great staff . the new dessert menu was incredible . highly recommend for a date night , birthday , engagement party and the list continues .
american	the cool started with the bartender 's bruno mars-like cocktail shaking . moved on to the retro sinatra-inspiring dining room . then had excellent service by israel and nice wine list . the food was really good , too . i tried the lobster mac & cheese , which i liked . i really liked the panzanella salad . we then went to the main bar , which was a scene out of pulp fiction . we danced to some music i have never heard before and enjoyed some great people watching . i would definitely recommend another evening at this place .
american	i got the turkey burger ( i can 't remember the name of it ) and fries and each of my girlfriends got something different . the only thing one of the complained about was the macaroni and cheese but other than that everyone was satisfied . in particular one friend had the cucumber salad and it was very delicious . the dressing in which they use is what makes the salad so good . the only thing i 'd add is a gluten free bun . but otherwise it was all very good .
american	three courses and a glass of wine was included for $ 30 ! total steal if you ask me . for my first course i chose the beet salad which was very tasty . second course i got the hanger steak and oh my goodness it was yummy ! they had four options for dessert so we each got one so we could try them all . none of them were short of amazing ! ! ! couldn 't have asked for a better dining experience there .
american	fyi the blackberry lemonade is to diiiiie for- i order it every time we go . they have delicious healthy options to eat as well ! something for everyone
american	this establishment is only open for dinner as well to those who are considering attending . my rating is based on the food ; the food was so good that it over-shadowed the poor service . i believe that we just got stuck with a slow waiter that even as i observed the other patrons eating and receiving their meals . as with everything inside the aira , this place is pricy . definitely attend with a group where the bill can be split evenly . i had the " mustard marinated black cod " dinner ; comes with creamed corn and marbled potatoes for $ 54 dollars . the meal was a decent size and fulfilling , not to mention absolutely mouth watering .
american	the service has always been great and polite , they just redid the inside to include better seating , and the best part is that they can split your check to any number of members . we 're going to miss the one server they had there though as she would know our usual order and bring us a round of mt . dews , 2 8th wonders , and a side of bread sticks without even asking if we needed menus .
american	we were seated on time , everyone was very nice . our server , jocelyn , was amazing and answered all of our questions . she recommended the 3 course meal which was the special that night . she was absolutley right , the food was so delicious ! it 's hard to get good seafood , especially in pgh , and it was all so amazing ! i will definitley be back . the atmosphere and great and i also can 't forget to mention the coctails ... all good things !
american	the service was very good . the food was really good . and to top off the amazing meal we had our choice of birthday desserts ... seriously ? very generous and delicious .
american	i got a falafel , it was huge but the falafels were cold : ( other than that it was great , and you can 't beat the price . with a bottle of soda , my total came up to something like $ 7 . i also love their myspace website - they list the hours , menu with prices and etc . all extremely useful .
american	and if your server is leslie , you are in for a treat - tip her well , she 'll deserve it .
american	the portions were very generous and the food was very good . the brussel sprouts were the best i 've ever tasted . the vegetarian options that didn 't include starch was limited . this is not a calorie conscience menu so plan to splurge if you go here . the service was excellent . we especially appreciated them splitting the check for us ; that was an unexpected bonus . the only comment i could make is that we were annoyed to have to navigate by smokers both coming in and exiting the restaurant . overall a fun night out !
american	we had such an amazing experience . from the food to our wonderful server / bartender jessica . we did not leave disappointed . everything was delicious , jessica was extremely knowledgable on the cocktail menu as well as the dinner menu . definitely a gem hidden on east blvd .
american	atmosphere is wonderful and food was delicious . i loved the banana bread pancakes and my girlfriend loved the lemon ricotta waffles . also tried the lavender honey iced latte and it was great . the service was friendly and upbeat , food came very fast , and the chef checked on our table multiple times . what a great addition to a wonderful neighborhood , we 'll be back !
american	i just needed to update that i am not a fan of most veggie pizzas , but the veggie pizza here was so great & filling , i actually didn 't miss the meat ! the mushrooms & tomatoes were great ... actually , now that i think about it , the lack of green veggies but the variety of others was what made this pizza so awesome . as always , the staff rocks .
american	we had heard nothing but great things and were anxious to go . the new location is fantastic . a very classy and beautiful atmosphere . if someone asked if it were fancy , i would say yes . although , not the kind of fancy that they focus on presentation more than the portions . the portions were big , the quality was great and very tasteful . the service was incredible as well . we had tate wait on us and he was very educated , informative and helpful . you could tell that the staff worked well together to make everyones experience top notch . we had a wonderful night out and will definitely be coming back !
american	we 'd all heard about it and some have visited here before . wow ! what a difference from simmons . the décor is absolutely beautiful , even the bathroom is very nice and clean . i had blackened salmon , sweet potatoes and string beans . everything was delicious . the salmon was so tender . everyone at the table seemed to enjoy their food . we loved talking to our waitress who was from france . i 'd heard varying reviews of the restaurant . all restaurants have to work out their kinks . this was my first time visiting and i was very impressed . we will definitely be back .
american	both food and drinks were great ! the sampler of ( 5 ) beers was a good choice . you can or can 't go wrong ordering samplers its just how it is but the price here was too good ! and being familiar with beer makes it more assuring . i 'll go back .
american	the food was fantastic and our server , chance was phenomenal ! liza was a sweetheart as well . highly recommend the mash potato omelette , but don 't tell anyone about it . lol
american	besides the outrageous bar tab , the food and service were excellent . the waitstaff managed us well with attentive service to an unruly group . the food was excellent to boot .
american	very cool decor , tables and giant sized booth . there was six of us and we all fit in the booth . plus the booth had a tv which was playing hockey ! i had the hangover burger and not only was it delicious it actually worked ( could have been a placebo ) but whatever works . great place to grab some food !
american	this is a sexy restaurant located in the palms hotel . we made a reservation and were seated on time . we enjoyed our white table cloth service . our waiter was friendly and professional . the cocktails were delightful ! my cucumber martini was perfect ! i shared the yelp pics and reviews with everyone so that we could decided what to order . because the sides feed 2-3 people , we were able to sample many . i was surprised to heard hip hop music played during dinner but we loved it ! no one ordered dessert because we were full from the entree .
american	there was a dozen of us , with significant appetites which porchetta & co. sated . a short , simple , yet delicious menu adorns the wall with a single daily special that rotates . our group was served in good time even considering the place was packed when we arrived . the sandwich is homey , fresh , and delightful to bite into . i 've been multiple times and always been pleased .
american	i was with a group of guys drinking for 6 hours surrounded by servers dressed in short kilts , baring midriffs , and massive amounts of cleavage , of course they loved it . we came during happy hour where domestic beers were $ 3 , imports were $ 5 and almost all appetizers were $ 5 . awesome place to hang out , drink , and much .
american	the place was packed . no wonder . the food was great . i had the souvlaki on a bun and it was tender and well seasoned . good fries too . all 4 of us were happy with our meal . can 't wait to return and try something new at this little neighbourhood eatery
american	the food was delicious . we started off with the large hummus and warm pita bread . that appetizer is a must . a few people had the greek salad with gyro meat . i had the chicken kabobs and others had the gyro sandwich with fries . my kabobs were outstanding and everyone enjoyed there food too . the service was a little slow , but i will excuse it since the place was full of people .
american	the prices were great , food was tasty , the service was excellent , and they even treated us to some complimentary desserts ! we came here for breakfast the next morning with a smaller group and really enjoyed it as well . i would recommend coming to talking stick for a small get-together with friends , and coming to blue coyote cafe is a good idea for those not wanting to spend too much money yet still have a tasty meal .
american	you can defiantly see that they take pride in their food and also use high quality foods . everything seemed fresh , beer selection was small but solid , mixed drinks were very good especially the cucumber cooler . burgers here were perfectly cooked to you liking and fries were homemade and excellent . i had the full pig which was enough for 2 but very good . overall a great brunch spot .
american	great atmosphere and well-maintained tables . mitch , our usual bartender , is super attentive and a great dude . if you have a chance to swing by late on a weekday , check this place out .
american	it was a great pre-game spot ! we were seated promptly , and the service was great . they serve brunch on the weekends before 2 pm , and they have a bloody mary bar , which was a fun surprise . there 's a variety of brunch items to choose from , and everyone in our group really enjoyed their food , especially the waffle slider and pierogie dish . i also was thrilled they had a few healthier options . i ordered the avocado and eggs and loved not having to feel guilty about what i ate ! also , great craft beer and cider selection and great music . definitely give their brunch a try !
american	the decor , for me , not appealing , but the food turned out to be really good . i ordered the catch of the day fish sandwich . one of the best fish sandwiches i 've had . a friend of mine had the fish tacos and loved them . there was a party of six of us and we all really enjoyed the food . perfect stop for lunch in vegas . the services was very good as well .
american	i didn 't want to gorge out on a heavy meal so i just ordered the pulled pork sliders ( appetizer ) & a sweet tea . the pulled pork came out on 3 hawaiian rolls w / cole slaw which was absolutely delicious & the perfect size , just enough to fill me up but not too much to make me feel super stuffed . server was friendly & provided excellent service ! we went on a saturday night around 6pm & there was no wait which was a bonus . the sliders & sweet tea came out to $ 15.09 . i 'll be back to give their bbq a try next time !
american	we shared everything - fried green tomato blt , deviled eggs , chicken salad , fried chicken n ' watermelon n ' waffles . everything was really good . it was so good that gordon ramsay was sitting right behind me .
american	this was my second visit and i am loving this new location . the layout is so bright and airy , the food was piping hot , flavorful and creative and our server / waiter chris was perfect . great sense of humor , extremely courteous and helpful with the menu and fast and efficient . we waited for nothing because he had everything taken care of . i had the huevo 's rancheros skillet and received a huge serving ! i 'll be coming back to dine here again !
american	we happened upon this restaurant . we were pleasantly surprised . the gnocchi i had was well prepared and flavorful . two of my friends got the special with tilapia fish . it looked beautifully presented and they both said it was fantastic . my other friend had scallops and loved them too . we were so happy with our meals we had dessert too . my hazelnut chocolate mousse and my friend 's pistachio gelato were very good . if you live in cleveland or are traveling there for work , very nice place to eat . good service . nice ambiance . loved the full wall picture of the florence skyline . : - ) thanks for a lovely meal .
american	the food & service was great ! i think we scared our poor server ( mike ) , but he was wonderful !
american	so many times , it ends badly . ( i 'm sure it 's hard to wait on 25 people all at once . ) . well , kimber at the black bear diner is a rock star ! her jokes may have made me groan , but she got all our orders right and the kitchen kept them rolling out . usually the worst part is getting the checks , and she did that part well , too . i had the hamburger steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables , and i saw other people 's chicken fried steak , pot roast , and fish n chips . everything was delicious and the service was the very best we have had ! thanks , kimber .
american	we wanted the happy hour but the happy hour is only outside in the patio and there wasn 't enough seats for 11 of us and the tables were first come first serve . i was happy we sat inside as it seemed it was too loud sitting outside . the food was good and the waiter was very attentive . there are lots of choices and the prices are reasonable with large portions .
american	nothing beats a plate of belgian waffles with strawberries and whipped cream before an important midterm ! the coffee kept coming with our chatting and it was a great wake-up before studying that day . the staff were friendly and everyone keeps telling me i need to go back and have one of their milkshakes or malts , so looks like i 'll be doing that ! it would be nice if parking wasn 't always an ordeal or expensive in this area though .
american	the portions are huge , especially the desserts , the service was exceptional and you can even purchase a shirt to remind you of your experience at the horny toad . horny toad addressed some of our dietary restrictions without any hassles , which was very appreciative . i recommend the horny toad for a casual outing if your in the area .
american	we made a pretty good choice . the service was fast , efficient , friendly . the menu was extensive and well priced . one day , when i 've given up on life , i plan to go back and order the oreo cookie pancakes . they look amazing . they also look like they 'll probably kill me .
american	the breakfast and sandwich menu items are home style cooked , full of flavour and exactly the right size . if you like breakfast items , try the parma hash or the multigrain pancakes . probably the best pancakes i 've tasted anywhere ! staff are friendly , helpful and courteous . we ended up going there on a bi-weekly basis it was that good .
american	i had some of the baba ganoush , a spicy beef pita and sauteed red potatoes . the baba ganoush was okay . the spicy beef pita was kinda of like a burrito ... it 's not really on the menu . the item on the menu was the spicy chicken pita so i asked them to substitute it for beef and they complied . my friend ordered a side of the red potatoes and that was tasty and well seasoned . pita jungle was a mediterranean fast food ... so for what it is . it 's great !
american	the place was very busy and noisy but our waitress was exceptional and we were treated very good . we had appetizers that were great and were brought out quickly . we will be going back .
american	i had the chicken wrap and french fries , the fries were hot and delicious , the wrap was loaded with chicken and avocado , it was good ! 2 of our group had the burger , it was huge and reportedly tasted good too . overall , the only complaint was the iced tea was weak , but the server brought replacement drinks immediately . i 'd go back !
american	i don 't see it on the menu anymore , but the chicken and waffles were the best i 've had yet !
american	great staff / service , great ambiance , great food ! my husband got the short ribs with yukon puree and i got the trout . so delicious with a great wine selection . would definitely return .
american	parking is really bad . we were told a 20 minute wait for a party of 8 and that was pretty much spot on . judging by the crowd outside i was surprised it was not longer . service was pretty quick except for one breakfast . i had a grilled cheese with tomato and bacon with a side salad . the food is basic diner fare done right but nothing that will wow you . i would say 3-1 / 2 stars but rounded up in this case . if i was in the area i would not hesitate to go here again .
american	the food was great ! i also had a bloody mary , it was really good . it 's nice that the bar is separate from the dining area . my only complaint is that it was very dark at the salad bar . it was hard to see what i was grabbing . our waiter was great . very friendly and funny . we will be back .
american	we sampled several things on the menu . i got the queen bee burger .... beelicious ! ! ! ! ! . another friend had one of the salads filled with quality ingredients & wow the homemade soups , great on these cold days . we would recommend sweet buzz to anyone . prices were fair for the amount you get i will definitely go back .
american	waitress was very friendly and helpful . i had the iph which i really enjoyed and was priced fair . to eat i had a burger with bacon and carmelized onions on it . burger was very tasty as well . someone in our party had the mac n cheese which looked like it should have been family style portion size . i didn 't think the place was that loud as other reviewers spoke of . overall based on the quality of the beer / food , and great waitstaff i would definitely return . keep up the good work .
american	my hubby got the lobster grilled cheese and raved ! our service was exceptional . definitely will go back even if we aren 't boating .
american	service was fantastic and food was amazing with things you don 't always see on the brunch scene ( oxtail benedict and spiced rum french toast ) . definitely recommend for anyone in toronto ... even if you 're not staying nearby !
american	i sampled stromboli , deep dish pizza , and chicken tenders . the stromboli is deserving of its stellar reputation - it certainly stood out as a fantastic dish ! the deep dish pizza and chicken tenders were also very good . the food is definitely 5-star , but the ambience is only 3-star , so i give it a total of 4 stars .
american	prior to leaving for the gc we wanted to get a good breakfast . bragg 's factory diner exceeded our expectations . i had the early birdrito .... so yummy . we also split several of the baked goods ... delicious . this is a fun , funky place with lots to look at . it 's run by a great couple and wonderful baker . getting to know them made the experience that much better . if i lived in phoenix i would be a regular for sure .
american	i wish we had gone there earlier in the week . they have a fantastic happy hour menu with full portions at happy hour prices . the staff was very friendly and fun . the entire atmosphere was just great . definitely a place to hit while you 're in town .
american	there were six of us and he took such good care of us . we were in town to attend the funeral of my mother . thanks so much for being so kind to us . the food was super good too ! large portions and very tasty . thanks a bunch and keep up the good work guys .
american	the 4 of us all ordered individual dishes and then ended up sharing most of what was on the table . i ordered the rice & bean veggie burger ( decent , maybe kind of underwhelming - but came with a really good side salad . ) other dishes on the table were : the fried brussels sprouts ( delicious ) , a caesar salad ( very tasty - i enjoyed the added capers ) , some chicken wings ( didn 't try any ) and veggie ght slinger ( didn 't try any either . ) i loved the vibe of the place and would love to come back for dinner .
american	we had a great experience . hubby had the pastrami ( loved it ) and i had the bbq chicken salad ; both were excellent . they were warm , fully-cooked , unlike some of the negative reviews on here about this restaurant . we experienced only positives from dining here . it was a sunday lunch crowd , getting pretty busy , yet our service never suffered . we sat in the bar area , so the bartender had both bar clients and high-tops and never missed a beat . we will definitely be back ! !
american	my coupon was honoured gracefully without another complication and i had great professional services . we tried : appetizer : - arugula salad soup : - fish chowder - mushroom puree main : - rainbow trout - steak frites ( $ 7 additional to upgrade to tenderloin ) dessert : - wild ontario berry frangiapane - popcorn panna cotta anything were nicely presented and delicious ! the portion size is their standard offers and quite a good value when i get to use my coupon ! love the courtyard seating when the weather is nice ..... i definitely recommend earth rosedale if you looking for a quiet and laid back restaurant for brunch or dinner !
american	it was a very long wait but decided to stick it out . the inside is a bit small but in the winter the outside patio will be used for sure . the seating also included the bar area and i am picky about that . for just hanging out that is wonderful but for a romantic dinner it could be a bit crowded and uncomfortable . there isn 't many options in that regard because of the limited space . the food was really good . i had the ribs & chicken on two different occasions . i can 't remember if it is on wednesday or thursday nights but they have a special for coupled up folks that is a good price .
american	the service was superb from the welcome to the farewell . loved the proseco on draft ! ! ! the menu was varied enough to satisfy all of us , each with a different palette . even the deserts were fun . nice addition to the area-- i would visit again .
american	just arrived to town and needed a quick bite before our meeting started . great service . checked on us mutliple times . wait time for food was decent . has the south west salad . clean facility .
american	the fries have changed from the past in that they have a different texture because of different oil ( trans fat free ) but are still good , especially with salt and vinegar . the thing i miss is the " grapette " drink from when i was a teenager . now it 's just soft drinks . probably shouldn 't eat this food that often for health reasons but it 's still tasty ...
american	the pickle chips and parmesan fries are delicious ! i would be happy to just eat those . i had the panini with veggie balls , gouda cheese and pesto . so good ! my only complaint is that the pesto is too creamy . i wish they would go back to the original pesto . we have always had great service here .
american	the food is very good , mostly healthy food . love their salad . the waitress was very nice and helpful . friendly atmosphere and good food .
american	" okay i didn 't say that , but the first part was real , and i love raising cane 's .
american	i was fortunate enough to stop here last night and pick up a mixed meat platter . wow ! the food was so fresh , and hot . it was the most amazing food i have had in months . this will be a new frequent stop for me and my son . " q " was the most helpful and friendly guy ever . he helped me choose what i should order and stayed diligent throughout . a + ... if you don 't try this place , you are only doing yourself a huge dis-service. oh ! almost forgot ! ! the hummus ! ! ! dear lord , go eat all the hummus ! ! ! ! -zak
american	it was filling , tasty , and quick ! my friend and i biked to south side for the sole purpose of obtaining a gyro . under her recommendation we went here and let me tell you - it was worth the life risking bike ride . the bike ride isn 't bad , i 'm just a horrible biker , so getting here is actually quite easy . we ordered our gyros , went to wash our sweaty hands and came down to sit to our freshly made gyros . i love , love the gyro bread , the fluffy goodness that cushions your jaw with every bite . i would advise everyone to get this . everyone .
american	snooze kierland knows what they 're doing . mmmmmimosa , 2 breakfast tacos with strip bacon , and a pineapple upside down pancake for the table please . i love that you can customize their menu . hungry ? order the pancake sampler , toss back a few more mmmmmimosas , and thank me later . fun music . great environment . bring the fam .
american	had a large party for dinner and the staff was so accommodating . we had 15 people and they sat us immediately . one of the party members was even gluten free and the waitress brought out a separate menu with several options . love it ! don 't forget to to order a pizookie - the best in town !
american	the sweetbreads rocked it and the service was great . the menu is very interesting . a friend loved the beet and watermelon salad .
american	monte cristo a delight . quirk , fun , and long wait .
american	w and i split the chinese chicken salad and a delux burger . the salad was so huge and they already split it into 2 bowls i had to make sure that it was just one order , not 2 . the fries came out first , then the salad , then the burger . the fries should have come out with the burger because by the time the burger came out , we almost finished the fries . the service was kind of slow . i don 't know if the waiter was sluggish from thanksgiving turkey or what , but he was not very quick to clear the table at all .
american	the name of this gastronomic delight ? the cardiologist . definitely on my list of top five burgers ever .
american	located in a little shopping market plaza next to a nitro ice cream shop lou malnati 's has found its arizona home . the service here is top notch , the nicest servers and hosts . the red sauce pizza with sausage deep dish was their signature and so filling i don 't know why we ordered a second pizza , which was a thin crust with our choice of veggies mine were mushrooms , my friend got jalapeños .
american	only downside is it is always super busy with long waits and the parking lot is tiny-especially on weekends . word of advice-call ahead !
american	it was as good as i thought it would be . when you go , and i know you will , you must have the parmesan potato poppers . i could not believe something so crisp on the outside could be so light and fluffy on the inside . the meat loaf was great almost as good as the sweet potato bisque . a wonderful cool little joint .
american	the chicken wings appetizer with the oatmeal stout infused barbeque sauce is scrumptious .
american	had brunch on a saturday and completely loved it . i 'm not a vegetarian and enjoyed it . muffins and jam were delightful . drinks were excellent and most of all the food was yummy . leftovers the next day made we want to return soon .
american	from 5pm-7pm , all drinks are 1 / 2 price and slider plates are $ 2 off ! we ordered the garlic sliders w / roasted red pepper , greens , and lemon mayo ( lemon mayo ? ! so good ! ) and the sweet bbq sliders w / bacon , cheddar , and grilled onion . we were pretty blown away by the flavor and juiciness of the burgers ! and our total bill was $ 20 . for two full meals and 2 craft beers , you really can 't beat that !
american	as far as i 'm concerned it 's the best italian beef sandwich in az . i always get it dipped with hot peppers and i 'm a happy girl . their combo with beef and sausage is also great . they serve chicago hot dogs the way i remember back home . even their cheese sauce for the fries tastes like cheese and not the regular canned toxic cheese . yes , the place is loud , yes the place gets crowded . but i don 't care - it 's a happy reminder of home for me . can 't wait until they open their tempe marketplace location closer to where i live !
american	anya , kimmi , and shaina are the best ! ! ! ! once again superb service ! i don 't know what emily p. was smoking but she needs to go somewhere else if she 's that uptight about the bartenders talking to other patrons . anya , kimmi , and shaina are the reasons why people love returning to nd . ladies keep doing what you 're doing !
american	only open a week , place is huge inside and a nice patio but people were still waiting to eat brunch today ! got chicken and waffles , honey got frittata and thick bacon , coffee the best ! coming back sunday with a bunch of couples for bloody marys ! can 't wait !
american	; - ) ok , well , it 's still in my mind. best buffet ever ! i liked : all you can eat rack of lamb ! chilean sea bass was excellent too ! these are restaurant-entry quality. also got to try : venison , beef wellington , and beef tartar. many others were good -- too many ! didn 't even try the prime rib - too common and too many other interesting things to try ! desserts : i like the bananas foster , apricot mousse , tiramisu in it 's own chocolate cup. line : i asked and they said 1 / 2 hour. we got in in 15 min .
american	it has the greasy-spoon vibe down to a t , and as far as i can tell this is the only place for miles around where you can get a big plate of eggs and bacon , toast and coffee for under $ 10 . if your brunch tastes run to " give me a plate of eggs " rather than " benedict and mimosa " this is your stop .
american	sweet potato fries had a sweet flavor ? they were the bomb ! yum ! the atmosphere was lively and fun with the noise level of a typical sports bar . they had two large christmas parties going and we still had excellent service . drinks were kept full . we will definitely go back the next time we are in town !
american	it 's a laid-back atmosphere in a strip mall area right near my house . i do like the decor . it kind of makes me feel i am somewhat at a beach . i usually run into robin as my server . she 's a nice young girl who is quick with recommendations if i 'm not sure what i really want to eat . so far i 've had the monterey chicken sandwich , the frisco burger , teriyaki burger , and quite a few other sandwiches on the menu . i don 't think i had a meal that i did not enjoy there . the prices are very affordable .
american	having lived in garland , tx as a kid , i linger for good bbq . and lucille 's has just that . their baby back ribs are superb . i have a weak spot for their bbq brisket sandwiches ( topped with their original bbq sauce ! ) . oh , and their pulled pork sandwich is something special . i love their baked beans . the service is usually impeccable ( avoid weekends , though , and you won 't worry about wait times ) .
american	pizza is amazing , salads are to die for and dessert is heavenly ! love the friendly and chill enviorment ! have never ordered anything i did not like !
american	things could be worse . slymans gives you an overwhelming amount of excellent corned beef and i thought my breakfast plate of corned beef , a scrambled egg , hashbrowns , and rye was really excellent . the star is obviously the beef , but the crisp edges on the hashbrowns are exemplary . if only the actual browns controlled the edges as well ( i think that makes sense ) . go dubs .
american	got right in and sat at a 2-top pub table in the bar area . finally took the plunge an ordered the shrimp and grits . amazing ! best breakfast ever ! service was over the top as well . never less than 1 / 2 full on coffee and the nicest waiter ! will definitely be back !
american	ahead of our trip to las vegas i did a lot of work figuring out where to eat.mon ami gabi was recommended highly.it did not disappoint.from its ambiance to our service and most of the amazing food everyone had a wonderful experience .
american	i love how you can customize every part of your order - the lettuce , toppings , dressing , even down to the bite size and most of all that you don 't have to weigh it by the end . i could honestly eat here everyday and never get tired of it . every time i go , they have new salad bar additions - kale / spinach mix , wheat berries , asparagus , etc - that shows the owners really like to keep innovative . i 'm sure if this were in a more health conscious city ( that doesn 't put fries on everything ) this place would be booming , similar to sweet green . but they will always have my loyalty !
american	the atmosphere is spacious and amazing ... lots of seating for groups , that include ample space for working . it is also good for dining alone or a date night . it was my first visit ; but certainly will not be my last .... as there are so many possibilities to try . today , i ordered the buttermilk chicken it was a combination of deliciousness ! i enjoyed and savored every bite . you will not regret the dining experience at this place , try it for yourself !
american	i had a very tasty falafel wrap for lunch . it was served on a whole wheat wrap with tomatoes , taboule , hot sauce and another hummus-like sauce . really very good . and only $ 4.99 - probably the cheapest food court lunch i 've had in a long time . for $ 7.99 you can also have a salad and a pop . genius .
american	they have some great salads because the greens are nice and crisp . the premade salads are fairly better than average . i like making my own . the corn bread and other bakeries are the " bomb-diggity " meaning it 's very good . the soups weren 't too great the last time i went . a bit too salty . the only other gripe i have is that the last time i went , it wasn 't busy at all , but they didn 't take away the plates on our table until we were nearly finished eating there , but usually they 're good about it .
american	salad with four toppings was decent and filling and i left thinking that i had made a good choice . one thing about this food court is the scenery . lots of people very well dressed ( or not well dressed , depending on how you look at it ) and way too many teenagers primped for their friends . was i ever like that ? don 't answer that question .
american	the staff were friendly , fun and very helpful my 1st time in when i was trying to decide what to get . they have a ton of options if you have dietary restrictions .. if you like spicy ... try the spicy kale & chicken soup ! very good . the do sell wine and beer , with a few local craft beers in tap it reminds me alot of the laughing planet cafe in the pacific northwest . a great lunch spot , near the district area .
american	nice . had the " small " pork plate ( pulled pork ) collard greens and mac n cheese . all good , although my personal preference is for more smoke on the pork . carolina style vinegar sauce was good . service was friendly .
american	this place delivers a wonderful and huge serving of portuguese chicken over fresh cheese curds and fries . there was so much flavor in their sauce , whatever it is , that i couldn 't stop eating even after i was full . went into food coma and had to take a nap dreaming about eating more of this . definitely the best poutine in montreal .
american	fantastic craft beer on tap , a great crew of people behind the bar , and fair prices ! i only wish this were closer to my home !
american	lobster me is a true gem tucked away amongst the shops of the venetian--a must try when in vegas ! the steep prices here ( given that it 's a food court-style place ) is the only downside , but trust me , you 'll be happy you paid the $ 17 for your roll ! would recommend : 1 . connecticut lobster roll ( the only warm sandwich on the menu ) which is stuffed with a generous serving of delicious lobster on a soft , buttery bun . 2 . lobster mac and cheese 3 . cajun fries
american	scallops are wonderful ( my favorite ) .got the bread pudding last night , and finished it off for breakfast this morning . always outstanding service and a nice atmosphere . highly recommended
american	a very nice place with lots of potential . not busy when i was there for mid-week dinner . family run it seems . i hesitate to give this 4 stars because i kind of felt that the entree was just not ' great ' . good simple food but the jus tasted canned and the frites were okay only . service was great . would go back again . maybe not tomorrow though .
american	i 've been a fan of gyros all my life , and this place is one of the best . the meat is sooooooooo good .... i sometimes get a double meat and then add extra meat onto it ( yes , yes my friends , you can do it , do it online , on the phone they sometimes get confused ) , and the jojos are a piece of edible art . if you like meat , if you like it in copious quantities , go here my friends . they also have pizza and beer , but every time i go in i get so distracted by tasty gyro i forget i wanted to try them .
american	so reliable for the late night poutine , especially gratiné style where they take your poutine and put it in the oven and make the cheese all crispy and gooey and magique . this place has been in the same greek family for 3 + generations , and they serve up a big menu of quebecois fast food diner eats with speed and a sense of humour . brown wooden booths , windows on mount royal and st denis , a limited bar with just enough options to do you damage . the star burger comes with an onion ring and curd cheese and might give you a heart attack , but at least you 'll die happy .
american	fn . mazing . best steak i have ever had . i 'm so full and happy , i cannot finish this review . very expensive but worth every cent .
american	open 24 hours , and the food 's still as greasy , still as good as it used to be . great shakes too . they now have a special white chocolate shake and an egg nog shake for the holidays . oh so tasty . i do miss the steak n shake in st. louis though . there 's nothing quite like being served by a surly 40ish woman named puddin ' at midnight when you 're hungry and also craving a shake .
american	the service is really great and the food is always good . this is a much better choice over denny 's because they are cheap and the food portions are better than denny 's . good place to wander over to after coming out of shirt 's ' n ' things . i recommend the pie . it 's free on wednesdays
american	what can i say ? i love me some eggs ! i saw that they had " breakfast fries " on the menu and decided to try it . took a while for them to bring it out . huge helping of fries topped with eggs , canadian bacon , sausage , and cheese . a dash of hot sauce makes it even better . good breakfast option . we were staying at the mgm and just weren 't willing to eat at a $ $ breakfas place for our last day so we crossed the bridge and found this place . it 's located at the south beach marketplace .
american	it seems like everytime i eat here i am either leaving or arriving lv . this particular time ( 9 / 8 ) , i happened to be leaving . and once again , i find comfort in the welcoming service and delicious burgers . the place consistently provides above average , friendly service and great food . seriously , if you are on your way to or from the airport , this is the place to stop .
american	the raging debate goes on as to which is better . well duh , they are different ! ! they both have fantastic things to offer . fatburger is fantastic , because a. they cook your food when you order it , b. you can get a fried egg on top of your burger , and c. you can fax in your order . fatburger tastes so great and you get your choice of skinny fries , fat fries , or onion rings . also , you can get a turkey burger which is so good ! ! i crave fatburger once in a while and i absolutely cannot satisfy the craving otherwise .
american	a nice treat before the plane ride home . as you can imagine , its pretty crowded . parking was easier on the company store side . excellent burger and fries just like every other in n out i have been to .
american	many , many a college wednesday night spent at this place for 5 $ pitchers followed by a cookout trip and the inevitable skipping of that 8am class . beautiful scenery , great patio , next to paddle boats , and food is pretty decent . how can you not like a place where one of the menu options includes a giant burger , 6 wings , and a generous helping of fries ! ? ! ? and the loaded cheese fries are some of the best i have ever had for sure .
american	over easy is way cool , and by all accounts it 's matt 's big breakfast 's latest challenger for best breakfast in town . and the winner ... over easy by a nose . i 've been twice now , and both times i 've had the waffle and hash browns . unfortunately the maple syrup is nowhere near as good as matt 's or palette ( the best syrup in town ) but still pretty good . but what really makes this place better than matt 's is that they really do care about you while you wait ( what a concept ) . so yes , there are outside seats for people waiting and that 's a big deal to me .
american	ahhh ember grille ... brings back fond memories - 2 poached eggs with whole wheat toast to go - breakfast buffets - shrimp caeser salad , dressing on the side - salmon dinners indeed i spent many a meal here ...
american	the atmosphere is fantastic - cozy and not pretentious , the food and drinks are good and not expensive . their patio is a go-to spot during the spring / summer for drinks and to watch sports. ugh i love this place . i always order the cajun fries and chicken fingers . will be a customer here for life .
american	its all the same ! well here the food isnt super greasy ! ! i love the grilled chicken options they have as well as their breakfast sandwich , but i get it without ham ! the price is ok , you pay for what you get right ? i also like their curly fries ! one weird thing is that they do not give a toy with the kids meals ! left my son hangin ! anway i come here when im in this area .
american	i am a fan of their eggs benedict ( without the ham ) and roasted potatoes , very good . the staff is friendly and helpful and the food is delicious and tastes just like home made cookin ' ! just forget about going there on sat or sun morning unless you enjoy waiting and waiting and waiting some more . i suggest going on a weekday , you get seated right away . great place to take the family for breakfast .
american	what is there not to love about qt ? they let you mix soft drinks and have sooo many good options for beverages . their food isn 't awful ( actually pretty good for convenience store food ) and the people are typically fairly friendly . though it 's a chain , i think this is a pretty good qt .
american	( 117 degrees ) we sat in the other dining room , where it was a lot quieter . the spare ribs were really flavorful and tender . the meatloaf and potatoes were pretty amazing . i really enjoyed the corn nuggets . the mac and cheese was just ok , although the lady behind me raved about it three times .
american	this is the only location in vegas ! i am glad they have one from where i from ( st louis ) they have them everywhere ! i have read some of the reviews and i must laugh at some , this place is not a five star burger place , they are called " belly bombers " for a reason ! they a quick snack food and great late late at night or early am , or beating a rough night before . i love white castles and will continue to go back they are great and i am glad to have them in town ! ! !
american	i love their sweet tea , with lemon ! its a deal for only 1 dollar for a large ! ! also , their play place is pretty rad ! my son likes it anyway ... i like it when the mosters actually have socks on ! i also like the hazelnut iced coffee and love the fries !
american	hilarious theme and great sandwiches . what more can you ask for ? ! some may not appreciate the decor ( ahem ... ) but you 'll still appreciate the food ! my personal favorite is the ak 47 which is basically a french dip with mushrooms and onions ( and whatever else you want on it including parmesan and oregano ) . my boyfriend has tried both the thai stick ( teriyaki chicken ) and the bbq chicken ( i forget the witty name of it ) and a friend of mine loves the midwests best ( an italian club of sorts ) . the line can sometimes e long but all in all it 's a pretty sweet spot to grab a sandwich !
american	i work at a surgery center nearby , and they are always ordering jimmy johns or firehouse subs for us . and i 'm sick of those measly little things . finally we found a place with sandwiches for men . sandwich spot hits all the right spots -- great bread , thick slabs of meat , melted cheese , pickles and tomatoes , etc . i don 't give away five stars easily , but this place deserves it .
american	not all processed . the fries were awesome , the sandwiches were very good and the service was friendly . try it you 'll like it ! ! !
american	let 's start with checking in for a free pretzel cookie or coffee . a must is the fried chicken with waffle ! ! ! ! ! ! the bread was perfect .. so fluffy , soft and moist . the chicken was also cooked perfectly with the batter , with a perfect sweetness added . bulgarian benedict was very interesting , good flavors ! my friend also had the huevos rancheros which i would recommend ordering something else since it was nothing special .
american	i love earl of sandwich ! ! i 'm so happy that it 's 24 / 7 ! ! = ) their italian sandwich is super delish ! the price isn 't so bad either ! i recommend coming here if you 're looking for a cheap convenient filling place to eat at vegas !
american	headed to the fams for easter and thought hmmmm a sandwich sounds good . thanks to yelp we found ike 's ! ! ! ! their signature bread is so delicious as is their special sauce . tried a roast beef salami one and the deep fried chicken with their bbq honey sauce . please start one in washington . also the workers were so happy and helpful ! can 't wait to come back to mesa !
american	best bbq i 've ever had ! sat at the bar ... friendly crowd , great service and trust your waiters / waitresses ! ! they were able to make the perfect recommendations ! ! ! i will be back !
american	chopped salad , truffle grilled cheese and scallops were all delish ! prices were very reasonable . service was excellent . vibe was good . 5 stars !
american	my first time here and it was so delish . their homemade potato chips were so crunchy and flavorful . the haystack onion appetizer was big enough to keep a large party busy until the main course arrives . i will definitely be back here , customer service was top notch as well . gotta love walking into a bbq place and being greeted with friendly staff and the carnivorous smell of slow cooking barbecue .
american	super cute place ! great food ! downtown phx vibes but on the west side !
american	the portions are huge & prices a bit steep , but the food is delicious ! ! ! we shared the tower o ' chicken and waffles , the crab cakes and a pot roast hash . everything was to die for . we also had a round of mimosas that were put in a to go cup so we could enjoy them on the walk back to our hotel - gotta love vegas ! definitely make this a must stop on your next trip , you won 't be disappointed !
american	we walked 20 minutes in the freezing cold to try this place . it was well worth it . i got the smoked meat sandwich with a pickle , fries , and a cherry coke . definitely hit the spot . we even bought some meat to take back to california . the staff was very friendly and welcoming ! we loved it !
american	i 'm a huge fan of the eat local food trend . deagans is up there on the list of using locally sourced meats , produce , and cheese which makes my belly say " more deagans please . " ok , my mouth says " more deagans please " and my belly says " feed me more deagans . " i work in lakewood and frequent the bar on a regular basis for lunch and a beer ..... or two .
american	my burger was perfection . brisket was crazy good along with the beef ribs ! staff was fun and super friendly . in love with the decor ! ! !
american	so glad we found this little piece of sandwich heaven ! and it 's right here in our backyard !
american	i had the mexi-burger and it was probably the single best burger i have ever had . perfectly juicy and crisp . the fries were also very good. and oh my the soda selection . i did the math and there is about 500 different sodas . a must go in my opinion .
american	my order has not changed in the 6 years i have been going there . two reg dogs , one with chili mustard , and onions the other with hot sauce , mustard , and onions. an order of onion rings and a chocolate shake round it all out . it tastes the same every time ( delicious ) and you can 't beat the price or ambiance . i love when you 're sandwiched between a couple in their 70 's and a family with small kids , everyone just enjoying americana . ted 's does it right , enjoy !
american	the food was sooo amazing ! ! ! ! our experience was perfect ! ! ! ! ! thank youuuuuu bacchanal buffet for everything ! !
american	this place is soooo amazing ! i wish i lived in vegas ! the concept of the whole place is so neat ! i had the chicken waffle and omg it was sooooo good ! the red valvet pancakes were amazing as well . i love how the servers were in their pajamas and sleeping slippers . this place is a must if you 're in town . it 's going to be my stop whenever i 'm in the neighborhood ! yummy yummy !
american	word of mouth took me to this wonderful establishment at the corner of bloor and crawford ( just west of christie pits park and a step from my door ) and it lived up to it 's reputation . you can take my word-of-mouth to heart ; delicious and well priced dishes , including both meat and veggie delights ! recently , a south indian cuisine restaurant opened right next door called madras masala , inevitably by the owners of banjara and i can not wait to try it next ! look for the madras review coming soon !
american	the soul food here is to die for--definitely the best in the valley . if you 've never been to lo-lo 's you 're missing out . period . overall , the wait is worth the fried gold at the end of the rainbow .
american	ordered the oxtail chilly cheese fries. mind blown . y 'all must try !
american	i 'm not even really a bbq fan as i think most bbq restaurants overcook the meat and smother with bbq sauce . totally not the case here . had the brisket and it was incredible . we completely scarfed it down in minutes ... i will definitely be back here very soon !
american	went for brunch last sunday , service was great and food was even better . i had the breakfast burrito and loved every bite of it ! did i mention the cinnamon sticky buns ? ! ? ! sooooo good ! my sister had a delicious mimosa and some steak and eggs benedict dish and cleared her plate as well ! she has been before for dinner and said it was great . they serve cinnamon buns at dinner too folks ! its a fancy country club feeling kind of place but staff was very friendly . i will definitely come back .
american	ahhh , honey bear 's. i 'm not sure where the name comes from , but i am sure the food is darn good. the meat is ridiculously tender. the sauce is good , runny , but good. somehow i end up consuming a couple tubs of it without realizing. the proportions aren 't very big , for the sandwiches or the sides , but i guess you can argue that it helps you to not over-eat. prices are pretty fair though. and again , the taste ... mmm ... they cater too , which is pretty amazing when you show up somewhere and it 's buffet honey bear 's time !
american	i eat here at least once a week . the mediterranean chicken salad and the hummus and chicken are my two staples .
american	why not a nice breakfast , eh ? the fantastic coffee is served with fresh cream . the benedict was the best i had ever had . the fruit is fresh and the pancakes fluffy . modestly priced from items off the menu , and the buffet they offer for those on the run was about 15 dollars . it included breakfast meats , fruit , hash , even an omelette station . we sat out on the terrace .... well , inside the casino , but outside the restaurant , it was nice , romantic .
american	i have tried many of the specialty dishes here but the one i always go back to is the crazy alfredo . my second choice is always the smokehouse . my wife and daughter love the one with the hot dogs mixed in , can 't remember what its called because i won 't eat it ! haha check this place out when you 're in the mood for pasta fast .
american	where do i begin ... this restaurant is a little slice of heaven . the melting pot is great for a girls get together and anything in between . the cheese and chocolate fondues are my favorite .
american	while i hadn 't been here in at least 5 years ...... not a thing has changed . and thankfully so . old school charm and service . great food , great service , great drinks . nice .
american	the food was good , but i think the staff made it even better . the salad preparation at the table was a nice twist . then to have " bananas foster " made for us at the table ... wow ! and did i mention that a rose is given to each of the ladies that dine there ? that made for an extra special touch i thought . tip : be sure to ask for parking validation and they are more than happy to assist .
american	i didn 't care much for the adobo omelet ( it seemed dry and salty to me ) so i had the waitress box it up hoping someone at home would like it . well , i was right , my husband , the human garbage disposal , loved it ! !
american	i wish i could eat here more often without gaining an extra hamburger ( or 3 ) weight . so glad they 've taken credit cards , as before it was cash only . i usually only get the hamburgers , which are pretty darn good . the place is the size of my thumb , but that doesn 't take away from how good and " dinerish " the food is . the milkshakes , fries and onion rings are delish . the staff reminds me of diners back home- a strange assortment that works ! and the best part ? the prices ! a lot of food for a super deal of a price .
american	my boyfriend and i would come here all the time for the expresso crusted filet and flowerless chocolate cake , we even came here on new years one year and had a fabulous time . during my recent phoenix visit i had to pop in for dinner with my bestie for the stetson chop salad with salmon and although it had been forever it did not dissapoint . literally the most amazing concoction ever . its so fresh and flavorful i could eat it everyday ! the place was just as i remembered romantic and casual with good wine and delicious food .
american	then i ate it and it was good . just as suspected . i gotta always have the garlic potatoes with my order . and don 't forget the extra pitas !
american	i 'm in love ... like the real thing this time . oh ya , i got it bad for this mystic muffin ! ( hmm ... questionable phrase ) i 'll keep it short since the 5 stars says it all : 1 ) applee caaaaake ! 2 ) don 't even read the menu , just let elias take care of you - and that he shall ! 3 ) sandwich , soup / salad / whatever , dessert , drink under $ 10 ( cash ) healthy , unique flavours , and service to boot !
american	i 've gone once when i was a kid and now i go again as an adult , and i love it . the sandwiches are stuffed and they don 't skimp out on anything . i had the vermonter which was great . the potato salad and tuna salad was amazing as well . service was prompt and friendly . the only downside to martone 's is that it 's a bit pricey for a sandwich .... $ 8- $ 10 . i couldn 't eat here everyday on my food budget .
american	my 2 kids and i headed over from our hotel by lake las vegas . the atmosphere is casual , a good menu , reasonable prices . we tried a little of everything . the pork was incredible and the sides were real down south style and great flavor . six thumbs up from us ! !
american	my husband and i were in the mood for something new , as we browsed uber eats and decided on jessie rae 's . the food was nothing short of perfection . the meat had such depths of flavor . we have eaten bbq all over the country and this is the best we 've had . texas and st. louis , some of the giants barbecue culinary giants have been underwhelming compared to what we experienced tonight . thankful this place is in vegas !
american	we had a wonderful time eating a late dinner . the rock shrimp app was amazing , & the bread was delish ! we had the short ribs ( which were perfect and tender ) love the flavours . i had the filet mignon which and impeccable as well , perfectly cooked med rare . we saved a bit of room for dessert as well ! i had the pana cotta , it was awesome . my first time trying the dish , i loved the balsamic and basil additions it was incredible . my mother had the pot de creme and she love that as well ! overall a amazing dining experience due to our great waitress and the always wonderful chef matt .
american	fresh clean open airy feel- knew we came to the right place for post-workout fuel . wellness is abundant here . loved the kale salad w / salmon , the greek yogurt parfait with huge berries , and our very own flask of hibiscus green tea . sweet and friendly servers . will be back for the bar treats and more mama-daughter time ! affection-food-community
american	my favorite place ! we go to olive and gourmando for breakfast almost every day , and it 's totally worth the wait , this is there sister restaurant for dinner ! and it 's just fabulous ! ! ! ! : ) the decor , the food , the service , the ambiance ! the people ... it 's great ! ! !
american	this is the perfect sub spot to satisfy those lovely munchies . vegetarian lovas will enjoy the majic mushroom sandwich on a blunt size garlic herb bread .
american	the aroma in the air from the smoking of bbq will draw you in quickly ! the eastern style bbq , ribs , turkey and smoked wings are all good . the baked beans and mac n cheese are tasty . don 't forget the cheese muffins ! the restaurant is very clean and nicely designed to accommodate families . great customer service !
american	usually i stop in for a tasty beverage ( and free popcorn ) - the place never disappoints in that realm . the cozy atmosphere , great service and the occasional treat of live music all tickle my fancy . but sometimes , yes sometimes , i go there for the food . and when i do , i 'm always pleasantly surprised . last night 's dining selection was the french dip . so yummy . high quality meat , swiss that tastes like swiss and thick bread to soak up the au jus . the mushrooms and onions are just a bonus at that point . i 'll definitely be back !
american	i seriously love to go to five guys ( even though i only saw 3 guys and 1 girl ) . they are usually nice , cool , and make pretty awesome hotdogs and burgers . however i got one problem , they open at 11am , and i usually crave for burger in the morning since its more efficient of me to buy it early then go i work , other than that problemo , they make awesome foods !
american	came here with my parents , aunt , uncle and i for a late dinner and we were all satisfied with our choices . i chose the lasagna w / caesar salad and i love em ! love how they cook it in a dish straight in the oven so heats very well . been coming here with family since i was little and will continue to do so !
american	we drove to toronto from nyc and got in at about 2 : 30am . i was starving and didn 't feel like pizza , so decided to hit up this joint . it was saturday night and the hoards of drunken people were out but this place was pretty clean and didn 't have a lineup out the door , so i decided to get a burger , with two patties and a milkshake ( a pretty bad meal before bed but hey , i was on vacation ) . the burger was surprisingly really solid ! it seemed like it was freshly cooked and was delicious . the milkshake was solid too ! overall , great place to grab a late night snack !
american	i got the special combo something that came with three eggs , toast , two bacon strips , two sausages , two pea meal , one ham , three tomatoes and potatoes yum ! food : 4 / 5 , a perfect breakfast diner taste . nothing to complain here . service : 3 / 5 , normal service , diner style ambiance : 3 / 5 , very home-y , suburban feel where people of the neighbourhood gather on weekends to eat . price : 4 / 5 , very good at around $ 15 for all that food .
american	this place makes me so happy and helps reinforce my return to pittsburgh from the west coast . this is a great people watching spot and an even better place to buy any kind of seafood under the sun . great prices , nice staff , and amazing sushi by andy . yeah , it gets packed and there are a lot of elderly folks who can be very slooooow , but it is a nice example of local pittsburgh color . a must visit for any seafood enthusiast . i am lucky to work right up the street so i have lunch here at least once a week .
american	thai chicken wraps are so good ! ! our service every time is great , chris our server was attentive and on top of our drinks while we sat outside in the heat . that 's key ! ! cute food runner girl to stephine was so sweet made us feel at home ( : good ol cheese cake factory has yet to let me down .
american	hahaha . i would be walking to class and be smelling in n out in the air trying to tempt me to have that for my lunch / dinner . i 've learned to resist ( thankfully ) . anyway , don 't get me wrong it is awesome to have an in n out here right by unlv . it 's a great option when you don 't want any of the food offered in the student union . you can never go wrong with in in out . they are always consistent no matter how busy they can get , you can always count on great service and fresh yummy burgers & fries : - )
american	i love the coffee , i love the atmosphere , the only thing i don 't like is the wait . some times i wait 15-20 minutes , which is typically fine because i 'm sitting down to work , but some times i still wait when there 's no one there . all in all , the coffee is great , the staff is courteous and nice , and the atmosphere is relaxed .
american	another win for the lgo brand . the crispy chicken sammy was voted as a top chicken sandwich in az ... it did not disappoint . the fish sandwich was actually the winner of the day . the tartar sauce was out of this world . service was great , great patio , and some of the best restaurant music i have had in town ! this will defiantly be a go to in the arcadia area food meca .
american	" and it was pretty darn satisfying . the place is new with a northwest hunting lodge motif . 2 stories , with the second story having an open deck and awesome view of the strip . the food was actually decent , better than most chains and i had a huge chicken poblano sandwich for $ 10.95 . oh did i forget to mention the place is staffed by tiny , super friendly , half naked tree-nymphs ? seeing is believing . stay thirsty my friends .
american	perhaps with zucca chips , which i dream about ? ? just kidding ( well maybe .. they 're that good ) . everything here is amazing ; i have yet to see anyone order a bad dish . for dinner i usually get the salmon or spinach ravioli , yum . started coming for brunch on the weekends and absolutely love their egg dishes ( have had the sandwich , scramble , and frittata ) with the awesome crusty bread on the side . : ) probably my latest favorite is the jump start - chocolate milk shaken and served cold with 2 espresso shots ... so simple but so magical !
american	i used to go here every day for lunch . the eats ? shrimp tacos . several sandwiches named after california cities ( san marino = tuna = yum ) . smoothies . spinach eggs benedict . my favorites : the melt and the lobster melt . it 's a down to earth place with awesome staff . lisa is a ray of sunshine , and if you want a cheerful lunch , look no further .
american	when i 'm home visiting family everyone knows this is a must stop for me . i have never been disappointed by their food , drinks , service or ambiance . dining with a large party is always a challenge , but not here ! they go out of their way to accommodate and provide the appropriate number of wait staff . hats off to the kitchen because all 9 entrees were delicious . being a food and nutritionally aware diner i appreciate the calorie count and the lighter fare ... especially the ahi tuna tartare . thank you cheesecake factory for serving me another great evening !
american	who cannot love this iconic colorful back in time restaurant that is fun and open 24 / 7 ! i love the breakfast here ! the ham steak is the best i 've ever had . it is tender and tasty and is not overly salty . the portions are huge . my ham pretty much took up the plate ! they offer an extensive menu for breakfast , lunch ans dinner . the drinks look delicious and are huge . next time i must try their bloody mary .
american	i 've swapped out the usual pulled pork for some burnt ends , when i can get my hands on them ( early lunch ! ) .. brisket 's tasty too ( sliced and super tender ) . only one request : whip up this girl some mustard sauce !
american	i have to say i have been here numerous times as it is a good place for a consistent burger . the different bacons are my favorite thing , the foie burger is really too rich but good . the turkey burger is great just make sure if you get the waygu burger you get mid rare i have had a few over cooked burgers i unfortunately have sent back . the bar is a good place to sit also the fries with different dipping sauces are wonderful .
american	an oakland institution . hot dogs are the absolute best in town . this is a longtime busy city joint . not much has changed since coming here as a kid . night time it gets a little rowdy with drunks but daytime its a great place for one of the worlds best hotdogs and fries . those frys ..... oh those fries . they are like the godfathers of the fresh cut french fries . the portions are so big they are almost offensive . perfectly cooked everytime they literally have it down to a science . they 're sandwhiches and pizza are pretty good also . something for everyone there ! hope to see this longtime pillar of the neighborhood survive another 50 years !
american	) . eggplant parm is my go to , the hubby always gets the alfredo pasta !
american	this is the spot when you are drunk af leaving the 4am club . sleezy vegas but perhaps the best breakfast on the strip . open 24 hours , the food good , the environment is lots of laughs and drunks . all in all this is a true liddo vegas gem .
american	this place is everything you 've ever wanted from an american bar / restaurant . with great atmosphere and almost all tasty grilled cheese creations , you 'll secondly definitely be coming back for more . only downside is that you 'll probably need to wait a really long time for your seat .
american	if you are a fan of excellent french cuisine this is the place to go . keep in mind this is not your typical trendy scottsdale restaurant . this is a restaurant that has great character and charm . the croissants pre meal are to die for and their dishes are always on point ! the salmon is my personal favorite and the service has always been great . not to mention the complimentary desserts offered after dinner are divine . we are always the youngest couple there but we would like to keep it that way ; )
american	there 's literally a lake right behind this restaurant which makes it so lovely ! i got a lot of " date night " vibes from this place . inside has a pretty formal atmosphere . i ordered the fish and mash potatoes . the dish was pretty good . i enjoyed my moms dish more though ! she ordered the lobster roll- soo bomb . the service was okay as well . love pcc ! next time , we 'll definitely dine outside on the patio !
american	here they are @ timbers sunset ! this place serves honor to the original tavern @ this location " the brewery " a little pricey , but all timbers are . well worth it ! very clean & just right music ! bartender , shane ( ? ) very accommodating . can 't wait to try breakfast !
american	it can be quite discouraging seeing a huge line to get into the restaurant but it is totally worth the wait . the service is excellent and fast despite it being packed . the food ... oh my god ... the food ... let me start off by saying even the water was delicious . yes , the water tasted like watermelon . little things like this make me so happy . you even get a small plate of fruit before your breakfast arrives.the portions are very generous . i ordered the beautiful truffle and my plate was overflowing . it was delicious . my friend had the eggs benedict and she also enjoyed it . this place is definitely a gem that you have to visit .
american	this place is the best ! rock star brewery ! surprised they haven 't made it to the national level ! sam adams watch out ! ! all the beer is great , 8th street and kilt lifter are probably hands down the best ! there food is outstanding . very unique with the arizona chicken rolls with the jalapeno dipping sauce ! that could be a meal in its self . ive had the salmon blt , 5 stars ! the blue cheese burger , 5 stars . fish and chips 5 stars ! great work great location .
american	i 've wanted to come here for so long , and the time finally arrived ! i love brunch . i especially love big brunch . i hated myself a little after finishing my delicious scramble at hash house agg because my belly couldn 't stretch enough to down the whole thing . or any of the biscuit . or the fruit . or all the potatoes . good news : leftovers ! hostesses were so-so . waiter was very friendly . nothing super exciting about the decor . but who cares , my face was buried under too much egg and cheese to notice anything else .
american	a very casual and upscale diner with outdoor seating and with huge selection of food with generous portions . this deli has something for everyone . this is a family owned and operated establishment tucked in a quiet enclave in beachwood , away from the hustle and bustle of the mall crowd . friendly service and a chef that can cater to specific needs as they arise . open for breakfast lunch and dinner with a huge sunday brunch . give it a try and you will be back again for sure !
american	i 've been here once , and i need to return one of these days . i had a cheeseburger , fries , and a drink , and yes , i liked my meal . treasure the local places while they 're still around . i 'm glad this place is , and it almost makes me wish i had grown up in phoenix , rather than northern california . ^ _ ^ ;
american	i got the sage chicken and waffles and my girl go the brown sugar banana pancake with eggs and sausage . everything was absolutely unreal and the portions were too big for one person to finish on their own . the bloody mary 's were also a hit . will frequent every time i end up in vegas .
american	great food at reasonable prices . service staff very attentive . kitchen a bit slow but the food was so goood it was excusable .
american	awesome gyros and homemade chips ! you have to check this place out .
american	bbq was really really good ! sauces come on the side ... finally a bbq place that doesn 't smother the great flavor of their meats with a ton of sauce ! pulled pork was phenomenal , ribs were fall off the bone good ! mac & cheese and cole slaw definitely reminded me of home . the owners are very welcoming which is something this town lacks in . all i can say is yum !
american	if you 're cravings awesome crepes ... this is the place to get me . the place is very cute inside .... the outside is deceiving when u drive up . the crepes are huge ... and so many ingredients to choose from ... and yes they have me with nutella too = ) we shared a smoothie together but really should 've gotten too cause it was delicious ( the will ) we kept fighting over it ... ha salad was fresh and good portion size ... will definitely be back to have breakfast crepes ... service friendly and attentive
american	best ribs we have had in a long time . hush puppies come with an odd sauce ( possibly british salad cream ? ) but the beans and coke slaw are excellent !
american	cannot go wrong with this place . great food , and their freshly brewed beer keeps me coming back !
american	the reuben was great and they have dr. brown 's soda which is always a good sign ! will definitely visit again instead of going to a larger chain for lunch !
american	a hidden gem- clean , friendly , and fairly priced , i would return for breakfast without reservation .
american	everything great ! food , service , atmosphere , martini 's ..... wow . the fingerling potato appetizer is huge , , enough for 5-6 i think . the toffee dessert was the best , even if you think you are full , , get it !
american	everything was delicious ! the staff was friendly and made sure we were well taken care of . loved every item they had there especially the warm , fresh naan . i will definitely be coming back . it totally beats down the host that 's down the street from it .
american	food and service is excellent . i had sea bass special and it was prepared perfectly , flaky and moist . bf had lobster ravioli which was equally delicious . they have a good happy hour as well . will be back .
american	i have eaten here several times after i went here for an event . the quality of the food is like any fine dining restaurant to include the service . sitting outside with the water next to the golf course is very relaxing . it is truly hidden off of las vegas blvd near the welcome to las vegas sign . i have had several menu items and today i had the lobster cobb salad with tomato soup . great lunch place ....
american	i 've been here more than a handful of times and their barbecue never fails to disappoint . the brisket is always tender , the portions are gigantic , their sauces are delicious ( and plentiful ) , and the fries are terrific . and i love the cornbread ! the servers are also very friendly and knowledgeable about barbecue , and will answer any questions you have far better than a yelp review can . i think this place is a must-visit if you are in the area and not a vegetarian .
american	old school diner located in the eureka casino . friendly service and great food . we ordered the pork belly bao ( comes with 2 and oh so delish ) , short rib grill cheese ( perfectly grilled ) , short rib rice ( short rib was so tender ) and the fat choy burger ( beef patty , short rib , bacon and a runny egg ) . will definitely be back !
american	great back patio , beer selection and really surprisingly great food . must try .
american	great burgers and fries , and a nice quiet place for lunch downtown . loved the fried egg burger
american	great food . old school diner feel . food is always fresh , delicious and greatly priced .
american	highly recommend . diverse menu nice wine selection and prices are right for the family . owner is friendly
american	i consider myself a wing conesuer . atl wings are my ultimate favorite , nothing else like ' em ! ! ! many different flavors- i love the seasoned wings . lets not forget the sides- my choice is spicy tots and onion rings with a large red kool aid ! ! ! and if you have a sweet tooth you better have the honey biscuits too ! ! ! i would like to add that the staff is awesome too ! ! ! ! enjoy your wings ! ! ! !
american	i found this place through to 's finest food passport and was pleasantly surprised . the passport allowed us to order just the chicken and waffles ( no side , and none needed ) . this has to be one of the best fried chicken i 've had and most notably because of the sauce . the chicken was not drenched , but it was certainly well dressed and the sauce was a rich maple taste which complimented the salty , crunchy batter . glad the passport brought me here and will definitely recommend to others !
american	i love the quarter chicken with fries , smothered in some of the best gravy i can find in the city . the corned beef on a kaiser is also an amazing sandwich from here . staff is very friendly , the food is cheap , and it tastes amazing . some of the best comfort food !
american	delicious food , huge servings , and incredible service . i had the gyro plate , and my dinner partners had chicken shish kabob , mahi mahi , and the filet kabob . all of us raved about our meals and would like to come back to expand our knowledge about persian food .
american	so kind and friendly to everyone who comes in the door . best selection in town , there are a few new places that have sprung up over the last couple years but nobody beats grabhams ! ! !
american	this dive bar makes some of the best burgers in town . while the lunch crowd keep this place busy , if you are looking for a place to grab some food at night , i highly recommend it . the bartenders and staff are very friendly , making sure you get your food and any drink ( s ) quickly .
american	great spot for an early morning weekend breakfast . my wife and i really enjoy the food and especially enjoy the outside dining area and the view of quiet ( weekend ) downtown mesa main street . the menu seems to be ever changing with specials that keep you wondering what are they going to do next . parking and seating is very limited , hence the restaurant name , but worth it .
american	the food is great ( i love the humongous fungus and the pancakes during their breakfast time ) . the service is always great . friendly staff and quick meals . i recommend this to anyone who loves a good burger in etobicoke .
american	we were greeted with a smile , our server was extremely friendly , and the food was delicious . my mom had the vegetarian platter i had the falafel wrap all for $ 20 with tip ! as we were leaving both gentlemen that were in the kitchen thanked us for our business . it was such a simple gesture but it really went along way . definitely going back and definitely recommend this place .
american	stumbled upon it with friends after trying the escape room next door . wide drink selection , better than average bar food , friendly and quick staff . large seating areas , and plenty of televisions for your pittsburgh sports needs .
american	located inside planet hollywood casino , earl does practically no outside marketing or advertising . possibly the greatest sandwhich i have ever eaten .
american	this is a challenge to walk to from the strip , but not impossible , so i recommended getting a cab . it is definitely worth the trip , though . it was cool enough for us to eat outside , which was very pleasant . our waitress was very knowledgeable and made great recommendations . i has the mac and cheese and it was delicious .
american	a hidden gem in market square i recommend the italian beef ! ! !
american	friendly staff . great beer selection and daily specials . eclectic menu . including the beautiful and tasty doughnut burger and cinnamon sweet potato tots .
american	order at the counter and pick a seat ! your dinner will be brought to your table . don 't forget the gravy for your fries - it 's amazing !
american	finally there is a good quality italian food place to eat at over here . i ordered the filet and it was top notch . i met the owner and he really cares about his customers and makes sure each plate is the absolute best .
american	the food was really good - some local dishes , some seeminly cajun influence . the menu was somewhat short , yet almost everything looked really good . the prices might be a bit high , but worth the price , in my opinion . not your every day restaurant , but a nice treat .
american	service is top notch too ! my girlfriend and i have found our new sat morning breakfast spot .
american	a hidden gem in oakmont great food with eclectic menu never had a bad meal there atmosphere is relaxed and unpretentious always great service and great beer list
american	i 've had better steaks , but the atmosphere can 't be beat ! the bread basket and black bean soup are both delicious , as are the mashed potatoes .
american	great breakfast spot and we even drove out to this place two days in a row on our last trip . don 't miss the banana nut muffins as they are delicious .
american	we loved the ambience and cabin like feel with the mesquite wood smell . the calamari was great , a couple people ordered the pulled pork sandwiches and loved them , all 5 of us gave thumbs up on the fries , the burger was great and the parmesan crusted fish was also good . i will definitely be spreading the word on this place and coming back to try more . after looking at the pictures , i 'm eager to check out happy hour : )
american	my bowl of steel cut oats was nothing special , but sometimes that 's a great thing . the cinnamon apple pancakes my eating companion ordered were so good i went back for lunch just to get them myself . one of the waitresses was very kind , friendly , and accommodating . no request of mine was met with trouble , which i use as a determinant of good service ( since i can be like meg ryan at times ) . recommended if you are looking for a good breakfast .
american	smokey goodness and a cool hipster feel . it 's a small place , maybe only 25 guests max , but the food and atmosphere is worth it . i ordered sous vide hanger steak ... so flavourful and so tender . i could have ate it with a spoon . will definitely come back when i 'm in the area . attentive service too .
american	as a " philly guy , " i can really appreciate a good sandwich . this place has a great blt and tomato soup . the staff was friendly and very attentive . my ice tea was never empty . speaking of ice tea , that also was very special . flavored with passion fruit i believe . their breakfast all day menu looks appetizing . i 'll have to stop back to try it .
american	i stopped in for lunch and was very impressed by the menu as it had many " favorites . " so i went with the all beef hot dog w / fries for a quick lunch and was super impressed that it came freshly prepared on a slightly toasted bun with hot shoe string fries . i will be back !
american	it 's excellent every time we go . the brisket is the best i 've ever had . the desserts are to die for . the sides are down-home cookin ' at it 's finest . i wish their hours were extended !
american	i 've passed this place so many times . i went here for a christmas party . had the stir burger , it was great ! nice atmosphere , nice people . we also had the salmon salad which was fine as well . would go there again .
american	i was surprised to find an antique shop that you have to walk through to get to diner . the atmosphere was very welcoming . the waitress amanda was a 5 star and represented her company very well . i ordered the egg salad sandwich and couldn 't decide on my side when she ask if she could recommend one . my wife ordered the bogart which was a huge roast beef sandwich and side of slaw . the bread on both sandwiches was the best we 've ever had . we will be back and bring friends and family .
american	the service was outstanding , the wine chosen with the help of the manager was wonderful and the food was simply great . my girlfriend and i both tried the linguini fra diavlo . it was the best we have ever experienced on the west coast . this is a restaurant that we highly recommend .
american	was out visiting family and they took us here . so glad they did ! my 5 year old niece says chicken wings are her favorite food and she can eat 28 . 28 ! after sitting next to her at dinner here , she is correct . i saw her do it . really really tasty food . i can 't wait to come back . chicken wings , fries , pizza , pulled pork - yum .
american	some of the freshest and visually appealing dishes i 've seen in a while . their seafood dishes worth travelling for . seared tuna w pistachio and above all their pear salad with candied walnuts ... worth every penny . above all , great atmosphere ... soft music and lighting accompanies the meal in a clean and warmly furnished restaurant with wood , cream and neutral colours . i know where i will be hosting my next bday party !
american	amazing farm-to-table freshness and unique dishes i 've never had elsewhere . the executive chef is down-to-earth and brings so much of his personality into his food . tries to get regionally farmed meats and veggies , there 's even a bellagio rooftop herb garden used for sensi . he was even a winner on chopped last season . tlc roll , poached pear salad , tongue and cheek , lamb chop , coffee and donuts dessert , ice bubble assorted sorbets ... all to die for !
american	one of the better salads you can buy in the area . i have had every salad that they have and their chicken salad is my favorite . the place is clean and the staff is friendly , a nice lunch spot .
american	my " sammich " is always freshly made and portions are astoundingly generous . each " sammich " takes a unique spin on a cultural dish , and although not a huge selection , every single sandwhich i 've tried has been amazing . highly recommended !
american	just spent a week in nyc , and secret pizza 's slices were even better than the big apple 's imho .
american	like les said , don 't let the outside fool you . walked in and the atmosphere was very nice , very professional , very home-y . great for families . menu was large and the service was good . food was very good and a great price . my wife and i spent about $ 17 ( including tax and tip ) . food comes in large volumes , too--we were stuffed ! an unbelievable deal--don 't miss it ! we 'll definitely go back a lot !
american	phenomenal service , incredible food , all in a historic building with lots of charm . ample parking is available in a large , free lot . sure , the surrounding neighborhood isn 't exactly great , but that 's not the restaurant 's fault . we will be back .
american	probably the most affordable gourmet sandwich and more shop in summerlin . the decor is minimal but very hip . while you wait for your delicious food you can play pool , ms. pacman or pinball . i have been there several times and had delicous sandwhiches but this time i chose to get an egg white omelet . probably the best i ever had . i got to choose my ingredients and then i watched the chef cook it . yum and healthy. highly recommended
american	searching for a brunch place close to our hotel and we weren 't disappointed by real mo-mo 's at all . knock out was the pannenkoeken , which my usually picky four-year-old devoured . my ham benny was delicious and the potatoes were exactly the right ratio of crunchy to soft . service was also great . we 'll definitely be back .
american	seriously , the best burgers in town . all the staff are so friendly and i actually want to try everything on the menu . on my first visit i tried one of their specialty burgers , the bacon explosion and i will go so far as to say it was the best burger i ever had . their fries were on point as well , perfect amont of crisp . i also really like how you can see into the kitchen from the dining area . highly recommend this place ! i 'm pretty tiny and barely finish a plate sometimes but everything was so good not a crumb was wasted .
american	skip the buffets and go here : ) the food is great and the atmosphere is even better ! large servings too !
american	amazing food in big portions , affordable prices , fantastic and friendly service , and a delivery service that 's one of the fastest in town ! i can 't praise vickie 's diner enough . their grilled pork chops and new york steak are so good and filling you won 't believe their prices .
american	the ambiance of the place is perfect for a first date or a family night out . the service was fast and friendly . most importantly , the food was delicious ! ! i had the parmesan encrusted talapia and it was phenomenal . my father and i went there for to celebrate my exams being over and he loved it too . when the waitress found out she was sooo sweet and even gave us a celebration cake . it was such a sweet gesture ! ! then , after dinner we hung out at the lounge downstairs and just chilled . it was a perfect end to a perfect dinner .
american	i used to live in chicago where they have some of the best gyros shops around and this place is right up there . btw try the chicken ! ! !
american	this is a cleveland based company so you know they must have great corned beef . i got a corned beef sandwich and it was fantastic . the sandwich was huge and the meat was fresh . apparently their gyros are amazing too , but i didn 't try one . also yelp has them listed as extremely expensive currently , but that is a lie as all of the menu items were under 10 dollars and most of the sandwiches are 6 or 7 bucks . hanini 's is in a run down neighborhood so if you are a snob you may want to go elsewhere .
american	this place is the best choice in the area . a pleasant surprise amongst all the car dealerships and industrial buildings . the decor is shabby chic with oversized chairs and sofas to get comfy in . service is warm and friendly and the food is great too . traditional with a modern flair to make it interesting . try the tortilla soup it is top notch and the burgers were prepared perfectly .
american	this quaint little restaurant is on a lake in north west las vegas and has an amazing view ! i 've dined here a handful of times and had great service every time . food always comes out hot and in a timely manner and servers are always on point . prices are a little steep for the location and quality but the views and ambiance is amazing ! i would recommend this place .
american	the menu is small but mighty . the vibe is relax . our brunch was delicious and unique . if you 're in the area , this place is well worth checking out .
american	the food was really tasty and the service was on point . we felt very welcomed and enjoyed our visit ! definitely will be back !
american	tuna tartare was awesome as were the scallops with chorizo and cauliflower . ask for charles to help you navigate the incredible beer menu . he is super knowledgable . beer list is so extensive they give you an ipad to navigate .
american	i always wanted to have dinner here but i was always in a rush to see a movie . i finally made dinner plans with my volleyball team to check it out . a young gentleman by the name of jarrod waited on us and all i have to say " what a delight . " i tried the steam mussels accompanied by the lobster lettuce cups . both items were perfectly prepared ! my team and will definitely come back again , especially to see jarrod !
american	the food was incredible and inventive and the bartenders were super friendly . we ordered the smoke duck fat charro ( beans ) , seared banana cornbread and smoked rainbow trout tortilla and all were amazing . the beer flight was awesome . wish we had left room to try the " homemade ice cream flight " which is meant to be paired with the beer flight . we did have the blackberry chimichangas with a scoop of the blueberry chocolate chip ice cream and it was excellent . so glad we stopped in on our way out of phoenix- do not miss this !
american	we were looking for last minute dinner with a party of 8 table ten had reservations on open table . i picked a winner . hidden off the main hotel path but well worth it . menus is a little different for most of my party ( small town people who think red lobster is great seafood ) . well after hesitation they ordered and loved their meals .
american	: ) what an awesome place to have a beer and a burger ! pizza is awesome too ! we will be back . this is a must go to place if you 're in the area or feel like traveling out . they use meat from the local butchers too ! one of their brewmasters ( coughrobbycough ) is a stud and really knows what he 's doing ! come check him and his beer out !
american	what can i say ... great food , great variety of food , great staff , and nice dining environment . the variety of food and regular changing menu are my favourite things about kb 's . the staff are excellent and well-versed on their changing menu items . great place to take friends and family for a nice night out ... definitely a must try and definitely a hidden gem ..
american	good food , very responsive service , many televisions , and even goddard artwork ! a mini pub , and apart from an initial smoky smell when entering , this is a good spot for adults only for cold beer and domestic wines and good food , especially at hours when others close or limit their menus . certainly worth a try .
american	an establishment that actually has quality ingredients , a wide selection of options , assortments of vegetables , at a terrific set of sauces ( highly recommend the chipotle aoli ) . from building a rice bowl to a fresh salad , grazers has something for everyone . i 'm jealous of the students that get access to grazers from the comfort of kent state 's hub . definitely give this place a try .
american	i only wish the kitchen was open later . i am sure as charlotte continues to grow in popularity their hours will expand , especially considering the proximity to uptown .
american	you must try this place . the food is so fresh with many healthy options and smiling service . the menu is very unique and tasty ! i especially love the breakfast sandwich and the shakes . this is one of my new favorite breakfast spots . its great , food ready in a jiffy ; and the guys working the place are super friendly as well as easy on the eyes . you gotta check out this spot its truly a diamond in the rough of southwest las vegas .
american	homemade sandwiches and fresh toppings galore . clean , fresh and plenty of sides to choose from . a great american / greek style shop . i love the favor the foods have . not your cookie cutter chain = family owned . open for breakfast but have not tried yet . the chicken & portobello sandwich wa very tasty & filling .
american	the restaurant is attached to a mediterranean market and is no frills authentic mediterranean dinning . the flatbreads and wraps are great and the iranian entrees and menu options are excellent . always reliable and delicious .
american	this place always serves up good breakfast for $ 6 or lunch $ 7 and the service is outstanding . and to top it all of its a non-profit group that helps people get meals ! ! !
american	their soups are divine , i would guess made from scratch , and with a nice glass of wine , oh so yummy . sandwiches are good , too ! we 've always had excellent , prompt service . i will second another reviewers review- a nice place with very good food in a quiet atmosphere .
american	went for brunch on sunday . wasn 't sure what to expect when the gps had us turn into a residential development . so happy to have found them . food was wonderful . was busy so we had a small wait . love how they use the honor system in place of a hostess . standing in line was fun . got to talk with the others waiting . got the chicken and waffles . the spice was a nice complement . but the best part by far was the grits . there 's some about carolina grits . you cannot get that goodness anywhere else . a must try !
american	the ambiance is a but outdated but the food is excellent and i feel like a king . voted as best restaurant out of 100 by joanna kate 's in 2011 , i tend to prefer the more trendy establishments as it suits my age an therefor disagree personally with her list . we ate the appetizer pasta , steak tartar , lamb , partirage and ontario rhubarb .
american	this place might not be much when inside but what they cook up is really solid . the gyros are superb and are offered with fries inside ( get it ) . the burgers are a nice greasy hangover cure . their subs are really filling as well . if in the mood for greek style pizza with blots of heavy toppings , get an all dressed and one slice will equal two anywhere else
american	if this wasn 't located in the marriott lobby people would be raving about it . the creativity is only outdone by the delivery and flavor . go if you want some of the best new south food , don 't go if you are a snob who won 't go to a restaurant in a marriott no matter how good it is ! !
american	georgette and her staff go out of their way to provide the best service possible . a unique retail experience for foodies in the burbs .
american	inside the sonoran salon building , this little bistro offers stellar food with fabulous and friendly service . sandwiches / wraps customized to your liking with homemade sides . highly recommend this place .... we 'll return ! !
american	a hidden treasure on fremont downtown - golden gate casino 's 24hr cafe - breakfast available all day and highly recommended .
american	have only been a handful of times , but each time the food & service ( and cocktails ! ) are pretty dang impeccable . most recently i had the santa fe turkey melt ( kind of a slightly more upscale version of a fave sandwich i get at t-birds ) and opted for a salad as the side - very " healthy " and not some lame iceberg lettuce & carrot shavings deal .
american	went on a sunny saturday morning anticipating huge lines for brunch , was happy to get there and it was half empty ! quick , friendly service , and good eggs bennys ! this is the kind of place you could come to alone and not feel weird eating by yourself .
american	she is a great asset to the company and it is always our pleasure to do business with starr . we will keep coming back to this round table and ordering from here .... thank you again starr for excellent ( beyond ) excellent customer service . you are great ! hahahah see , i told you i would do a yelp review .... sorry for the few day delay ... but you are awesome !
american	their salads are delicious and beautiful and their mini cakes are amazing . picturesque food .
american	portions are small but flavorfull , desserts in particular being just the right amount of richness . drink service is above standard , but the wine variety and quality is a bit below par . encouraged for larger groups you want to impress , for the check if nothing else .
american	the food is generally good , our son loves the pancakes here , and i am a big fan of the crepes . the service is typically good but can be a little slow .
american	please come to santa barbara . i have never ordered anything i didn 't like . the veggie burger is so delicious , also the honey pasta salad . i always get their iced tea and an order of the hummus , i get the two flavored ones side by side .
american	i would say i love it for the variety , but i only ever get one of three things ... the pasta salad , the french onion soup , or the mushroom bisque . they are soooooo gooooooood ! i have been to a bunch of the area rockne 's , but i probably end up ordering from the fairlawn location the most since it is closest to my workplace . we get lunch here at least once a week and have never had bad service .
american	just 2 weeks ago i was here and as always the staff is very polite and speedy . i ordered off the secret menu a 3x3 with fries well done animal style and it was great. was super full but who cares when youre on vacation ! can never go wrong with in-n-out . go ! oh and heres a dope photo. yo ullll
american	now that we live in denver , when we have the opportunity to get some animal style burgers we do it . this little place is more of a local location - since it is off the strip and across the highway ! it 's a normal in-n-out , staff is friendly , no so hidden menu is available and food is great ! the fries i can 't say i 've ever been a fan , but they were hot and fried ! a good amount of outside seating and which delivery of the food !
american	i was pleased to find the food was also very delicious . quality food is often pricier but they put a lot of thought into their dishes which makes it worth it , i got the hippie chick wrap and it was very good .
american	the restaurant is spacious , quick to bring your food out , and affordable . the entrees are big , tasty , and hearty . the florentine benedict was savory and delicious . it came on an english muffin with cooked spinach , mushrooms , onions , fresh diced tomatoes , and hollandaise sauce . served with a side of country potatoes .
american	the menu is somewhat snooty , but i 've been very pleased with the breakfast items i 've tried . there is usually a wait , but there is lots of outdoor seating and tables to wait at . the cranberry nut bread is delish . they seem to be bike and dog friendly ( outside only of course ) . the service is ok and they really should figure out how to not keep people waiting when they have open tables , but overall this is great place . they have a website , so you can check out their menu before you go .
american	the local parks department runs this river front bar / bistro with a great outdoor patio that wheelchairs can navigate . i was waiting for leslie knope and her staff to come out and serve--but the staff was ultra-friendly and very professional . it was a great place to welcome nightfall and have our dinner as the crew teams when up and down the waterway .
american	dark lighting , nice live music , and plenty of local art . the menu has a nice selection and is vegetarian-friendly . i have had few problems with bar service and service in general . in one instance , the waitress took our order and then disappeared for long periods of time . no really a big deal . for the location , it 's a stand up place and in my opinion , one of phoenix 's most overlooked spots . would like to be back soon .
american	best fries ever . savored every bite . wish i was back in vegas for some more yumminess
american	love it , halibut amazing , apps are great ! the beer can 't beat it !
american	a restaurant in a former train station filled with stained glass and original wood work . we experienced wonderful dining as a group . had a salad , the calamari and the snapper hemingway . topped that with death by chocolate and officially had to toast to the wonderful waiter herbert .
american	nutella cookie is to die for but the best part was simon the bartender ! ! super friendly and funny ! !
american	service staff is always top-notch . both the beer and wine lists are good , mixed and specialty drinks are nicely done .
american	it 's not great but it 's not terrible either . they say people " end up at dennys " - i always end up at stacks and yolks . i like their location at 7150 s durango , dr. - it 's convenient . i am nearly a vegetarian these days , so i try to get egg beaters or egg whites . what they sell is ok , but not as good as it could be . waiter staff is very very friendly . i especially like how prompt they are about bringing water to your table .
american	our waitress was very friendly . dinner portions are huge , even split are more than enough for two people . will definitely be back .
american	not enough to eat as a meal though ( comes w 2 bite sized ) . burger was decent . shrimp salad was really delicious , tart , and creamy . crushed pepper mills would be a vast improvement for this gourmet-ish restaurant . not a fan of curry ketchup personally .
american	prepared just right to my specifications like i know they do steaks ! i was there with a very large party , so between all of us , most of the major menu items were ordered . no one , and i mean no one had anything but rave reviews for their food . located inside the m resort , this place makes the trip to henderson worthwhile . i 'll be back !
american	wide open spacious restaurant . love the fresh and healthy concept !
american	that was a hell of a meal . great service . five stars
american	bellagio 's buffet is the best around town . i 've been to planet hollywood and wynn , and they don 't compare . i really like how they set up the food , and the selection they offer . but beware , try to get there before the peak times 12-1pm is usually a long wait , or dinner time 7-8 . you can end up waiting for an hour . so i guess you could try to be a preferred guest by throwing down a couple of g 's at a black jack table . or you can be smart and come at an earlier time to avoid the wait .
american	hummus was very tasty and fresh . gets busy so would go before lunch rush
american	that 's all i 'm going to say . that and the double dip . ok , that 's two things . whatever . just go if you 're reading this . people are lovely and helpful as well . some are so helpful it 's almost sarcastic , which is a fun game too .
american	service gets 5 stars , as well . both fleur and burger bar are reasons for keller to be proud .
american	i have been an on and off low-carb dieter for years and consider chelsea 's ahi tuna tacos with a side of cottage cheese to be the closest thing to hedonism a low carber can experience . the soft taco shells come on the side , so you can just attack the ahi , a little guac , and the taco fixins without restraint . this is besides the fact that it 's a clean , well managed , high service operation . you won 't be disappointed .
american	flatbread cured pepperpni is great . calamari is good . ehhh on mac n cheese and sweet potatoes gnocchi ... would probably get something else . sauces on all was well done .
american	if cleveland is manhattan , then surely you are its new jersey . i guess that 's what i like about you . i 'm not a manhattan-type of person . grew up in the ' burbs , i currently live in the ' burbs , and my favorite movie is the burbs . ( man , that tom hanks . is there anything he can 't do ? ) this underappreciated gem of the neo brewing scene is a pretty solid go-to spot when you find yourself stalking the streets of historic downtown willoughby hungry for a fix . the beers are nothing short of terrific . peanut butter cup coffee porter ? didn 't even know her ! and so on and so forth .
american	everything i 've tasted on their menu is good . they have an extensive menu for all tastes .
american	best damn pancakes this planet has to offer ! we visited short stack on a friday morning after completing a free workout at the capital with november project and i was hesitant at first of ordering the sweet potato oatmeal pancakes but they were to die for ! also they have a blind order special which if you order you get half off . this time it was an omelette which was very tasty .
american	best burger ive ever had ! ( shack stack ) and they close at 2am not at 00 : 00 as says on yelp
american	this is the best bbq in phoenix . i had the brisket sandwich . it was very tender with a nice smoke ring . i enjoyed it with the hickory sauce . fast service . clean establishment ... it is even better with the new renovations . if you have not been here , you need to go .
american	i cannot wait until next november to have the sandwich of the month . it 's was thanksgiving in a sandwich . i loved it . i wish there was more locations . closer to me too .
american	best experience in a long time . come hungry ! ! great service , unbelievable meats , amazing salad bar , and good wine selection . wish there was one in sacramento !
american	delivery in ahwatukee of fried chicken , homemade mac n cheese , and sweet potatoes ! really good food , fast friendly delivery , good prices .... can 't wait to order again ! we absolutely loved it ! found the place unintentionally on eat24 , and took a chance . so glad we did ! ! !
american	on your way into the restaurant you 'll pass by a fresh herb garden that the parlor actually uses in their cooking . wonderful options for building your own pizza or if you 're a little more adventurous they have their own creations that are fantastic as well . my husband is pretty picky about his food but with the build-your-own he was able to create a pizza he loves . the atmosphere is so lovely esp. at night on the patio . we always sit outside whether it 's january or july and have always been very comfortable . great place for a one on one date or with a group of friends !
american	get the chicken tenders that are served in a shoe ... you will not regret it !
american	had the skirt steak and it was perfect . the service was great even when we had a large party . someone i was with had the burger and i tried it and it was also fantastic . will definitely be going back ! and their shareable sarris ice cream sundae was delicious . hand cut fries were good also .
american	haven 't had legit detroit coneys since i moved here in 05 , they were so good . we drove from glendale to come eat here , that 's how good it was . also the owner came back while we were finishing up , said hello and shook our hands , super nice guy . i recommend this place for sure !
american	if you are craving some good southern food stop in . the mac n cheese , biscuits and sweet potato dumplings were heavenly . great fried chicken ! liver mush toast and the kale salad were the yummy surprise dishes of the night . not one complaint . definitely get the mint julep . service was awesome and the decor was done right . do not leave without trying the banana pudding . you 're welcome . btw this is in noda so expect to search for parking .
american	it 's a build-your-own-burger , little hippie joint . the interior is a flash back to 1980 with some happily unique decor . i built my burger with a beef patty , potato bun , no cheese ( lactard ) jalapeños , tomatoes , pickles , and grilled onions , and added bacon . holy moly it was soooo good . and i 'm a burger critic . the only thing was a little unimpressed with was that their plethora of flavored lemonade are flavored with syrups , instead of fruit or more " natural " flavors . love it ! i 'll be back next time i 'm in phoenix !
american	shorter menu , but i didn 't feel like anything was missing . modern , totally instagram-able interior . a + friendly and knowledgeable staff , willing to make substitutions to the menu to accommodate a specific request . a couple different mimosas to choose from , both perfect with fresh fruit juice . latte was perfect , i could have had them all day . would definitely go back .
american	even if you are gluten free with celiac . no cross contamination here ! very savory in flavor with good cheese and excellent seasonings . have also ordered their to go pizza and they are excellent . well worth your visit .
american	i hosted a corporate meeting a while back in april 2016 and ordered pizza from payless pizza 2 i was dubious until the first bite ! now that was a great pizza . ! the people attending the meeting took some back to their hotels and asked to have the leftovers for lunch the next day ! since that time every time a member of the company visits town they ask for " that awesome pizza " courteous staff , well priced , fast and delicious ! the best thing is the consistency of their product . its always tastes the same which is also ah-mazing ! ; - )
american	always come for lunch , because the service is quick plus the lowes discount . the new cookies are a great addition to the menu . i can 't speak for anything outside of the 3 piece tenders meal because that 's all i get .
american	so many vegetarian and vegan options ! the service was so attentive and the food was so delicious ! if you 're ever in this part of town , do your stomach the biggest favor and stop by perisan garden !
american	we got the hot rocks steak and it was cool and great flavor . would have loved to have more pieces is steak but price is a factor . this is vegas ! then we had bolegnese with a side of adult tater tots . very good food . server was sweet and helpful . i would return !
american	we were promptly seated and greeted by our server becky . we ordered drinks , an appetizer , and entrees , all of which were delivered with perfect timing . the steaks were seasoned to perfection & cocked exactly as we had ordered . our waitress really knew what she was doing , and had a great attitude ! we will definitely be back , thanks becky !
american	however , this location isn 't so bad because of the late hours so we can visit after the bar . this review is for the fun times i 've had in this location - especially nights after the cameron house ! sometimes there 's live entertainment - courtesy of common drunkenness . good times - especially after 2 : 00am ! the food still sucks ! four stars for the entertainment only !
american	this place has been around forever and will be for many more years . open late , it 's often a destination after the bars and before heading home . the subs are very simple , but somehow it just works . the turkey bacon is legendary . in high school i was allowed to be late after lunch if i brought my teacher some bellies . thats how good it is .
american	i got myself the chicken & waffles and man was i surprised with how well everything they had went together ! i will definitely be back again for more and different food they offer .
american	add a huge mason jar of the sweetest & reddest koolaid ( or sweet tea - depending on my mood ) and a side of grits drowning in melted butter and i 'm a happy girl . their red velvet cake is also amazing . i know fried chicken and waffles seem like an odd combination but it 's really interesting and satisfying - with the syrup and hot sauce for the chicken .... yum yum . it 's one of my family 's favorites ! ! ! try it ! ! ! !
american	you can tell they take their time in making their pies . i love this place it 's sucha good find ! the pies are amazing they 're easy to heat up and full of flavor ! me and my co worker just recently visited and nearly cleared them out when we purchased 10 pies !
american	with a small at home setting and friendly staff like the waitress bekah your sure to get a good drink and some good food . although i don 't know the number to the joint , i should have provided an accurate address .
american	fresh chicken kabobs and their rice is to die for hands down my go to place for moroccan food in charlotte .
american	i ordered simple steak kabob and garlic fries and it was off the chart . flavor , flavor , flavor . i order this at other greek places but it 's never been this good . it 's close to my house so i can already see myself coming up here frequently . well priced and will exceed your expectations .
american	he treated him with such kindness . great people .
american	wow .. we were on the way to hoover dam and needed to find breakfast . we yelped and found this gem of a place in henderson ! i ordered an omelette with sausage and the wife ordered belgium waffles . both the plates were huge and so tasty . the service was fast and nice . we were so happy to find such a nice place and the flavors exceeded our expectations down right . we highly recommend the omelette house and will be back again for sure !
american	anyhow , the food is always a treat. it 's an occassionally changing menu and though i 'm out of touch with my dessert home , rest assured the deserts are consistently amazing and it really seems like one of the better and lesser known bangs for the buck in phx .
american	always have to go to a capriottis when i 'm in vegas . no matter which location i go to , the sandwiches taste same . favorites are the bobbie , and the cheese steak with everything .
american	so my amazing parents , b & b , brought me here for some guilty pleasure ! amazing pizza ... a piece is a meal ! better than vincent 's !
american	like my favorite movie hmm okay walked in .... nice deco tables full and aroma of food yummy in here hmmm spotted their famous frozen hot chocolate * thinking ... we got a table , waitress was very nice . still thinking is this frozen chocolate gonna be too sweet or something i will not like ? placed my order took one sip and omg ! best ever and perfect .i 'm not in vegas and craving it right bout now ..... go and sip on one yummmmmm
american	robin n. rand h. and myself went here for lunch and it looked like they were going to get one or two stars because most of the trays were empty . well as it turned out they have all these empty trays but they cook your dog when you order it which is much better anyway . there are about ten different hot dogs you can order and 3 i ate were all great . they also have all the hot dog condiments imaginable . the bbq chicken wings are also very good.so if you like a good hot dog you will love g 's .
american	we couldn 't stop smiling the entire time we were there ! charmingly diner-like environment , fun and friendly service , delicious hot dogs , fries , soups , especially aunt kate 's beans ! the cole slaw was the best i 've ever tasted ever--in any restaurant on this side of the mississippi ! we will definitely return--and soon ! worth the 40 minute drive for us--and a great place to have lunch before touring downtown medina including castle noel !
american	right ? slap on some cheese , a couple ounces of chopped onions , maybe fancy it up with some sliced tomato , some jalapeño , or perhaps a dash of celery salt and some chili . what if bbq sauce and coleslaw sounded good at the moment ? what if that hot dog you had in new york that one time makes your tummy grumble ? if you can find it without google maps , or know where it is and never thought twice , because it 's just a hot dog , think again , or try again ... unfortunately , a liquor license costs more than your house most likely , so you won 't find the greatest hot dog condiment here ... beer .
american	i haven 't visited this restaurant for over 3 years . it is still awesome , we ordered the signature blueberry butttermilk pancakes , scones for 2 , and big brunch skillet !
american	i 've been going there for 14 years now . they served me my first hummus . i 've had a number of friends who worked there over the years . the service is the only dynamic factor in my rating . i 've run the gambit as far as that is concerned . overall they are solid . if you are a dip person , try ordering a half and half order of their garlic dip and hummus . totally worth it . their shawarma always hits the spot . the falafel platter is the best buy for the money .
american	thank you for finally opening a restaurant in az ! every chicagoan grows up on this food , and we adore it . best french fries around , great charbroiled burgers , and you can never go wrong with a chocolate cake shake . delicious chocolate shake + piece of delicious chocolate cake inside the shake = heaven . love me some portillo 's !
american	you get a view of a mall show ( fun ) and the people watching is a plus ( double fun ) . you have given me ideas to bring home . they start your meal off with a great hummus dip . yummers . i had a chicken salad sandwich with thin raisin toast . oh the flavors . it was blissful and i vowed to copy it somehow someday . worth trying if you 're in the area .
american	" i know . bomb ass analogy ! the chicken fingers are hot and tender ( all white meat ) . the breading is crispy , flaky and not greasy . the french fries ... perfectly salted . the texas toast ... garlicky and crunchy . cole slaw is always substituted for extra toast ! save the cabbage for ya grandma ! inside tip : get 5 extra sauces and extra napkins . anyway , go through the drive thru with ya little chitlins , spank ya booty and sing god bless america as you munch on some bitchin fingerlickin chicken !
american	the answer is more than any other restaurant downtown ! ! the sampler breakfast ! what can i say ? eggs , sausage , bacon , ham , potatoes , pancakes , fruit and rye toast ! coffee included at 9.99 . wonderful food , excellent portion sizes in an elegant but fun environment . who wouldn 't love that ? ? we can 't wait to go back for more ! !
american	there seems to always be a line outside to eat in , and also a line for take-out . we got 1lb of smoked meat to go for $ 16.95 ( cold ) and ate it the next day as a picnic lunch . good stuff . taste : 4 / 5 service : 3 / 5 atmosphere : 2 / 5 value for money : 4 / 5 would i come again : yes
american	what can i say about this place ? it is really good food . i have had the italian beef and combo sandwiches when i have come in . they are fantastic . the service is great . i looked across the room at lunch and it was pretty busy . the food on others tables looked amazing too . i especially think the tacos may be my next order . the salads come in huge bowls so they would be easy to toss more if you need to . all in all , a great place to eat .
american	worth the wait to get in , once you 're in its all about having a great time . a place to enjoy bands and play in the game room .
american	the interior is simple and clean , yet sophisticated . i love how pure it is and i 'm happy they don 't put art up on the walls just to have art . less is more here in every way . the vibe here is very hip & vibrant with diners of all ages and food interests . the selection of breads and pastries would make anyone drool and i don 't even have a sweet tooth . the menu is simple and certain to delight everyone . be sure to ask for their daily special menu . seeing the parking lot full with diners lining up outside brings me joy knowing the blue door is here to stay .
american	i 've never had a bad meal there and they serve a gyro breakfast platter that will satisfy even the biggest appetites . they have even have ice cream , baklava and small mixed drinks for the person in need of a small libation . they 're hours are good , and there 's metered parking in the lot just around the corner , and there 's usually plenty of space . all together , this little corner gyro restaurant keeps my appetite spinning for more : )
american	this is madison ... and wisconsin , too . i think of the food as wisconsin staples , one step up . the ingredients are local and fresh , and i always leave happy . i 'm a fan of the walleye sandwich and green bay chili in particular . the bar and beer selection is absolutely fantastic ... well , save for that one " import " brew from minnesota : d i kid . grab a beer , an old fashioned , anything you 'd like , and just enjoy .
american	this place has great coffee and all the food is great . my fav is the pork carnitas rancheros , but the veggie benny is a close second , but so is the stuffed french toast , it 's a egg and bacon delight sandwiched between two thick pieces of french toast . it really is quite amazing . from hence forth all sandwiches will be used with french toast . it will end wars and develop peace around the world .
american	it 's one of the things that i actually miss about cleveland . there 's really not much , but this is one of them . gyro burger with fries for $ 4.25 ( that 's what it was five years ago ) has to be one of my top five meals of all time . a good sized hamburger patty topped by a huge chunk of feta , several slices of gyro meat , grilled onions , white sauce . not to mention the old skool terrel brandon pictures on the side of the table .
american	great for drinks , for lunch , for lounging and talking on the patio and having a bite to eat . the patio area is very inviting and comfortable . the interior is pleasing modern decor with great ligthing to set the mood . but i can never get a parking spot here ! and i am not a valet kinda gal . ( i was told they are opening another downtown location - so mayvbe they will rethink this )
american	i don 't miss the arctic temperatures in winter , i don 't miss the insane sales taxes ( higher than nyc ) , i don 't miss the rampant corruption in government , i don 't miss mid-western indifference , what i do miss are chicago hotdogs and i get them here ... and they are always good . matt ...... keep it up !
american	this place has the best food ! i started going there because the person who took me initially always got their chicken fingers . they are so delicious . i started taking my fiancé and it 's now our go to place .. uhh , everything is so amazing . check it out ! you won 't be disappointed !
american	my husband and i went for dinner sunday night . it was our first time there . i had been recommended by a coworker . pretty small restaurant , but it 's cozy . the little candles on the tables were a nice touch . we got the pie known as " fat uncle tony " ; which had sausage and bacon . best . pizza . ever . everything is fresh and just the right temperature . and the staff was super polite . we will most definitely go there again !
american	i 've been here on several dates and with friends and with my dog . at all times i felt like the place had a little hipster vibe . i love the fact that they seemed to be dog-tolerant . i don 't dare say dog friendly , as i 've hardly seen that in phoenix , but dog tolerant is enough to impress me in this city . thanks for always providing a good experience , pj .
american	i ate more polenta than i thought possible . worth coming back to try more .
american	that alone makes this place fantastic and worth a visit . awesome atmosphere . a great post-work stop off . or a perfect place to get drunk with your friends while experimenting with weird wisconsin brews or delicious flights . ok i should probably stop talking about the beer . the food is great , very wisconsin ( read : terrible for your health but amazing for your appetite ) . and the cheese curds are amazing . seriously , best in town .
american	they are perhaps the most well known for their gyros and meat platters . we got the greek fries to start , a huge appetizer dish topped with a generous amount of feta cheese . this dish was heavenly ! as my main , i decided to go for the octopus which came with a side salad . the meat was very tender but could have used a bit more seasoning . we also tried the gyro pizza which is exactly what it sounds like ! all in all , a delicious option if you are in the area .
american	decor is modern and warming - great for catching up with friends . i always get the scotch egg - spicy tomato jam has some good kick to it . love coming here on tuesday 's - cannot go wrong with buck-a-shuck oysters . steak and frites - never disappoints , portion quite large . their catch of the day special is refreshing - almond crusted fish with garlic kale and roasted potatoes . creme brulee is my favvvv dessert . they 're menu changes every few months - keeps you wanting to come back to try out the new features . wait staff extremely friendly . cocktails are refreshing .
american	how could a restaurant double their menu and maintain their quality ? well , they did ! i 've continued to enjoy the good seafood , especially their monday night crab legs special , shrimp , and hush puppies , and i finally broke down and tried brisket from their smokehouse menu . it was delicious ! i enjoyed their sweet barbecue sauce , too . i 'm still a fan !
american	everything is always fantastic . though during this last visit , the bread was a bit stale . aside from that we love the food here .
american	literally every inch floor to ceiling is covered in sports memorabilia and it 's really fun to walk around and look at it all . this place is such a dedicated u of wisconsin bar , the bar itself shaped in a w ! the staff was very friendly and attentive . we had some drinks , which were reasonably priced . we didn 't have any food , so i can 't really comment on that . i was a temporary cheese head just passing through town , but whether you 're a local or just passing though it 's worth a stop especially if wisconsin is playing !
american	a huge mound of fries - bacon , nacho cheese , footlongs - more food than you can eat - scooter is a wheelchair bound vet that serves up the best weiners , fries , burgers and get a shake because there is nothing better !
american	had a giant burger , which might have been one of the tastiest burgers i 've had recently . juicy and bacony yum . service was friendly and quick . the homefries was okay - a bit too soggy for my likings , but still pretty good . did i mention the delicious burger ? my mother got a salad , which turned out to be a giant salad. all delicious .
american	spot on ! you guys went above and beyond what we asked for and accommodated everyone in our party . of course the food was amazing ! not a single complaint from any one of us . we 've gone to eat there a few times and each time your staff is on point and the food is perfect . would be happy to recommend for any occasion . thank you for making our wedding great !
american	we were hesitant earlier in the day when they said they could handle our group , but the hesitation turned out to be without merit . they immediately sat the majority of our group , and had the rest of us with tables within 10 minutes . the servers were on top of it , and the food came out quickly and was delicious . we also really appreciated the vegetarian and gluten free options . management checked in multiple times with the group leaders to ensure everything was taken care of . you are all rockstars , thank you for making our group 's dinner a success !
american	they have everything from scrambled eggs , bacon and a huge pancake to crab legs and prime rib ! there was a new england clam bake , salad and food from many nations ( the hummus was excellent ) . the server who brought drinks was on top of it the whole time and even at $ 35 a person , it was well worth it .
american	we also tried the french toast and it was also very good . this place was fun , but busy ! come with patience and you won 't be disappointed .
american	fresh , progressive , customer focused and a can 't go wrong menu .
american	we have a 5 year old dachshund who lives for uncle bears . their outdoor patio is very accommodating to the doggies and has working misters during the summer months . their food and craft brew ( names after dogs btw ) is good as well . whether you have your best friend with you or not , definitely check out uncle bears .
american	yes , a pita jungle in our own neighborhood ! went tonight with husband and some friends , the food amazing , the service , excellent ! a special thank you to tanisha our server ! she made some great recommendations and answered all our needs tonight ! welcome to the neighborhood pita jungle !
american	every vegas mans hangover preference . all i have to say is , full montague ! ( and tomato soup ... with lots of water , mind you ) will cure that hangover .
american	been eating here since 2003 and i can never get bored with this food . that says something about this restaurant . now beware that all who you will be in contact with after eating here must also eat here ( the garlic factor ) , but hey .... who wouldn 't want to eat here ? ? ? ( twist my arm ! ) if you really want to get rid of some of the garlic breath for a little while , try the delicious baklavas .... yum !
american	my sweetie and i drove around tennessee and the carolinas this year for our vacation and just loved it . i am just now pasting all our mementos into our vacation scrap book and i ran across the receipt from our dinner at the global . it was a wonderful dinner so expertly and creatively prepared and was one of the many highlights of our trip . chef bernard brunet came out and talked with us about our meal , and i really liked that . we are a couple of foodies from the west coast and were so happy to find this place . loved it !
american	after hiking in the north chagrin metroparks , we decided to stop at the outside tables overlooking the falls . the menu didn 't offer a lot of choices , but we both decided on a burger . with the sound of the falls enhancing our conversation , you couldn 't help but feel a little frisky . my lovely wife of 33 years kept slapping my hands away . the romance was brought to the forefront with the ambiance . good food , good times . definitely worth trying .
american	they were a perfect desert on the way back up to the room .
american	just ate at outback in tempe and the service was excellent . aidan was very attentive . he read back our order and made sure our food was cooked the way we wanted it . the food was good and the service was excellent .
american	however this time i had an amazing time at the drive thru , the employee there had a wonderful attitude and instantly made my day with his compliment on my jacket and cheerful demeanor . although fast food is always hit or misses he definitely made it a hit . whoever was working today at the drive thru thanks for making my night ! as for the food its typical popeyes fair , what fast food operations do best is try to maintain consistency , they may have misses but what do you expect its fast food .
american	at first we were skeptic because they brought the wrong shrimp out at first but .. it 's unlimited so who cares . their old policy was too .ake us wait for fucking ever and fill us up on water and biscuits .. but this time .. eva did a good ass job . she was on top of her game .. getting us refills back to back . water ... all the shrimp we ordered came out quick . good ass service . thanks eva ! oh and ps eva if you 're reading this my gf did want the tarter sauce for her order thanks ! ! !
american	i really like the vintage vibes and the staff is super attentive ! i had challah french toast and a side of corned beef house . the french toast was fluffy , sweet , and had a crunch that has my mouth watering as i 'm writing this review . my boyfriend loved his vegetarian omelette . it was pretty fluffy too since he got it with egg whites . the portions are pretty large and not a long wait on a saturday morning !
american	a few of my favorites : donut tower , the flatbread and the a la carte omelette ! will definitely be back ! ! ! !
american	ain 't much to look at , but the dogs are exactly what a hot dog lover will love .
american	ain 't no better cheesesteaks in hendo , i guarantee ! ! !
american	this is the place in twinsburg where it 's at . gator 's been around for awhile and this place is always hoppin . great drink specials and their burgers are straight up butter . i got the cravin right now . see ya up there .
american	good service . great wings . love those fries too .
american	friendly , good food , good vibes . their unique menu items they create for us are always on point , too ! thank you !
american	this spot was down the street from the spot i rented and oh man , bombest food in town . their champion burger with mac and cheese was pretty dank . probably the best burger and mac and cheese i 've had . also their braised pork with fries was good too . i 'm definitely coming back to this spot every time i 'm in phoenix ! on top of that , their crew here are pretty entertaining . pretty hip spot !
american	attractive people in their mid twenties . penguins had their stanley cup team party here for good reason . food and drinks are good too .
american	stopped here for a bloody mary upon arrival and then for a bloody and breakfast upon departure bloodies were very tasty ( bartender indicates they make their own mix ) oj was fresh squeezed and delicious we had " the commuter " for breakfast ( a tasty breakfast sandwich that i recommend with turkey and avocado ) everything was reasonably priced with good sized portions . definitely a solid choice for the phoenix airport !
american	this place was a hit ! i went with the green chile burger . when i received the burger , it seemed a little small . but at the end of the meal it was the perfect size . the chipotle aioli was delicious . i even got an extra side to dip my fries . if you get stuck in the phx airport , this place will solve your hunger .
american	but the del mar salad at chelsea 's kitchen is the best airport food i have had .
american	twist was expensive but i was happy with the salad i ordered as well as a pasta appetizer . although the price was high , the food was great . my salad was fresh and the pasta was cheesy . the server was knowledgeable and was able to answer a question i had about the dressing . she made a good substitution suggestion for me . if i fly through terminal 1 again , i will make a point to swing by and check this place out again .
american	they have excellent subs here with lots of real roast beef and fresh toppings . this place is definitely worth checking out if you 're hungry in the airport .
american	their key lime pie is also quite tasty , though perhaps a little too rich for my taste . the service was nice as well . i would definitely go back if i found myself in that part of the airport again .
american	i was in no rush by the service ( bilingual ) was very polite and nice and quick . not sure i 'd go here in a rush to be safe though . the atmosphere is very good too . prices are as expected ; in the airport nothing is cheap . the beer is 3 stars , especially for the price . i had the spicy burger and it was well executed . my partner was pleased with her burger too .
american	on the recommendation of the security officers , we checked out cowboy ciao and were amazed at our experience . the menu was creative , combining fresh ingredients with good taste . i had the mushroom skillet , my hubbie had bruschetta and truffle macaroni and cheese . the bruschetta was so so , but the other two were truly yummy . perhaps most engaging was our waiter tj . he welcomed us as if we had just arrived into his own kitchen . made sure we knew how to reach him , brought our food and drinks promptly , and checked in frequently . never had airport food or service like this before !
american	beer is great as expected , burger and fries could have been hotter than was served , service is yet to be desired . had to ask for napkin and silverware . not very friendly either .
american	hubby ordered the hamburger club has been off the menu for years but they still make it for him
american	great potato pancakes ! be prepared to wait at lunch and on weekends . service is always good . cozy neighborhood spot .
american	located on the 3rd floor of the cosmo , its long corridor makes for a great experience to bump into those who had too much to drink . first class entertainment . then at the end of the tunnel , you are awarded with the best pizza in vegas . definitely a place to try .
american	i dont want to dpend $ 40 for breakfast around here , but being cheap will cost you too . the line to get in was quick , but it took about 10 minutes to get a server . still 10 minute wait for $ 10 breakfast is good .
american	the dishes are thoughtfully prepared and the ingredients are top notch . the menu is moderately priced and the wine list is extensive . we don 't expect much from restaurants in the luxor but this one was worth the trip .
american	just what we needed after getting back into town . he is leaps a bounds ahead of most other employees i 've come across .
american	how have i never written a review for this place is a carnivorian conundrum , given that i have been a customer since the mid 90 's . the links are juicy and delicious . the rib tips and ribs - superb . you can 't go wrong with anything on the menu . the prices are very reasonable , too . it 's a pretty no-frills strip-mall location ... but you aren 't going for the ambiance . you are going for the smoked meaty treats . the beans and cole slaw are smokin ' too , and the owner and employees are are friendly . omglolbbq i love a & j .
american	although the food is slightly overpriced , it is good . burgers are good , salmon is good , lettuce wraps are good , moscow mules are good . the ambience is warm and cozy . we usually sit in the bar and bartenders are attentive , accommodating , and friendly .
american	the owner is extremely friendly and welcoming , and the food is always hot and delicious ! i highly recommend the gyros and the spicy chicken pizza . their hot subs are also bomb .
american	he has provided the best experience yet at this location . very knowledgeable and very helpful . great food and great service you can go wrong here .
american	things you should eat while here : flaming cheese , need i say more ? we had a crisp and fresh salad and cucumber soup to start . the main courses where all delicious- one from the specials- a fish dish was a big hit . the roast chicken was juicy with crispy skin . good wine list . the pace of the courses was good . even when our server darted over to another table to sing opera to a guest . it seemed there where a lot of regulars there as well , which is always a good sign . would go back next time we are in town .
american	came in with the team last night for happy hour and dinner , and this place was perfect ! also super close to the hotel im at this week. happy hour prices in phoenix are the best - cocktails here were $ 5-6 and delicious ! i had the margarita , my team did wine and moscow mule. noms ! we kinda went to town on the happy hour menu - got 3 rolls ( the vegas roll was my favorite ) , stuffed mushrooms , crab dip ( so good ! ) , and the thai chili wings ( my colleagues crushed this ! ) dinner and drinks for 4 was around $ 100 before tax. amazing. i would come back here for sure .
american	ak47 is my all time favorite but zomfg if you have not tried the white widow on garlic with shrooms you are missing out to make it even taste better add some @ fuegomaya to it it will be your best bud
american	aka the 8th wonder of the world ... midnight diner is like disney for drunk / hungry young professionals after a night out in crown town .
american	even though our beloved kaufmann 's is gone , the tic toc lives on ! it has the usual food that you would expect for a quick bite to eat . sandwiches , hot sandwiches , a variety of dinner plates , salads , and specials that are usually very good . occasionally , they do a crab louis salad that is amazing ! the milk shakes and pies are great and you could not ask for better . i live 20 miles away so i rarely make it down but when i do after shopping ( and sometimes even before ! ) we stop and eat at the tic toc after a nice day of shopping and running the floors . long live the tic toc !
american	these are the best fries ever ! eating potato patch fries and going to kennywood is part of the pittsburgh summer . it 's almost worth the price of admission to kennywood alone ! yes , the lines are long , but they do go fast . they are always cut fresh right before being fried , unlike the fast food chains that double drop their fries . i always get the bacon and cheese fries and add ranch dressing and ketchup . other available topping include beef gravy , garlic salt , seasoned salt , and bbq salt . you will defiantly need a hand full of napkins as you are going to get very messy !
american	eclectic divey with kent coed servers and all walks of life . if guy fiery does a triple d around here , this would be the place ! gigantic menu and all the comfort food is great !
american	the calamari - awesome . i loved my filet and the potatoes with it . my husband had a decadent rissotto dish . we both loved it !
american	thick bacon slices , real cheddar cheese , a tasty burger patty made this burger under $ 7 is a bargain . the garlic romano fries were tasty but not " really " garlicy . thin and crispy , like those from inn-n-out , so the mild taste goes well with the crunchy texture ( like flavored potato chips , but better ) .
american	and the spot is of course really good and fun both for adult companies and families . will return for sure . and of course : patrick - good job man , decent service .
american	the process of ordering was a little different from what i am used to back in south carolina , but end result was some solid bbq . coleslaw was a pleasant surprise , i am typically quite particular about my slaw , it was tasty . long tables easily accommodate large crowds , but get in early before the crowd does or you might have to wander around . just off of i-10 and on litchfield , it is very convenient to get in and out in a hurry .
american	and a fat tire - great little co beer you can 't get on the east coast. perfect cure for the lunch after a long night . ,
american	i 've eaten in probably four or five of their locations around cleveland , and everyone is different . some are terrible , with bad food and bad service ( like the one in hudson ) . others are terrific . luckily , this is one of the better ones . it looks like a newer location and the interior is nice looking . our server was terrific , very attentive , very friendly , as was the other staff . all of our food was excellent . and they even had tastes of their version of " lady fingers " as freebies , for dessert . i would definitely be back .
american	their falafel is easily my favorite anywhere ! also , hummus and hot sauce is incredible , their wraps are delicious , and salads are great . they also have really good option for people who don 't like mediterranean / lebanese , like the honey mustard chicken wrap , and other salads / sandwiches / wraps . prices are so low ( shhh ... don 't tell them i said that .... ) for the quality and amount of food . their deserts are also fabulous . love love love loveeeeeee
american	our waiter was cory ! he is super ... at his job / sees everything quickly / has great insight constantly ... he knows his job well / wants to do his best .. we could tell ... sit at his table if you get the chance ... we sat at the far table .. on the floor ... in the bar area ! we want him every time , if possible ! he asked if everything was good ! the manager came around and asked how things were too ... our coupon worked like it was supposed too ... everything was terrific ! ! ! ! go there ! ! : ) : ) : ) : )
american	as i sit here writing this , nikki minaj is blasting through the speakers and it makes for the perfect place to follow up my saturday night . they offer lots of creative options and gluten-free and vegan as well ! which is great because i have several friends who fall into this category and it 's always tough to find a place for breakfast when they visit . parking can be tricky and the line does get long but their steamed bagels and sandwich creations are worth the visit . they don 't try to hard and that 's what i like about it . from the handcrafted menus , wiring on the walls and delicious food , you 're sure to be glad you came .
american	the have a lot of bbq and i think the best way to sample their variety is via the " a little bit of stuff " plate . its a combo plate , and you can pick 4 meats and 2 sides . i had their pull pork and that was good . their ribs were kinda tough . the sausage was fantastic . their brisket was also pretty good . lots of beer choices as well . overall , a fun place with good bbq and beer .
american	no frills quality food breakfast place with lots of coffee . usually packed weekend mornings and only accepts cash . plenty of good food at a cheap price .
american	the best white meat chicken , cooked in canola oil , can 't get much better than that . the special sauce is pretty great , i have yet to try anything else , its really that good . al is always down to shoot the shit and makes sure his customers are taken care of , can 't say enough good things about this place . as always , you get what you pay for .
american	each dish starting with appetizers then two salads that were amazing and all of us ended up eating off eating off each other plates since they all were amazing ! the wine list was very accommodating to any one 's taste.we ended closing the restaurant after our 2 delicious desert we ordered and the extra one that alan surprised us ! 5 star all the way ! thanks alan !
american	attentive wait staff ; an unusual combination . more specifically , the oysters were good but not quite cold enough . the production of amuse bouche was a nice touch . the roasted beets were well done . the charcuterie had bologna with american mustard , which took us by surprise . the albacore tuna , although expensive was lovely and we didn 't believe that the mushroom carbonara would top it , but it did . we also liked our side order of fries . food total was around $ 50 per head including tax .
american	we were served drinks immediately . the menu is not extensive but there is a lot of options regardless . the staff was very friendly , the washrooms are well kept , the food was good . the baklava was awesome . no complaints . : )
american	the place is classy , elegant and sophisticated . i ordered the grilled octopus and a salad.i really enjoyed the octopus , cooked and seasoned perfectly ! i had a couple of drinks off the drink menu and they were good too . my favorite part of the meal , my absolute favorite was the rosemary infused chocolate milk at the end . omg . that was so good ! the food was great , the drinks were tasty and the company was fantastic . the service was top notch . all in all , a wonderful night . i look forward to coming back .
american	open 24 hrs and was amazing . i ordered the chipotle / avocado burger with cheese , crispy fries , and thousand island sauce . also ordered the dux burger , classic american style . both burgers tasted like 80 / 20 meat to fat so amazing sear and crispiness . both came out to $ 28.00
american	they have a pretty cool setup for the first two true days of the tournament ( thursday / friday ) . we sat on the couches for both days with unlimited food from a buffet and unlimited well drinks and beer for a very reasonable price . lots of large televisions and access to the patio outside . we have been for a light dinner as well , happy hour is a great deal ! the pretzels are enormous and the drinks are great .
american	the service was great and the food was amazing .... i had the cheeseburger sliders and tastes of the chili tots . so good ! ! plus , their happy hour specials are really great too ! i highly recommend : )
american	it was 30 min later than we were promised , but the management kept us in the loop . we had pre ordered from their menu for large parties , so no surprises for wait staff . food was plentiful and hot , though a lil slow in coming out ... 45 min between salad and pasta . they forgot lil things like bread and salt and pepper but we were a large noisy group . food was ok . service ok . but the fact we all sat together and no issues with ordering and all food came out together for whole group ( 40 people ) priceless .
american	the sunday night pasta is great ! we had the buffet breakfast and found it to be a reasonable price compared to the other buffets that cost more and offer way too much food . it is open late which is a plus . we looked all over the wynn and encore for someplace to eat and nothing was open late .
american	the venue is nothing to brag about so it 's hard to bring guests from out of town here . the bottled soda selection will spin your head trying to select so hopefully you have an idea before going in .
american	on a slow sunday morning i came in for breakfast before my flight . the staff was nice and i was served right away . i had orange juice and the hearth benedict . i was told everything was is made fresh here and nothing out of a box , my meal was consistent with this so that 's good . it wasn 't the greatest eggs benedict i 've ever had but it wasn 't bad . the bread under the eggs was a fresh piece of thick bread but i would have preferred english muffins and the potato wedges were extremely soft . as a whole it 's a great place to have a meal in an airport where the food is fresh .
american	all kinds of age groups , families , couples , etc. filled the space and the open air kitchen added to the frenetic pace of the place . we ordered an assortment of breakfast dishes , but i only tasted my own dish . i ordered a traditional eggs benedict and it was cooked to perfection . the canadian version of hollandaise sauce is so rich and creamy , and theirs did not disappoint . the dish was served with lyonnaise style potatoes which were also crisp and delicious . a very satisfying meal .
american	really enjoyed our first visit , plan to return .
american	the service is never stellar , but it 's normally okay and we 're never in a hurry when we go there , so it 's not a big deal . sometimes , the wait staff gets confused if you properly pronounce beers , so using the local ( read : incorrect ) pronunciation might work better for you if it 's a fancy beer .
american	sorta like a trendy gastropub set up inside a fireman 's carnival . it was the fun stuff on the menu like lobster corn dogs that drew me to choose the place but in the end , i got a totally adult entree of duck breast , brussel sprouts , and " black risotto . " very good all around . friends with burgers were equally pleased as was the weirdo with the salad . amuse bouche of bacon and cheese-sprinkled tater tots was appreciated for both flavor and irony .
american	it made me indecisive ! cute atmosphere as well . i 'm sure i 'll be back when i 'm in the area .
american	finally , a place that can really brew tea ! the earl grey iced is luxurious ! truly a tea drinker 's delight !
american	i 've posted pictures of the crab legs and they were easily to eat since they were cut in half for the guests to grab the meat out with ease . i ate so much crab meat that i started getting sick of crab legs ( always a plus ! ) the server was very helpful and polite . she refilled our drinks and checked on us when it was necessary . the whole experience was excellent and thankful that it was a day like crab legs night . all i wanted was crab legs , therefore , i was completely satisfied .
american	you will eat a lot . don 't forget to ask them to steam them for you . trust me on this , you can eat twice as much if it 's warm and right . desserts- excellent . they taste as pretty as they look , which is rare . said to be made by jean-phillipe or someone who has an attractive bakery within the hotel as well . prime rib- good . cooked perfectly to taste perfect . service- waiter wasn 't so friendly , but i guess he got the job done ? hint : alaskan king crab legs only for weekday and weekend dinners . jumbo snow crab legs served during both .
american	i ate there just 3 times and the food was excellent on each occasion . i just tried out its replacment , the marrakesh , and it was a disappointment . food quality nowhere near the shish .
american	gyros and paninis very good , the feta cheese and olives came with a side of pita which was a looooot of food in the end . israeli salad was pretty good , similar to what i had in israel but smaller portions . nice little find ! thanks to yelp for hooking us up with the free baklava deal too : )
american	what a great decision . the highlights included the bamboozled shakes and the great service provided by allison . if you are looking for yummy burgers and delicate shakes and don 't want to break the bank check this place out b
american	i had the 16 spice chicken salad . it had perfectly grilled chicken , goat cheese , and delectable spices ! everyone else liked what they had too . and the coffee was so good ! they give you free bread , such as blue cornbread muffins and jalapeno scones . i greatly enjoyed this place !
american	plan to spend some time over dinner . chat with the waiter . feel like you are having diner in old school vegas . fixed price menu and the food was very good . i will be back ....
american	food is delicious and you will never leave hungry ! a regular favorite is the bugsy siegel omelet - definitely need to try it ! it may not be new or shiny , but it is too good to pass up .
american	this place defines las vegas . there something here for everyone . drinks , good food , and a excellent atmosphere . they have a huge cocktail menu , with just about any drink you can think of . there fireside lounge is what they are known for , its a comfortable setting with purple velvet booths and big screen tvs . the menu is just as big serving classic diner comfort food . great staff always friendly , and never had a bad meal here . the prices are very reasonable too , and you never leave hungry .
american	me and the cuz have to have fatburger at some point between midnight and 5am during every vegas trip ( no exceptions ) . it 's interesting just to people watch and see who comes in at those hours . i 'm a fan of the fatburger and fat fries ... but they have skinny fries as well . i 'm pretty simple at that time in the morning / night . they really have revamped this place ... the outside is a nice lounge-y area now and they have a slushi bar that i haven 't tried yet ( definitely going to next time ) .
american	post-brownie sundae , bestie 's baby to-be kicked . i think it was the hot fudge .
american	their portions are large but i wouldn 't call them generous considering the price , you 're looking at around $ 20 per person if you get a drink but it 's not a huge gouge as you will usually get bread and side salad included with your entree as well . they usually take five to ten to prepare an order but things can get crazy during busy times with lines that go out the door . overall a good spot once and a while and a must for late night munchies or after bar twilight meals . i personally love the chicken souvlaki .
american	i 've driven by this place several times without ever venturing in . i went with several friends last night and loved it . wasn 't super busy and the bartender was efficient . low key and super friendly patrons . try a shot of jameson with pickle juice ! yummy combo .
american	i had the two pieces of grilled chicken with jack daniels , broccoli , and sweet potato fries . the broccoli was crunchy to the bite and the sweet potato fries were well seasoned . the grilled chicken looked wonderful and it was pretty juicy on the inside as well . the jack daniels sauce tied the whole meal together and was a good size meal as well . the waitress was also friendly and quick . good place to come if you want some late night good food .
american	we took advantage of yelp 's burger binge event and tried their $ 14 burger for only $ 5 . all really , really good burger that is worth the regularly steep price but we made out like bandits that day .
american	i first gave senator a try when a close friend of mine vouched for her favorite brunch place in toronto . i ordered blueberry pancakes but i was served regular pancakes instead . the server was very apologetic and when the bill came i was expecting nothing more than an adjustment to my bill . to my surprise , the server gave me 50 % off my meal for the mix-up ! he was obviously not obligated to but it was really kind of him , and subsequently the restaurant , to provide such superb service ! the pancakes were delicious btw - will be coming back !
american	the portions were generous , especially considering the prices . the wait was a bit long , and the place was packed , but the wait wasn 't unreasonable . the food did take a bit longer than expected to arrive , but was fresh and hot when it did come . the cofee wasn 't bad , a tad on the weak side , as most diner coffee is . we left the table fully satisfied .
american	i ordered the pressed cuban and it did not disappoint . my wife ordered the roasted pork shoulder , the pork was crazy tender . my daughter had the pulled pork sandwich , it was delicious . my son had the cordon bleu sandwich and it was delicious as well . the portions are large and the service was nice and efficient . drove an hour to come here and it was worth it .
american	i mainly get the wreck with mayo , mustard , hot peppers and a pickle . add a side of jalepeno kettle chips and it 's a nice meal . it doesn 't fill me up , but sure tastes good .
american	he corrected our reservations issue . the food was excellent at the hotel restaurant for lunch . marcus was our waiter and was very helpful
american	i would recommend anyone to have a late night snack and drink , great prices ! thanks albert ! : )
american	the seasoning was pretty good and spicy . the crawfish were a little small . service was really really friendly and inviting .
american	al & b 's is located in the old location of sirus pizza.dont expect to find all kinds of neat décor because this is a hood bbq joint but its very good.i had a rib dinner with peach cobbler and it ran me a total of 12 bucks.the food comes out hot and the meat isn 't drenched in sauce.the service is good so yall go out and give al & b 's a try .
american	the boneless ribs were unbelievably good ! i recommend a double helping of the best baked beans ever ! the beans were loaded with meat and cooked just right . if you are from boston and think your mama makes good boston baked beans then don 't tell her how good these are . it will hurt her feelings ! good job al !
american	who knew this jumping little place would spring forth from the ruins of wonder 's ? y 'all are going into your 3rd year of blissful success and i couldn 't be prouder . keep on keeping on with your sweet potato fries with the jam ( and they are the jam ) , your rotating beers on tap , your salsa , burgers and your live and free @ alchemy shows . i love you , alchemy . i really effing do . cheers !
american	they have a really great selection of beers that changes all the time , and i would argue one of the best friday fish fries in madison . the menu is casual , but everything is really delicious . the bison burger never disappoints , the sweet potato fries are killer ( raspberry jalapeno jam dip is freaking amazing ) , the chicken wings are enormous , and the wasabi green beans are a kickass side . don 't accept credit cards , so bring cash . waitstaff are always great and super attentive , but it gets busy and fills up fast , so get there early or be prepared to have a drink at the bar while you wait .
american	great views , great food and lots of good service . it is especally lovely when there is a full moon rising over the mountains . its a little expensive but you can catch happy hour wine and hordourves in the bar and balcony area . i like that they are so happy to see you , very gracious appreciative of their customers .
american	they have an excellent rotating tap selection and the food is local , delicious and cheap ! whenever possible , try the specials , especially the batch bread plate of the day ! my only complaint is that when they do friday fish fry , they don 't offer their amazing sweet potato fries . also lots of great vegetarian options , which makes me very happy . i recommend the matilda sandwich , the maize salad , and my husband recommends the tin shack smokehouse burger . the service is generally good , but sometimes leaves something to be desired . also expect a wait if you go out after 6pm on weekends and many weekdays .
american	it 's a great neighborhood place to hang with friends . their tap list is short but consistently good . the food is of high quality , and executed well . i especially like the applerum burger ( with deluxe add-on ) .
american	the food is delicious ! i 've tried the butternut squash soup ( seasonal ) , butternut squash sandwich , wasabi green beans ( yum ! ) , sweet potato chips , portabella pate with grilled bread ( unique , vegetarian , and yummy ! ) . all food is delish ! ! ! ! they have fun coctails at decent prices , too , such as the philosopher 's stone ( run with ginger beer ) and awesome old fashions . four stars because seating can be a challenge at times , especially if you have more than 4 people in your party .
american	thoroughly enjoyed my brunch here despite having to wait a bit before getting a seat . this place is self serve in terms of seating . i tried the eggs benny with the peameal bacon , spinach and avocado spread and it was delicious ! the egg was very well and the dish was very satisfying with the accompanying salad and home fries . i also had their chai tea latte which was nice and foamy and also pretty good . the parking in this plaza is also very limited so it can be tough at peak times to dine here .
american	the food is inventive , locally inspired , and well prepared . i 've never had a bad meal here . all sandwiches are tasty , including the vegetarian options , and i love that i can pair them with the always high quality / fresh / more-than-your-average-side-salad " salad of the day . " over the years i 've tried a few of the specials ( pulled pork nachos and tilapia dinner come to mind ) and they have not disappointed ! oh yeah , i should forget to mention the midwest-centric craft beer on tap . be prepared to wait on a weekend evening and bring cash . it 'll be worth it .
american	ya they are $ 18 but they are hefty and delicious ! i tried the georgia peach and whiskey girl and they were both very good ! and to top it off if you don 't finish it they will give you a to-go cup ! ! ! only in vegas : ) food is a little over-priced for what you get , in my opinion , but still it was good . our waitress was super nice and pretty , you don 't get that very often ~ so needless to say we were thankful . i am not a fan of country , at all- but my friends are , either way i enjoyed coming here for dinner then leaving : )
american	i had the hopalicous and the teipel nova , both great beers . had a cup of beer cheese soup that was just a amazing . being in wisconsin and at a brewery , you do the math ... plus with the added kielbasa ... but i digress ... definitely worth checking out if your in the area . great solo or if your bringing the folks from work with you .
american	well let me say that in hindsight i am not disappointed we had to go here . i enjoyed a flight of beers with my husband . the hopalicious is one of my favorites ! for lunch i had the spicy peanut salad with chicken . the flavors were great and i felt like i got a good portion ! plus it evened out the beer i was drinking nicely . the flavors in the salad were good although i could have gone for more " spice " in my spicy peanut sauce ! the tasting room was pretty empty while we were here . we came with a big group and had no problem getting a table and our server was great !
american	it 's all things balls , even in limited time gyro disguise ( assuming one opts for the grinder ) . there 's a ball for everyone - choose wisely . the parmesan broccoli is a great healthy side full o ' flavor , but who are we kidding people ... whet your appetite with the pepperoni fritters served w / their almost famous tangy marinara sauce . then , wash it all down with one of the their many craft beers - roughly 30 taps at your disposal . emporio 's strip mall location in wexford loses some of its appeal compared to the o.g. downtown location , but if you 're looking to mix things up go ' head and check it out .
american	he made recommendations that were spot on ! i had the carnitas hash -fantastic ! my hubby had the flat iron steak hash and loved it ! we 'll be back on our next visit to scottsdale !
american	picture this . a sandwich with tomatoes , fries , coleslaw and your favorite choice of meat . choose from ham , turkey , roast beef , chicken or from one of the countless sandwich choices on the menu . my favorite is the steak and cheese . this is definitely a spot to hit up when you 're in the ' burgh , you won 't be disappointed .
american	excellent pricing , excellent food , and the best value for the money anywhere . come early and take advantage of the ridiculous breakfast deals . this place is as good as it gets .... literally .
american	she took great care of us . i could see her scan her tables on each trip in and out of the kitchen so she saw instantly when we needed more drinks and brought them and when the check was ready . we 've always enjoyed fd 's ribs but last night we tried the brisket and chopped pork sandwiches and they were delish . and we love the pickles and chips !
american	great food , great drink choices ( 3 kinds of sweet tea ) , and a few tvs with games on . great , clean atmosphere . the reason i gave it 4 stars is because chicken tenders aren 't the best they could be and the lemonade is a bit sour and of the two times i have been in they have been almost out of it . still a little bit pricey , but not too bad . family of 4 is looking at paying about $ 31 . i recommend this place if you want to try something new .
american	the pasta is very very good ( i 'm italian , so don 't say this lightly ) and the chicken alle erbe is also very very good : it is served with a sauce that has sage , basil and other herbs - delicious ! the wine selection suits the dishes they are meant to accompany , and the desserts are great too ! john and his staff are curteous and knowledgeable , so go dine at this gem of a restaurant ... you will not regret it try anything on the menu and you will be glad you came in !
american	the baby apple pancake came out piping hot and delicious and the omelets are soooo fluffy ! i don 't even understand how they get them so light and airy ! i really liked the food , even the cinnamon raisin toast came out hot and sliced thick . i like all the orange trees , i 'm guessing they are fake but i 'll investigate more next time . this could get five stars from me but they played 4 , count them , four nickelback songs in the time that i was dining , which was just way too much whiny sadness for my pancake feast .
american	both awesome people . alexa is super cute and that doesn 't hurt a bit . i use this place like my office regularly . i enjoy the coffee and the food very much . cheat day wrap and hot sauce all day !
american	all of the food was excellent , the best texas bbq i 've had in years ... besides my own ! ! ! !
american	it has great food and a cozy atmosphere within the heart of charlotte 's oldest neighborhoods .
american	the aesthetic feel is very homey , and the service is excellent . i have never been disappointed with anything i have ordered alexander michael 's . i would recommend the pasta dishes , burgers , london broil sandwich , wings , and jerk chicken quesadillas . the pricing is very reasonable as well . do yourself a favor and dine at alexander michael 's .
american	she 's great .. everything came out perfect and we never asked or waited for anything . love the filet here : )
american	we were seated outdoors on the sidewalk under the awning for dinner on 23 july 2014 . the waitress was very polite yet efficient with her duties . i had a glass of moet and a classic caesar salad . my darling had a croque monsieur with a green salad . it was absolutely charming . my salad was exquisitely flavored and was really something special . the salty , nutty parmesan cheese shaved on top was a real treat . the sandwich was classically prepared and equally delicious ! although very pricey , this place is worth it !
american	great attitude and personality . love that you changed up the music and are now playing more modern songs and the new specials . only thing we miss is the omb draft friday night special .
american	breakfast was delicious . definitely worth the wait . omelettes are huge , corned beef hash amazing , and biscuits and gravy delish . somewhere off the vegas strip where the locals eat . not a bad place to be !
american	the food was absolutely amazing ! 10 / 10 would come here again . huge portions and extremely good ! ! !
american	great food ! we 'll be back again ! ! ! ! ! she suggested the cobb salad and kale salad , both were amazing !
american	alex from sonics is on point , she did four separate orders for my friends and i super quick and her eyeliner was on fleek .
american	the food is delicious and the experience is great ! ! ! he was very attentive . even when they ran out of key lime cheesecake he made sure to get the key lime drizzle for us ! the food was amazing , the service was phenomenal and the atmosphere was perfect ! can 't wait to come back ! ask for alex ! ! ! p.s. so they ran out of key lime cheesecake but alex made sure to put some key lime drizzle on our plate with our regular cheesecake . he really paid attention to detail and made sure our first trip to vegas was special !
american	he took the time to explain all of the options to us and made sure we had a positive experience entering and leaving the sub shop . we would come back again because of the hospitality alex has shown !
american	she is the reason for this five-star review . personable , engaging , knowledgeable , and efficient - those all describe alex and the service we received from alex . generally this is a well-maintained and nice red robin ( can 't say that for all of them ) . we are usually greeted immediately and there 's never too long of a wait to be seated . food is good and quality is consistent from visit to visit .
american	he made our experience the best it possibly could be . i 've never had more personable service anywhere else . kaleb was very attentive . i think i 'm in love with the euro burger !
american	everybody loved their food and most went back for seconds and thirds . they were on time for everything , very attentive , and a pleasure to work with .
american	he made up a sandwich platter for our bosses birthday . it was a hugh hit ! ! thank you alex for all the extras !
american	had margarita pizza , asparagus arugura salad and chicken caesar salad . good lunch .
american	i have been to alex a couple of times and they never disappoint . i typically go with their tasting menu that changes from season to season . one of my favorite dishes is their foie gras . it is one of the largest , most tender examples i have had since my trip to paris . the decor is over the top vegas , but so fitting at the wynn . the service is top notch and make sure to spend some time with the sommelier , especially if you love wine and champagne .
american	my kids love wing night . wings are also amazing . the beer is just an extra added bonus .
american	he is very funny and a great server . i enjoy his company . and .... hes good looking ladies .... thanks alex again for a great time .
american	you can 't go wrong with anything you order one of my favorite restaurants in vegas period
american	he started out by taking a group photo then recommended three entrees ( chilean sea bass / rib eye strips / filet mignon with mushrooms ) and four sides ( asparagus with lemon sauce / grilled brussels sprouts / au gratin potatoes / macaroni cheese with lobster ) for six of us to share . perfect amount of food . then the desserts--creme brulee with berries , cheesecake with berries , double chocolate cake with soaked cherries , and the best : coconut cream pie with caramel syrup . amazing food for $ 46 .
american	alex o the casher provide amazing service would highly recommend coming here ask for alex he will treat well with respect and a smile
american	the blackened alligator tail was very tasty . the fried oysters were seasoned well . the brought bread ( 2 rolls from albertsons ) and hush puppies neither were worth the calories . had blackened catfish and shrimp great meal , nice portions . all the entrees were good .
american	the brunch selection and the bottomless bloody mary 's were the bomb .
american	omg the tri-tip and lamb are my favorites . the garlic filet mignon came 2nd . we tried this in the nevada branch in the miracle mile shopping center . don 't fill up on the salad bar ; try a taste each of the 12 meats and concentrate on eating more of your favorites . splendid tasting experience !
american	really passionate about the craft . he made my toronto trip the best by suggesting all the cool hip things to do it town . not only are the drinks good , the food is great too . come on in an sit at the bar with your noms and enjoy a hand crafted whiskey cocktail with the beautiful alex !
american	it 's always nice to meet the head chef and owner of a place ! he was very nice and gave us an order of bbq sausage on the house . the food is fantastic ! the sides are so good we can never decide which 3 to get for the sampler . it 's so much food but it 's so good you can 't stop eating . cool vibe , great service and even better food . highly recommend !
american	he was friendly , courteous , and helpful . i called to inform his manager , rainbow , of his accomplishments , but she was less than enthusiastic . i would absolutely compliment alex , but not so much rainbow . rainbow sucks .
american	very nice and took our order with ease . food was great especially the southwestern egg rolls ! : - )
american	alex the waiter is as good as my tri tip steak excellent service without the big o in the wallet
american	made us feel at home in a concrete city and the food was great ! ! would go again ! ! !
american	service was outstanding . i love when restaurants give you gifts to remember them . we got a box of macaroons from alex . our server was great , very professional but also personable , which is important to me . i don 't like being served by a robot . the food was excellent ! my lamb was cooked perfectly , the turbot was good too ! and the risotto was stellar ! the restaurant ambiance was a bit too formal in masculine decor for my personal tastes , but nonetheless , stunning .
american	i couldn 't believe how amazing my experience was today with him . request to talk to alex !
american	we loved dinning here because of her sweet attitude and effort as our server . will come back and would definitely recommend ! food was excellent as well ! try the wings
american	we had the sage chicken eggs benedict as featured on man vs food . holy shit it was good . mother in law had the banana french toast . she loved it . come here ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
american	the food tasted great and the team was experienced and professional . they dressed the tables , oredered the silverware , and cleaned up afterwards . my guests favorite dish was the stuffed shells . we also had plated salads , london broil , and chicken fontini . the crew was flexible and cut and plated our wedding cake on the fly .
american	the restaurant existed before the holiday inn in which it is housed . so this is definitely not your usual motel restaurant . the menu includes polenta fries , tripe , and swiss chard patties in addition to other italian standards like gnocchi and chicken parmesan . we liked it so much we went back for dinner a second night . servers were good . as another reviewer noted , the place does get busy , so service may be slow . the food more than made up for it . next time we 're in mayfield , we 'll be back .
american	the salmon was awesome ! seared tuna salad incredible ! the burger actually came medium full of flavor ! and the fruit pancakes out of this world !
american	but what makes algebra so special is that nearly everything in the restaurant is made by the owner . and i 'm not just talking about from-scratch entrees . i mean the tables , the plates and cups , the window sills ! talk about homey . this is it .
american	can eat there too ! killer place above the street to catch the sunset , and happy hour .
american	i 've never been to a middle eastern restaurant with such authentic syrian food . the shiska bob is to die for and the falafal is absolutely delicious , and i love how they give you a salad with your meal , and the hummus is delicious too . very tasty tempting food and very filling . i think everyone should try it !
american	sure , it 's a little cheesy and over the top , but that 's part of the fun . i went with my dad the other day for lunch and we had a very pleasant experience . i ordered the turkey burger , which was topped with swiss cheese and portabello mushrooms . it was quite tasty . no complaints ; i would definitely go back .
american	" the concept is a bizarre combo of alice cooper and a sports bar - and it works . we stopped by two other places to check out their menus before a game , and they didn 't look very thrilling . the menu at cooperstown is pretty extensive - lots of options . the service was very quick and efficient . i see no reason to go anywhere else before a d-backs game .
american	hope to give those fries again on my next trip to pittsburgh : )
american	each course was divine ! ! i 'm not vegetarian and i loved the fried brussel sprouts ! ! delicious . you can 't miss with this place .
american	their menu is diverse , their prices are competitive , and their service ( professional , friendly and knowledgeable ) is a + . reliability and timeliness are unmatched . their flavors are always tasty and range from comfort-food favorites to new and exotic ; always fresh ingredients . i cannot wait to see what is on the next menu !
american	made our experience at aliante great . she checked on me and my friend multiple times , even thought it was past 2 am .
american	loved this coffeehouse / cafe since working at what used to be the brewery , next door to them . the alien wrap is a meat free wrap that fills you up and just makes you feel good afterward ! definitely recommend this place and the mint mocha as well ! excellent staff , quaint space with a cute patio . perfect for easy sunday mornings or any morning for that matter !
american	a lil $ $ but it seemes all subs shops are getting there .
american	i also sampled the chicken wings with there many variations of sauces ( tie sauce is my fav ) def will be returning
american	some of the best fried chicken that i have ever eaten . their burgers are juicy and melt of the top softness . be prepared to be standing outside waiting for your order as the place is tiny . next purchase is going to the ribs . looks amazing ! !
american	but honestly for the price u are getting quality food in large portions . sage fried chicken with spinach is amazing , my gf had the mushroom hash with scrambled eggs . check it out ! !
american	food is absolutely delicious and worth every penny . food taste fresh . top 5 breakfast spot i 've ever been to . would have to come try out there lunch . oh what did i get . the green chile flannel . i believe that was the name of it . my friend got the french toast . had a taste of that 2 . once again delicious . real fruits . not that cheap stuff everyone else has . eggs taste farm fresh . need i say more .....
american	alil pricey for the location but completly get the bang for your buck sweet fries on point 100 %
american	since i collect pint glasses and brewery tee shirts , i had to give chicago beer company a try . my husband is a wine lover , we were happy to see that they had his wine of choice ! since it is located in the four queens casino , i was happy to see that smoking and non-smoking sections were in two separate sections . the bartenders were helpful and knowledgeable when advising me on beer choices ! i am glad that i gave it a try !
american	the sandwiches are what sandwiches should be . the rosemary fries are excellent ; be sure to try them with shasha sauce . if you 're looking for a spot for a quick " b , " this is it .
american	it 's a quick-fix solution for when you 're urgently in need of some tasty arab food . beef is a bit dry , chicken shawarma is decent but the chicken shish tawook is awesome . made from chicken breast it 's skewered chicken breast ( like souvlaki ) tossed onto a fresh pita with your choice of fillings . want more chicken ? try the ali 's half chicken dinner and get 2 legs of chicken on a bed of rice with salad for like $ 8 . with a little side of hummus and that killer garlic sauce is mmm mmm good . not recommended before a date though . ( garlic )
american	the brisket is amazing , well everything is amazing . mr.allison is a top notch texan , extremely polite and very passionate about his food . family owned business who actually cares about the customers . my wife came in to grab some dinner and we were both extremely happy . thank you allison family we will be back
american	the meat was tender and the whole grain mustard gave the sandwich a different kick from your typical cuban sandwich . red velvet cookie sandwich was also delicious and fresh . be prepared to wait in a little bit of a line around lunch time though and seating is sparse . good for carry out if you have the time to spare during your lunch break .
american	so i have a decent grasp on the food scene and where to and not to go . recently i visited friends after graduating , and i lost my wallet . after being wired some cash , i was dragged to brunch . little did i know that it would be worth spending half of all ( $ 45 ) i had to eat here . the views , the food , the unrivaled ambiance . w-o-w . did not know anything resembling this place was anywhere near cleveland . only excuse for not going here is that you 're in jail or dead .
american	but wanting a steak and not wanting to break the bank we decided to give it another try . our waiter , eddie gave us impeccable service , he was attentive and entertaining . our food was also very good . good job outback !
american	i like the new additions to the menu and they have really stepped it up with the new burger options they have . a good spot to stop by for a burger and beer . we will visit this location again in the future .
american	i had the hot n juicy special crawfish , medium heat . i pretty much inhaled it . the sweet potato fries were made perfect . i cant wait to come back for more !
american	breakfast 24 / 7 . think good greasy spoon ! ! !
american	great , typical , greasy spoon diner . always give the special a shot .
american	daniel was our server-and what a delight he was ! he offered input on our selections and he was spot on . my friend and i split a whole rotisserie chicken with 2 sides , coleslaw and the caesar , and the jalapeno pesto and umami sauces . chicken was tender and the zippy side sauces added a nice punch . the coleslaw and salad added a much needed crunchy complement . we got there as it opened and were seated immediately . in a matter of minutes the restaurant was hopping . our service was nicely paced-and daniel made our day with his hospitality and charm ! ask for him- he is something to crow about !
american	so i walked 45 mins from flamingo to aria . i ordered one of their recommended items : the ultimate omelette . it came with shrimp and goat cheese . to my throbbing brain , both of those sounded good . the food came out quickly , and i was very happy with my egg white and fresh fruit substitutions at no upcharge , but i quickly verified that imho , shrimp / egg / cheese is not a good combo . service was ok and it was of course expensive ( $ 20 just for the omelette ) . typical vegas style . if i were staying at aria i would eat here again . otherwise i 'll stick to something closer to home base .
american	staff wasn 't super quick at making my food but it wasn 't slow enough to become annoying . although the upgrade to onion rings normally results in less bang for your buck i was pleasantly surprise with the amount of rings i got . yummy
american	the potato skins are also really really good . service was excellent as well , you just have to realize it is mainly a bar-but don 't let that scare you away ! !
american	good menu with lots of options . we went in the afternoon and it was not very busy , but i 'm sure they get a good lunch pop with all the businesses in the area .
american	first breakfast stop on the trip and may be back again . seems like a lot of regulars and taxi drivers so if this is their spot , it 's good enough for me .
american	but nice , salt-of-the-earth people serving and cooking . my old school pepperoni and mushroom pizza was great . good ingredients , well prepared and fair price . i 'll be back .
american	they serve their version of the bloomin onion was now $ 5 . just as good quality as the name brand for reasonable price . we told them we were new customers and the manager owner came out to greet us . if the whole chain is like this restaurant a great value and an overall pleasant casual dining experience . the catfish was hand breaded . nice touch !
american	i had the chicken-articoke stack , and it was amazing ! ! always great food and great service .
american	the meat lovers omelet with a side of feta cheese . the flavor was amazing . don 't be fools by the outside or the barrish ambiance . this place serves a great breakfast !
american	the waiter is very friendly . i made a mistake on my order and they fixed it right away . i offered to pay for it and they insisted that i didn 't have to . i must say i will be back again . i 've been here many of tines but i forget to check in and leave a post . well this time they earned it and want to say thank you for your professional crew . i will come back with my family again .
american	the 1 / 2 char broiled angus burger is great . they cook the burger to your preference and it turns out better than expected . i got the burger on a sesame seed bun and all the toppings . i added " maytag blue cheese and bacon for something different and wow , what a taste . the fries and onion strings come in a minature fry basket which looks cool too . for dessert , get the deep fried twinkie , if you dare , ha . i also tried the giant bacon wrapped dog and the house chili and i have to tell ya , for casino food , i was impressed .
american	the spirit and flavor of authentic louisiana . the owner , gwen is a gem who goes above and beyond for each customer . all cajuns know- the po-boy is all about the bread : ) . streetcar po-boys won 't disappoint ! ! !
american	i dig it . i will always love this place no matter where the location ( ny , pa or vegas ) .
american	i love everything ... unfortunately today was a different story , waited approximately 50 minutes for salad , got home and realize it wasn 't anything that i requested
american	slight wait due to the cozy size . phenomenal servers dressed in pajamas ; awesome french pressed coffee and the food exceeded expectations . bucket list material !
american	it is about the same as any other wing place around so nothing special and not anymore overpriced than buffalo wild wings .
american	a little bit pricey for the food however the ambiance was good and the quality was great loved the risotto .
american	the salad and soup bar was out when we arrived at 7 : 20 , but the hot bar ( with the carribean bowl that i had been wanting to try ! ) closes at 7 . nothing a couple wine tastings upstairs couldn 't fix ! and another heads up , those shut down at 8 : 30 . i do appreciate the special wine sections upstairs ( i 'm talking about the " recommended under $ 10 section , you know me too well ! ) now if i could only find a way to keep my fiance from getting 2lbs of the salad bar everytime we go , there 's just too many awesome options , all ingredients labeled and vegan items clearly marked !
american	staff greets you as you walk in , food is good . one of the new fancy soda machines that have many different types and flavors .
american	oh and michael irvin was at the table next to us !
american	the food is exceeds my expectation . we had cream-legume soup to start , artichoke and heart-of-palm salad , a block ( deep fried pastry stuffed with tofu spinach and cheese ) as the appetizer , and cous-cous royal and vegetarian for the main course . bread was fresh baked and served warm . the stewed lamb was so tender and the grilled chicken was delicious . absolutely a delight dinner on a cold winter night .
american	they have a decent wine list and food is usually very good . some occasional hiccups keep this from receiving 5 stars but all in all this is a good safe bet .
american	a little crowded at lunch ( obviously ) , but excellent waitressing , a monster sandwich , and a great selection of beer make the wait worthwhile .
american	the dude burger was perfectly cooked and super tasty .
american	as a native detroiter living in ca i make sure i hit up aci every time i head out to vegas . everyone is really friendly and the coneys , loose meats , and gyros are on spot ! met the owners a couple times and they are great ! i saw a few negative reviews and was pretty surprised . i 've been 20 + times and always had a stellar experience .
american	very unique modeled in peloponese style both in flavors and ambiance . outdoor patio will offer a more authentic experience and service here is exceptional . the lobster was perfect and the lemon oil garnish is to die for . the general manager jackie was very knowledgeable of the chef 's background as well as friendly and welcoming . milos special is also a must with a side of skordalia . if you are looking for traditional greek food this is probably not for you but if you are a greek looking for an innovative approach to your authentic old country favorite , this place will exceed your expectations .
american	the owner carmello was friendly and efficient . our party had salads and sandwiches and everyone was happy . go through the north door after parking in the back .
american	but the chicken gyro is great ! soft flatbread ( and a little sweet ? i like it ) , delicious chicken , good price . a little bit large , haha . the service is good , too .
american	fantastic service , delicious food . i had the french toast with caramel and pecans , my mom had the pumpkin pancakes and my aunt the chicken fried steak . everything was delicious , the coffee was worth the price , and they weren 't stingy with the refills either . definitely will keep going back .
american	i like the salmon patties and the pot roast dinners . they give generous sides like sweet potatoes , all cinnamon and buttery . their drink specials are generous--i 've tried the margarita and long island iced tea and enjoyed the refreshing cocktails . their deviled eggs are awesome and come with every meal . with a sweet little patio , friendly servers and a cheery decor this place makes me smile .
american	i wasn 't too sure what to expect . i was hoping for a fun place to hang out with my adult friends . this place is full of teenagers and kids . helped us feel young again . movie was good for the price .
american	some courses were great like the steak-cooked perfectly . i found other courses to be a too heavy . if you like rich food i would recommend . service was just ok . ambiance was good . drinks were great .
american	and worth every bite . tender , juicy , and i never can eat all of it , so makes great leftovers .
american	food is pretty decent and a good selection of beers . what 's not to like ?
american	$ 42.00 for a 10 " with two sodas . the ingredients were high end delicious . awesome pizza . the service was impressive .
american	i really enjoyed the high ceilings in the restaurant . my favorite part of the meal was the fattouche salad . it wasn 't too salty or sour , just perfect . we tried the shish kebab filet mignon , the sea bass and the sole filet . the first two dishes were the best . the desserts were nice , but not too memorable . we had gone with expectations of a very slow service , but it turned out that it was fairly fast despite the restaurant being full . i would return again . it also has a room in the back that could accommodate up to 20-25 people .
american	fun , local versions of southern lunch and dinner items . friendly , informative , non-rushed waitstaff make it a pleasure to view the menu and enjoy the meal .
american	servers were friendly and service was fast ! we 'll be back r
american	stuffed banana peppers were amazing ! salad was average . margherita pizza not as good as i expected .
american	mmmm .... the super clucker and great gobbler are delicious as well . the fries are seasoned perfectly . not sure what a child could order except the chicken finger meal . the owner will make sure everything is perfect when he 's there , otherwise check your order . small , only 6 tables inside , drive thru , small parking lot . no vegetarian choices , they do offer desserts , ask when you order a drink , some come in cans . : /
american	i could eat jim 's dogs with sauce and cheese all day every day .
american	booths are a little small and uncomfortable . wait staff is always friendly and competent , and i 'd say about 70 % of the female staff is hot . it makes the food taste that much better !
american	we come here every time we have out of town guest . the food and service is always excellent and my guest have never been disappointed .
american	the food is amazing and seems like every part of the meal is prepared with care . i 've personally never had a problem being seated quickly , even in their busiest hours . our waitress was attentive and once ordered , food came quickly . my glass was never completely empty and dishes were cleared in record time ! i never felt rushed to leave either . would definitely recommend especially if you are new to the area .
american	the food tastes great and they offer great salads and sandwiches . their dessert bars are awesome and big enough to share easily with others . grilled cheese and tomato soup are the mainstays . this place does great with large group orders .
american	me and my gf both had steak , mine with lobster and it was cooked perfectly , but not really seasoned enough . the wait staff was excellent . my glass was never empty and i was checked on like 10 times . this would be a 5 star review if the $ 4 bloom petals didnt seem like the burnt scraps they fished out of the fryer or the steaks had some kind of garnesh besides just meat and potatoe on a plate ... presentatiom is everything guys , get with the program .
american	it was good food and i would definitely recommend it - especially if you are passing through the area like we were . very popular place ( based on the line that seemed to be replenished with new patrons about every 10 minutes ) , good and fast service but it 's not the best bbq i 've ever had fircthat price .
american	the day i arrived in vegas my uber driver shared that this bistro has the best steak and eggs that her husband had ever tasted . of course , i had to see for myself . it was fabulous ! i chose to sit outside to enjoy the morning sun , the view and people watching was ideal . the service was so friendly , helpful and polite . i did have to send one of the four eggs i ordered , over easy , back for being over done however , my meal was all that she claimed , so flavorful and everything else was cooked to perfection . my replacement egg arrived quickly and was exactly how i wanted it .
american	raspberry french toast , crab benny , guy 's omelet ... and more !
american	fresh ingredients , including fresh mozzarella ( you rarely find a place that uses fresh mozzarella ) . service was top notch . we went on a friday night with a large party and we were seated in less than 10 minutes with warm bread with olive oil and balsamic arrived before we could settle in . give it a try , you won 't be disappointed .
american	went there based on a recommendation . loved the menu , the service , the design ( great design ) and , yes , the food . waiter traded us up to " drunken bread . " yum ! fondue in a skillet ! we had the farm salad , incredibly fresh ! truffle mac . french onion soup smothered in grueyresalad . my husband is still raving about it . and , we arrived at 10 : 30pm . no one rushed us .
american	with just a few tables this place looks sparse and basic . some of the best chicken i 've had here in the us or abroad . take your pick from a wrap , salad , or bowl . the chicken istanbul mixed with mozzarella cheese and some kind of sweet red pepper sauce and is amazing ! ! the chicken troy wrap included another delicious chicken mix with grilled red peppers and onions inside a wrap with cracked wheat , lettuce and the complete fixins , and an little extra white bean salad . yummy ! very casual , fast food . we 'll be back !
american	menu choice very limited but i always order the same " surprise " brunch each and single time i go there .
american	in every cracker barrel , i have never once had bad wait staff . food is super inexpensive but i would really love to see some healthy options involved .
american	the staff is more amazing than the food and that is not an insult to the food but as a restaurant mangers view just as important . friendly- funny- upbeat . go early or you may have to wait outside . the word is out and its a 4 star place i will go back to .
american	but damn is it nicer than ever . great service . friendly knowledgeable servers . and the food is still tasty and the presentation is awesome . no complaints because we were seated quickly . our drinks came quickly and the server took our order quickly .
american	would definitely be back if we lived in az. also , large outdoor area - dog friendly !
american	i 've been several times , ordered both the bistecca and salmon and they have a decent selection of wine on tap . everything was delicious , however i do wish the salmon was a little larger or that it came with a little more something on the side . the first time i ordered the bistecca it came with these delicious brussel sprouts , however about a month later when i ordered the same bistecca i was given brussel sprout flakes ( ? ? ? ? ) which are not filling , kinda strange . however , the rest of the food , atmosphere , wine and staff have always made my visit good . p.s. try their little homemade donut dessert .... so yummy ! !
american	we got to sit at the bar , and just had raws . great suggestions for the shucker dude- was fun to watch him open , clean and present . he checks each oyster for smell and freshness and isn 't shy about ditching ones that don 't pass snuff . fresh ground horseradish , plus a few sauces if you fancy . kitchen menu looked pretty good too . definitely worth a visit .
american	the staff has a passion for excellence and it shows from the moment you walk in to the afterglow of a fantastic lunch . this time i did the chicago dog which is a snappy big guy with all the right ingredients . last time it was the italian melt on a roll with a ton of meat and that awesome mix of the italian dressing with the lettuce and tomatoes . don 't get me started on the service . simply world class . i would love to know how they get such a concentration of employees who care about the customer ! disney , hilton or any company or owner who cares about customers should come by with a notepad ( and an appetite ) .
american	service was good but not polished . the meatballs were perfect . very flavorful . sea scallops were delicious . ambience is nice but it 's more bustling than relaxing . italian birthday cake is something i 'd highly recommend if you 're in the mood for dessert . skip the drinks , they looked overpriced and sugary .
american	i liked the decor ; rustic , great tables that i expect were purpose built , lovely overhead lamps casting ' just right ' light . a simple seasonal four course menu , on the two courses that offered a choice , we made sure we didn 't duplicate . sustainable and local were paramount . service was outstanding : friendly , warm , knowledgable . good bread was always at the ready . the dishes were very good and well though out . all poutine heads ought to be introduced to the puree of smoked potatoes that coddled one of the mains . special kudos to the sommelier . her pairings were all a bit unusual and interesting .
american	suggestion to owners : add " next to tropical smoothie " in description . meal was excellent . got the traditional eggs benedict , and was relieved when it was traditional . too many places try to put their own mark on traditional benny , when all i want is the real deal . coffee is top notch , not always the case at breakfast places in vegas . i wanted to end with a little something sweet , not a full order of anything . they gladly served me a half order of french toast . good ending to relaxing brunch .
american	absolutely worth the effort though ! very unique selection , great scenery , and delicious food ! we had mimosa 's and the brunch pizza . very good ! mimosas were $ 7 each , pizza was $ 19 . check them out if you want some amazing food !
american	once i got inside the long line was seated quickly , within 5 minute ( on a sunday ) . the waitress cathy was super friendly and the rest of the staff was courteous , helpful and fast . the food was excellent . ( everyone gets banana nut bread ) i 'm glad i came hear . oh ya the price was more than half what i payed at the casino . i 'll be back next time i 'm in vegas .
american	never had mediterranean food before but was motivated by the other reviews and boy were they right ! order the cheese naan bread as a starter and had ranias special naanwhich and was not disappointed . it might not seem like a lot but it is definitely filling .
american	a little hidden gem in downtown chandler ... home cooking type comforting food for me and reminds me of mama 's sunday brunch cooking .
american	we have pasted this place several times and visited it on the food tour . what a pancake , raspberry and i am not a pancake fan , it was great . nice atmosphere and even nicer owners . we had a nice time and look forward to eating there again .
american	i went in and had a burger and it was really good . i will definitely be coming back when i 'm in the area for lunch .
american	the breakfast was plentiful and quite delicious . everyone seemed to know each other here and were very friendly . i highly recommend trying fixins for breakfast and or lunch . no dinner is served here .
american	would be great for date night and the prime rib melts in your mouth !
american	if you can get past how the place looks , the lack of upkeep , the dishes not being the cleanest , the not so fresh smell , and focus on the down home friendly service , low prices , always hot fresh flavorful food & the often unintentionally hilarious or odd show watching the locals , then this is your place . i 've never ventured off the breakfast menu , especially since they close at like 2p everyday or something . but when i go in for a late breakfast , many are eating lunch ( looks like dinner meals ) plates . now i think i 'll go by there this or tomorrow morning !
american	sedara and i got burgers and jessy got a mediterranean plate . the food came out quickly , was really good , generous portions , and dirt cheap . i 'm glad we stumbled across this place .
american	stopped by cuz i wanted a philly steak and this place did not disappoint me . the price are great took the lunch special u get a half philly steak a drink and fries for only 7 bucks that 's cheap for a lunch . try the parmesan fries they are delicous .
american	i 'm picky when it comes to my gyro and they made it just right for me . love the frozen glasses that they provide for your drinks . good food at a fair price .
american	since it was my first time i was a bit overwhelmed with the choices . one of the employees came out to chat with me and explain everything , which was a pretty big help . i got a sandwich - i can 't tell you what sandwich it was , but it was good . like really good . looking for a quick lunch , that is a little different and is tasty ? ike 's is a great place to go .
american	sub bread was fresh sesame seed bun . wings with perfect amount of sauce . nice casual lunch spot .
american	this pretty much sums of coronado cafe . i have been wanting to visit coronado cafe for quite awhile now and finally today was the day ! this little house also reminds me of a little elf 's cottage but in a really cute way . i like the food and atmosphere here . i tried the veggie wrap with chicken and it had a very delicious vinegar added to it . it was the perfect tough . i really wanted to try the goat cheese salad , but there is always next time !
american	take advantage of this opportunity . they use their own mouth-watering , thick-sliced meats and really take the deli sandwich to a new level . i had their classic ham sandwich and it was great . the ham was fantastic , especially when paired with their dijon mustard ( and i don 't even like mustard ! ! ) . the loss of a star here is because the bread was a little tough and roughed up the roof of my mouth . ouch . other than that , it was great and they have a lot of offerings from hot and cold sandwiches , soup , etc . check it out , you 'll like it .
american	ate about two weeks ago . i had avioded it since it opend due to being a wood fire grill . as a vegetarian these tend to have limited fair . not tru here they have an entirely separate menu for vegetarians and it was wonderful . my meat eating friends were also impressed . wait staff was very attentive without being obtrusive .
american	in february of ' 11 , i came here solo , and had the duck . it was superb , with a nice cool beer as the drinking compliment . the restaurant ambiance of weathered wood , and attention to service by staff were other items i noticed . i can highly ( though belatedly , of course ) recommend rf for dinner .
american	my friend and i were early early for a dinner elsewhere but we were hungry so we decided to stop in here for a small bite . we ordered one plate of pierogis ( you get if i remember correctly 8 pieces ) . we chose the mushroom one , half boiled and half fried and it was delicious . the mushrooms had a great meaty texture to them - they didn 't get soggy / over cooked in the dish . the mushroom sauce and sour cream lent the perfect bite to the pierogis . the staff is super friendly and if you check in on yelp you get 15 % off your order . seriously what could be better ?
american	it does get very busy so expect a wait . i ended up coming about an hour before they close and was able to get a seat at the bar straight away . the mimosas are totally worth it . i think they were about $ 6 but they are big and you can tell there is enough champagne in there . highly recommend the eggs benedict . i had the dui of bella bella benny and ham benedict iii . the bella bella was my favorite . definitely get the hash browns extra crispy ... tastes way better . there is so much to choose from and everything that came out of the kitchen looked delicious .
american	our first breakfast choice in vegas superbowl weekend and it was well worth the walk in drizzling rain . bloody mary was delicious as were our meals of the breakfast burrito and della 's breakfast . service was pleasant and both the server and manager were happy to hear abouth their high yelp star rating .
american	think i were there at 8-9 pm july 3 if i don 't remember completely wrong , ordered spaghetti with meatballs . big portion , got really full . nice and kind staff .
american	we went last month in february for our anniversary . the waitress was great . it was crowded , some couples willing to wait a very long time for a table , thankfully my husband made reservations -- he gets five stars just for that ! i had their steak with mashed potatoes and it was a little overcooked i thought that might be because they pre-sliced it . their appetizer bread with goat cheese is great ! we had a mousse with edible flowers - fun to look at and . delicious. don 't forget to make reservations this place gets packed !
american	fresh cut fries , homemade philly and care put into every bite . the meat was sliced in the restaurant and everything was fresh . the owner cared enough to come and check on me and asked how the meal was . he moved here from chicago who knows food and authentic flavors . highly recommend !
american	i love pickles .. but not this one. the tshirts the waiters were wearing were hilarious. my only complaint was that they don 't do anything for birthdays ! anything would of been cool ! especially when they are charging ppl up the whazoo for a simple burger ; )
american	blue plate special was really good , the chicken was one of the most moist and flavorful i 've had in a long time ! the smoked brisket biscuits was tender and delicious . butterscotch cake you will need to share but might not want to . our waitress was super friendly and her busser was funny .
american	huge , hearty , and enough to feed a family of 5 the king 's crown hasn 't disappointed me once in the last 10 years . their breakfast food is really what does it for me though , i could eat nothing but dee 's huevos for days if it were up to me . the atmosphere is a little gritty at times but generally cheerful . some nights the crowd can be a little too 19-21 for my tastes but that 's more of the personal preference . go , you 'll like it !
american	when i enter a restaurant and the host / hostess and servers all seem to be enjoying themselves i get excited about what is to come . people like what they do when ythey are proud of where they work and i was not disappointed in my seablue experience . the staff was knowledgeable and friendly and the food was amazing . i had the spanish bass and it might have been the best bass i 've ever had. the portion was perfection and the food was lovely to look at . that kind of food comes from a chef that loves making food . one of the best dining experiences i 've had !
american	we ordered two meals and spent 24 bucks but it was worth it . it was our first time there and he gave us two free drinks . the kabobs are good but the thing i ordered is divine . garlic feta fries paired with chicken gyro amazing . mu have never tasted anything like it . highly recommend .
american	the food is amazing and the staff is exceptional . they went out of their way to help us with out kids , whom at the time were being animals . they even remembered us from last time we were there months ago . great food , large portions. friendly location . staff is great .
american	a little more then i usually spend on breakfast but the food quality is excellentand so is the service !
american	used yelp and found this close to our hotel at a reasonable price . cool feature was a link to make a reservation using opentable . we got in on an hour 's notice and we watched the place fill up after we were seated . food lived up to the reviews and didn 't hurt wolfgang 's reputation . on a quiet side of the casino which was a relief .
american	we didn 't have a reservation so i wasn 't sure how long we would have to wait . we were told 20 mins but in 10 mins or so our table was ready . our server lydia was awesome ! ! ! she asked if this was our 1st time which it was . she was so excited about her restaurant and told us about how fresh made everything is . i had salmon my other guest had burgers . everything was perfect . great food ! great service ! definitely $ 100 bill worthy .
american	server was a little slow to greeting us , but after that it was great . i can do without the loud birthday songs . they 're obnoxious and completely unnecessary these days . three birthday songs in one meal really brought the experience down from perfect to near perfect . red robin should reconsider doing this dated old tradition . dorky family members will be disappointed , but the rest of us will not miss this loud spectacle . excellent food and the fries cannot be beat !
american	we ordered the turkey club--average fare , what you expect for a turkey club . upgraded to the parmesan fries--good , but not overly special . the real highlight was the banana split . i would go here again just for the view of the conservatory and to have that amazing dessert . caramelized bananas , dark chocolate / strawberry / vanilla bean ice creams topped with whipped cream , chocolate decor , and fresh raspberries .
american	a little noisy most dishes are excellent lobster salad and flank stake but some of the dishes just ok overall solid but not as out of the world as bazaar in beverly hills
american	it 's easy to overlook but don 't make that mistake . beautiful patio great for meeting friends for a great cup of coffee hot or cold . the owners happen to be good friends . the best .
american	this was because the grotto takes reservations which is nice .. as long as you can make it . we sat at the bar instead ( one of my fav thing to do anyway ) . food was pretty good , typical vegas over priced but its hard to find anything around that compares with a good atmosphere surrounding it .
american	truffle egg sandwich was incredible ! and the potatoes were so well flavored you didn 't need to add ketchup or hot sauce . just an all around great dining experience .
american	moved here a few years back from downtown , bring a good reputation . the owner is hands on with the kitchen and dining area , allowing for a welcoming service . small but covered menu . always interesting specials . a restaurant i frequent .
american	) but huge portions of great food - salad , palate cleansing gelato and chocolate covered strawberries with every entree . would definitely recommend checking it out if you 're in old vegas
american	the crispy panini bread alone is worth coming back over and over again . they make sure that your order is delicious and filling . comes with chips , a side and a pickle . go here if you 're looking for the ultimate sandwich .
american	best steak i 've ever had . it 's the only place i 'll go for steak now , i don 't see the point of getting steak from outback or any of the casual places any more . of course due to the cost , i only go a couple of times a year but that 's how good it is ... i 've drastically cut down on my steak consumption because it 's turned me into a steak snob ! ! waiting staff are excellent ! the decor is pretty damn cool . in a city is relatively young , it has a sense of history . love it !
american	my wife and i spent the entire time staring into each others ey ... i mean spent the entire time looking out the window . it was worth the extra money .
american	it 's across the street from my office , so we 're in here often . don 't miss their own made chips with ranch dressing . excellent on the side with one of their burgers instead of fries , they are just as good as a shared appetizer if you 're just having drinks . speaking of burgers , don 't miss ' em . good quality meat with the right toppings , or get one of their pizzas . i like the margretira which has sliced tomatoes and fresh basil . i 've been here a bunch of times and i 'll be back again a bunch more !
american	not really a place for children although we have taken our kids in before . the halibut is excellent as is the steak . this is a good place for special occasions .
american	and the eggs benedict . they do get fairly busy but the wait time is less than 20 minutes . you have indoor or outdoor seating .
american	the granola and yogurt are the best in phx , and the baked goods are amazing . i also like ordering a side of veggie hash and their pork belly bacon . try the room in the back where it is a little quieter once you break they the lines , but anyone who has not been here needs to try it - you will return .
american	i was here with a group and everyone liked their meals . the waitress was friendly and knowledgable . while it was a little pricey you feel like you got a good quality meal for the price . they seem to support local farmers etc ... to flush out their menu which is a nice touch .
american	you need to get the flying circus ! ! ! such a yummy drink ! !
american	it 's definitely got an air of trendiness and it 's a little expensive , but it 's good food and a good time , so i can 't ding it .
american	their orange juice is obviously fresh squeezed and amazing ! ! the staff is very friendly but the place is very small and the chairs are not that comfortable . it 's very cramped inside but the service has always been superb and fast . however , the wait time is often very long on a saturday morning and the hosts seem to just stand around instead of lending a helping hand with bussing the tables .
american	flat bread instead of typical pizza crust . fire cooked . all around win for us . will definitely have to come back here sometime
american	the decor was lovely and our waitress was lovely . definitely visiting again : )
american	we went for brunch and weren 't disappointed , the views from the patio are impressive ! my husband and i decided to brunch like millenials and ordered the avocado toast and had a few mimosas-really yummy . an attentive , kind server made for a perfect time- we 'll be back for a sunset dinner soon !
american	excellent service ( even when seated in a corner ) . server jason ( ? ) greeted me within seconds and had coffee on the table before i could open the menu . so many menu choices and even tho it was lunchtime i was ready for breakfast . opted for cheese blintzes with eggs and sausage . perfectly prepared with a light two cheese filling . too bad they 're hidden by home depot but once you find them you 'll go " crackers " for breakfast or lunch .
american	delicious diner-style food , reasonable prices , and a large selection . what you would expect from a good diner . the pierogies are delicious and can come as a side for most any dish .
american	it 's not what i call trendy but definitely seems like it 's in an up and coming part of vegas that really appears to appeal to locals and tourists ( if you are smart enough to do your homework ) . the food portions are substantial and taste is above average . though i have to say they are far superior in the way of service . everyone is super nice and attentive but with a laid back style i appreciate . this is the place to be if you are looking for that unique find off strip .
american	typical diner food . good quality , good quantity . i 've always had pleasant service here . only stopped for breakfast , but this should be a good lunch stop as well . open extended hours if there is an event at the speedway complex ( you probably wouldn 't want to come out here on a race day unless you were going to the race though ! ) .
american	we had the spanish omelet n pancakes .. pancakes are one of the best i have had ... n the staff never let 's your coffee cup go empty ... a really good place in all ! ! !
american	so far it 's the best poutine i 've had in town . i love the peanut bombs even though i hate peanuts . they 're just unique and fun . i 've tried a few things here and usually i 'm pretty happy with it . the only thing i didn 't like much was the mushroom cap burger .
american	i had the hams teak and eggs with hash browns . nothing left on the plate but the gam bone .
american	and the restaurant has a fun new orleans feel to it . great date place !
american	i had the blt and really enjoyed it . i would definitely eat here again . the decor is really awesome , as well .
american	truly a top notch , quality meal . best pancakes around
american	a little over priced otherwise 5stars , i eat here weekly and the desserts are awesome love the breakfast / lunch menu !
american	if you 've always wanted to have chef to cook for you this is the place ! if you 're a picky eater i suggest you call ahead of time to check up on what is being served here . the menu varies day by day and is usually up to the chef to decide . if you 're having dinner here i recommend bringing a nice bottle of wine to enjoy with your dinner . talk to the chef and you 'll have a lovely dinner !
american	fast service , plenty of seating , and kept clean like disneyland . their italian beef , fries , and chocolate cake shake are all to die for .
american	if you 're looking for a great burger there are less expensive options . but sometimes you need a fun gordon ramsay experience . everybody who has tried the farm burger loves it . get the onion rings . amazing .
american	presentation of food was a bonus . ambiance and specialty drinks are great . for my husband and me , this isn 't a place where we might go all the time during the weekday , but probably more a place where we would take friends visiting in town or for special occasions .
american	the corn soup is the best i 've tasted in vegas and i also had the butternut squash ravioli and it was okay but the portion was small ( honestly , you can buy buitoni butternut squash ravioli from the grocery store and it does taste better ) . the complimentary breads are tasty and beautifully served and the desserts are just okay . i recommend trying this place for a pretty good quality lunch or dinner , but skip the dessert . or heck , just go for really good soup and bread !
american	) so we did dinner at the buffet . the selection was pretty good , solid and well planned out . the prime rib was very good as was the chicken marsala , though it could have been warmer . my husband loved the sushi . big fan of the carrot cake , as it was moist and fresh and very well made . over all , a solid 3.5 stars .
american	it was pretty good for $ 5.99 . cheese sticks were good too . nice tavern atmosphere . good service , food came out quick .
american	i love all the different options ( fancy nancy is great ) , and highly recommend getting the bread toasted on your sandwich . the grape salad is delicious too !
american	love the lavender white mocha . i usually get the seasonal pancakes or seasonal scramble . i like the ambiance of the place too .
american	the food is incredible ( among the top five wings in the city , as far as i 'm concerned ) and always fresh--a refreshing and wonderful change from typical crappy bar food . the atmosphere is clean , cool , homey and modern--and there 's nothing like being served an ice-cold goblet ( yes , goblet ) of great local beer . what every friendly neighborhood bar should be .
american	very good microbrews , best battered fish ever , sides all topnotch . i took off one star because they charge 2.50 for simple substitutions or minor additions . they also booked a kids bday party in the bar ? what ? i left my own kids home ... to have adult time away ... ?
american	they especially found great options for me during pregnancy . great location for a foodie experience .
american	the salad with the yogurt dressing is amazing ( though heavy on dressing so you may want to order it on the side ) . the artichoke appetizer i dream about even though it is only available like 1 / 4 times i go . and the cheesecake ... yum !
american	yum ! you can taste how natural and organic it is ! ! great seating outside . relaxing and there are misters . great place to hang outside .
american	i 'm glad they finally put one on this side of town . right now it stays packed because it 's new but i will have this spot in heavy rotation .
american	we ordered the mac and cheese balls which to be honest could have been a little creamier . the chicken wings tossed in their house made honey garlic and oyster sauce was finger licking good ! the peruvian tacos came in 6 and you build them yourself which is better than most restaurants . we also got a meat lovers pizza that could have been cooked longer . they also had a pretty decent drink menu . our server was great ! she was attentive and food came out quick .
american	they have messed up on my order a few times but were always quick to fix it without hassle . the italian sandwich is delicious and i love their balsamic vinegar . both the tomato soup and broccoli soup are very good as well . the caprese sandwich is also very delicious but beware if your taking it togo the bread can get a little soggy pretty quick so eat it there if you can .
american	i had the protein omelet . full of flavor . best breakfast i have had in vegas . sat outside and loved it . would have rated 5 stars but they could not get the patio heaters to work .
american	you 'd need at least 3 pizzas to feed 4 adults , btw .
american	i loved luke 's growing up in chicago , and i love that there 's something very similar in the valley . the hotdogs come on a poppy seed bun . " everything " includes mustard , tomato , peppers , neon green relish , pickle , and celery salt . no ketchup . just like a tried and true chicago hot dog joint . the italian beef is awesome . make sure to include the peppers if you want it done right . on the randomness factor . they serve rc cola . i think luke 's is the only place in the world , let alone arizona , that still carries rc .
american	milkshakes were cloyingly sweet and i couldn 't finish mine . burgers , fish , and steak sandwiches were delicious . fries are average . nice , well-executed decor .
american	i took my mother , 3 kids , & a gf for a birthday celebration ... we took lots of great pics , since it 's right on the strip . food was wonderful , drinks were fine , but the frozen hot chocolate was to die for ! we will definitely go back & that 's from a native local ! !
american	i tried their kiesh last time i was there and it was so delicious ! i will definitely be going back sometime soon . friendly staff as well !
american	best brick oven pizza ever and for the quality damn the price !
american	we also tried the shakes chocolate very rich pee my niece but the strawberry was creamy and yummy !
american	i ate the turkey club which was delicious and loaded with bacon . the cappuccino was very good . the gelato banana split was amazing ! ! the menu looked limited at two am but we asked for something not on the menu and they made it .
american	i had the chicken parm , my wife had the salmon , my kid had the pizza and we all thought the food was delicious . the peach mixed drinks were also very tasty . thumbs up !
american	one of my favorite places to go for vegan pizzas .
american	both the blueberry griddle cakes and the bbq eggs benny are delicious + the spicy honey is great . servings are generous too
american	pleasantly surprised with the flavors . also , they don 't have a " kids menu " but we asked our waitress and she told us they do have kids items . she told us what was available and the kids picked from those .
american	i used to think big al 's had the best , but no more . also there is no place in the entire restaurant including outside where you dont have a view of multiple hd tvs . great place for sports . if you cant tell i 'm sold . if you live in the area and plan on going alot , sign up for the brewuniversity card . its like the flying saucer reward system but with more and better prizes , atleast in my opinion .
american	we enjoyed the ambiance and drinks were tasty too . henderson needs more places like this . we joined them for a saturday happy hour : crab cake , filet mignon tacos and spinach dip .
american	have been here a couple times but enjoyed it enough to go for the platinum club ....
american	i do wish they had a burger 21 closer to the university city area ... for us ... the drive was about 35 minutes one way but well worth it .
american	the food is made fresh to every order , combos come with a delicious greek salad
american	you order at the counter and then they bring the food to your table . we had to wait about ten minutes or so for the food to arrive . the cajun fries were great and they threw in free ranch with them . the place was clean and a good overall environment . we will definitely be returning !
american	wine is half price on wednesday . my favorite dish is the cioppino steamer bowl .
american	service is excellent . the food is very , very healthy . i would recommend this place to anybody who likes greek or middle eastern food and enjoys a wonderful atmosphere . i get the stuffed grape leaves ( dawali ) , hummus and hot sauce . it 's tasty ! you get fresh , excellent pita bread with it .
american	i really love their benedicts and my girlfriend realy loves their hashes . the milkshakes are really good too . only thing disappointing is that the menu changes and then your favorite thing is gone . the thing you wanted to order when you were thinking about going there . seasonal menu woes . also , the home fries are lame . they 're basically home fry shaped french fries . no seasoning or delicious onions mixed in , they 're just fried potato chunks .
american	i 've had tastier black & bleu burgers , but it was cooked to perfection , true medium rare like i like them . my husband 's french dip was also excellent . i also commend them for not undercooking the asparagus spears . i would come here again in a heartbeat.this place is said to be haunted but we didn 't run into any spirits .
american	our steak entrees were delicious and we loved the calamari and the lobster mac and cheese .
american	our server was great . i had a blue cheese encrusted beef tenderloin and my girlfriend had butternut squash ravioli . both enteees were the best meals we 've had in months . we ordered the coffee gelato and donuts for dessert . hands down , best dessert here ! jalapeño jam margarita was great , so great , i ordered three ! great meal and atmosphere for new years eve !
american	but the food was very good . all natural ingredients and a great vegan selection . red velvet dessert was good . i had kale , broccoli chicken sauté dish . friends had sweet and sour chicken , tuna melt wrap and vegan tuna melt panini . all was good . will go back again .
american	i 'm not the biggest fan of orange juice but i went out on a limb and ordered it here . definitely a must have if you like orange juice . i 'd eat here again .
american	the food is always delicious and makes you feel good after eating it . the staff are friendly and the setting is great . one of our favorite places to eat !
american	the food and service was good , too . the chocolate cake was awesome . the games are diverse and entertaining . they have something for all ages .
american	you get a lot of food and it was really good . don 't get the texas toast , it 's not texas toast it 's normal toasted bread , get the corn bread instead !
american	the food and service were excellent . if you find yourself there and not craving a burger , you 'd do fine with the soba chicken salad .
american	beef carpaccio was amazing ... nice service at the bar , food was delicious , we had a small snafu with one of the appetizers but management quickly swooped in to rectify ... love that more than anything ! we are local and we appreciate the good service and lovely ingredients ! robert at the bar was outstanding ! thank you for everything !
american	cool , clean and modern inside . delicious , healthy food . large menu with lots of choices .
american	it 's typical to spend around $ 15 for 2 people , which for fast food is up there . even though the yelp pricer thing say , cheap ? turkey with corn and mash potatoes and mac n cheese . mmmmm . i only with they still had the sirloin .
american	very nice . we did the buffet . 6 and under are free and other kids are half . salad bar was very good as well . again , it is pricey ( about $ 40 / person ) but if you buy the 1 / 2 ticket at one of the booths on the strip , it is definitely worth it .
american	but all in all , no complaints . food was very good and variety was awesome . plenty there to cover most food wants and needs , including gluten-free and lactose-free . i 'm not affected by either of those really , but good to see they thought of those people who are . and when you 're hungover , wicked spoon is a great place to get you back on track .
american	we sat on the balcony , and enjoyed a view of the golf course . the service was lacking a little ( we had to find a waitress when we first sat down and continued to look for someone for refills for water ) . this place is on my list of top burger places in the valley but just be prepared for the bill .
american	we had the bbq burger and patty melt ( each came with fries ) and both were delicious . we usually take out , but the cafe has a cute and cozy atmosphere and would totally eat in for a lunch date . can 't wait to try the breakfast !
american	it was sunday and i was home so i drove myself and man was it worth it . it reminded me of when they were on baythorn in thornhill . i got a gnocchi in a vodka sauce added mushrooms , my wife got a veal sandwich . wow ! tasty , tasty . i need to check out everything on the menu in the next few weeks . see ya later dante 's , no more business from me .
american	the gyro was pretty bomb . i can honestly say it was the best gyro i have ever had in my life . the homemade tzsiki sauce ( sp ? ) was sooo good , it was literally the icing on the cake haha definitely a stop for me on the way to vegas or on the way home from vegas because its open 24 hours !
american	the regular menu provides a small selection of thoroughly uninspired breakfast , egg , salad , pasta and other options , but the winner is the gourmet sandwiches . i 've tried a few of them and won 't order anything else off the menu . it 's unfortunate that the restaurant is usually empty , at least in my experience , but service is usually slow : i 've only seen about three of their tables occupied at once , tops , and therefore there 's only ever one waiter and one cook . the food is consistent and fresh , service friendly and helpful , and ambience nil . sushi menu options are good and surprisingly filling , but definitely overpriced .
american	the wings were some of the best that i have ever had . the new vinegar sauce is awesome and they need to sell it . the kids meal is enough for an adult .
american	a little pricey for what you get , but i tried the mac and cheese samosas and the crispy eggplant sandwich and they were both bomb ! !
american	but the food is delicious , and the ambiance is quite unique . the szechuan pork belly was a great starting bite , the wine list was more impressive than i was expecting , and the salmon with polenta was perfectly tender and delicious - despite the understandable skepticism about smoked and then roasted . and because i 'm a huge sucker who can 't say ' no ' to a dessert , i packed the chocolate torte in every available remaining cranny . painfully stuffed , but unbelievably satisfied , i almost forgot that i had work to do the next day . next time i 'm in town , this place will definitely be on my short list .
american	went on a friday around 4pm seated right away . server was very nice and helpful . food was great ! hush puppies bomb ! had lobster / shrimp / king crab with trifecta seasoning great combo be prepared to get dirty ! they do have a near by hand washing spot great idea ! i will be coming back to try other combos !
american	that said , this was probably the best gluten free pizza i 've had . got the margherita base and added broccoli , roasted garlic , and 3 shredded cheeses . awesome .
american	the drinks seem very expensive but they taste great . we had the breakfast burrito ( it 's " the best eggs i 've ever had " said my husband ) with the 2 shot bacon infused bourbon bloody mary and huevos benedicto with bottomless mimosa . we 'd definitely eat here again . our waitress cheryl was awesome .
american	totally worth every penny , i loved not just the food but the environment . it was fun and the service was great ! i highly recommend this place
american	salads are generous portions made with fresh ingredients and very tasty vinaigrette and between their interesting pre-made salads and their fully customizable options the choice is endless !
american	a little pricy but the quality of the food , the service of the host / server , and the location was worth it .
american	fresh food great service . it does get crowded but i have had braekfast and lunch here and both are very good .
american	i will definitely come back . the tomato bisque soup was very good ...
american	beautiful views and great customer service . the technology for this range is amazing compared to all of the other ranges i 've been to in the city . will definitely keep coming back .
american	the food is really great and plentiful ! tasty , tasty ! we loved this little hole in the wall that seemed to host the local greek population . chicken souvlaki , gyro ( yum ) , calamar and deal we 're all delicious . highly recommend !
american	very friendly server , atmosphere is good . moderately priced , lots of families eating together .
american	the walleye and eggs , might be the best breakfast i 've ever had . simple but absolutely delicious . good coffee too . tasted my friends eggs benedict also excellent . the cook knows his stuff .
american	a little short staffed during our visit , but extremely friendly counter service and drop dead delicious burgers !
american	we were so happy when portillo 's came to arizona . delicious italian beef sandwiches , hot dogs , burgers and salads . it 's a regular stop for us !
american	giordano 's deep dish pizza is worth the wait ! fortunately , we were able to be seated right away but if it was an hour wait , i would ! we had a group of four and a large was enough for us . i love that you can make your own and do half one style and half another . it takes about 45 minutes to make the pizza and it 's hot when it gets to you ! you definitely get what you pay for !
american	perfect place to get your slider fix . it 's a quaint restaurant , easy parking , fast service and reasonably priced . best part is ... they don 't mind when i wear my st. louis cardinals hat . get there early , they unfortunately close at 8pm
american	had the chicken gyro amd humus for lunch . it was so good i 've been talking about it all day .
american	perfect for picking up a big bo box of tailgate goods or a morning biscuit .
american	delicious food , delightful server and great ambiance ! we had the marinated skirt steak ( medium rare ) and it was cooked perfectly ! the grilled sweet potatoes were delicious !
american	french fries seem to be a problem at all these stores .... ts either soggy or overcooked.wish they would focus on putting out better golden crunchy fries . asked for light well , and got potato chips !
american	highly recommend the betty boob and the soul platter . their chicken is outstanding . we will be back .....
american	the california club is made fresh and is amazing . i recommend getting it on a croissant , but i 'm a sucker for anything on a croissant . definitely would recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap , fast breakfast .
american	this quaint eatery has a great menu and great service . they cook to order , so everything is piping hot when it gets to the table . best of all , they have kool aid ! woohoo !
american	ribs fall off the bone and the corn bread is so sweet and yummy !
american	a little stingy on the lobster for the price of $ 20 , otherwise quick service and good sandwich
american	it was a treat to see something quick and easy as i ran from one flight to the next . not sure if they always run the ( 2 ) for $ 7 deal , but i enjoyed my salty pretzels and sweet twizzlers . the prices are ridiculously high , but you really can 't expect more from an airport !
american	good food . basic choices . all homemade and served with a smile . sit on the patio facing the green or find a comfy booth inside .
american	though some might complain that blue door is somewhat pricey for a brunch hot-spot , everything is worth it . they have a strong commitment to fresh , high quality , locally & ethically-raised / grown ingredients . all of their baked goods are exceptional . i can 't say i 've ever had such delicious croissants or english muffins . absolutely the best brunch spot in the greater akron area .
american	david and his staff are amazing ! i even walked out of there with a free shirt to represent this amazing place . i hope to see you guys in gilbert ! go blue !
american	vernors , faygo and coneys ! ! ! come here and get your fix ( even if you 're not from mi ) .
american	well i have found a match , you have gourmet burgers , fast food burgers , even veggie burgers but these guys have it done right . soft buns that hold up to the fixings ( don 't get soggy ) flavorful meat 80 / 20 most likely . a price that makes mcdonald 's look expensive ! if you love burgers of old , and really want the best burger for your buck , get to lenny 's and have a bite of heaven wrapped in paper , the old fashioned way !
american	originally made reservations at hugo 's cellar but decided a $ 250 dinner would not be enjoyable for me . i made a great choice ! had the filet , which was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth . sides were delicious and loaf of bread on the table was as well . service was great and we got out of there for under $ 75 including 20 % tip . i will be back . also , got a $ 20 match play coupon by checking in to yelp : ) . machines were pretty tight but at least i got to play for a while .
american	we sat out on the patio in perfect summer weather and felt very cultured and trendy ( at least , i did ) as i sipped on a mojito and ate my fancy pizza ( see image provided by amy t ) . i think this place would be great for a group happy hour as we did , or perhaps for a hot , impressive date .
american	service is great and the outside seating is wonderful in newly revitalized downtown . close to all the local jobs , courts , and firms , so the location is ideal . wait time is decent and the waiters / waitresses have always been pleasant .
american	it was my first time at a fancy italian place so i 'll add it has a nice authentic vibe to it i showed up with out a reservation so it was about a 30 minute wait would definitely recommend a reservation but overall the service was great it was fast the food was delicious it is served with complimentary bread so that goes great with all the meals overall very happy with my visit
american	i hate that you have to valet especially when i can see open spots 5 feet away , but the lot is limited in space so i get it . i 've been here twice for brunch and left satisfied both times . we tried the eggs benedict with smoked salmon which was unusual but good , the mushroom omelette with yummy goat cheese , and a cinnamon role which was superb .
american	two eggs , cheese , bacon , and sausage on one of carl jr . ' s great biscuits ! don 't tell my cardiologist !
american	a little wait but worth it .... yummy food , great portions , good service but mabye a few more servers would help .... will definitely be back
american	seems like 8 mins for a burger no fries . my experience is still good on a rainy day . when my burger arrived looks like it was cooked medium like i asked . tastes like five guys a little bit , decent burger . the bt sauce on the table adds a better version of the hornets burger i ordered . i like bacon with my burger comes with the hornets burger .
american	local locations growing , so food and service getting building a reputation !
american	the fried chicken , pork chops and étouffée are must-haves. sometimes they have live music and serve abita .
american	the pepper jack cheezeburger was really good . ditto for the " spicy pub chips . " the prime rib sammich was a bit small but very good . wife liked it .
american	i like these chicago style dogs better than costco or other shops .
american	no bigger than 20x20 inside . there is no seating so plan on taking it to go . we ordered 6 different sandwiches and the entire family agreed it was the best sandwich they had ever had . very creative sandwiches but they also provide the basics for the kids .
american	today 's beef tartare was excellent , the duck was out of control and the creme brûlée was insanely good ! ! highly recommended . it is byo only so remember to take wine with you ! !
american	it was exactly what it should be , the perfect amount of food , all delicious . patrice was a fantastic server , attentive and helpful without being at all overbearing . they had different options for the courses and each of us tried different things . all of us were quite happy , however , the mushroom risotto stood out as the best of the entrees and the rabbit as the best of the apps . great experience , right near centre bell .
american	good cold slaw . we loved the french fries . the bread is wonderful . lots of butter -- very rich . also a messy sandwich so order extra napkins ! large area upstairs . wait staff was excellent . nice place for lunch on the strip . casual .
american	everything was fresh and cooked perfectly . we ordered the chicago style hotdog , ( realky good and different ) philly cheesestaeak , the california burger , sweet potatoe fries , and onion rings ! onion rings were so bomb and fresh ! we would highly recommend this restaurant at anytime of the day ! good thing it 's open 24 hrs a day ! ! ! the cook ralphy was awesome polite , and so respectful as our old school latinos are . the cashier judianna has awesome customer service . we will be back again ! ! ! ( sooner than later ! i hope ! )
american	we ordered the butterscotch pancakes , works skillet , works omelette , crazy chicken omelette , veggie sunrise omelette and egg benedict with gravy . everything tasted great , the portion sizes are big , we had a lot of left overs . i would recommend sharing if you are not a big breakfast eater . their banana muffins were soft and moist , i definitely would come back if i 'm ever back in the vegas area .
american	i can 't imagine coming here and not doing serious damage to your wallet because everything looks so good . the employees are awesome too , very knowledgeable and willing to help . we bought 3 kinds of fresh sausage , 2 kinds of hard sausage , their last denver steak , and split a fresh sandwich which was excellent . i highly recommend getting some ghost peperone , so good and a little spicy .
american	try the greek salad . best in the city by a landslide . you can split the small for two . souvlaki is awesome too . parking is terrible . get creative . enjoy !
american	nothing compliments their gyros quite like their feta fries ! crispy , seasoned fries with cheese baked on top with their secret sauce and tzatziki to dip in ! heaven !
american	don 't look for craft beer or anything canadian , these guys are called home of the brave for a reason . love the open kitchen in the back and the chill vibe in the front . call the chef in the back " captain america " see what he says ....
american	this one is no exception . even in a busy saturday morning in december our waiter is on it and the food is delicious
american	and i was not disappointed ! hot crispy wings with a mix of scorching plus honey garlic was just the ticket at the end of a long day full of business meetings . the wait staff was friendly and helpful . the beers on tap are amazingly numerous . a local brew was my pick . i will come back here for sure .
american	capriotti 's gives hungry sandwich searchers a haven filled with good eats at reasonable prices . their location is right off the strip and not terribly hard to get to . parking is abundant . the service was prompt and courteous . the food , it was quite tasty . i mean , how can you go wrong with a philly cheesesteak ? the bread was soft but crusty , the meat and fix 'n's were all cooked to order . the only downside to the shop is that it 's on the small side . you won 't be able to fit a large group in here , but if you get your sandwich to-go you won 't have an issue with that .
american	i had the texas bbq burger- it was really tasty- fries were good to . we love the name ! i wonder if they realize that 's the name of the place brad works at in fast times at ridgemont high ? only thing that could have made the place better ? if spicoli was there- lol : ) no shirts no shoes no dice !
american	amazing ! had the chili dog with fries and a small soda . price is affordable and the service is 5 star ! every employee there was smiling and happy to be working . they have tons of options and they make recommendations on the fly . great burger place . i will definitely be coming back next time i visit metrocenter mall .
american	two burger patties with american cheese , lettuce , tomato , and a sauce that 's awesome , all crammed in a pita . fries are great . the chicken pita is also great . we always stop here when we are through the area . this is a great place if your rolling through . stop by and check it out .
american	the bar is a decent size with some outside seating where you basically stare at the light rail : ) . there is a decent selection of beer and the service is fast . all american is a great spot for football and a better option than tavern on the tracks or gin mlll if you are in this area . what suprised me the most was the food . i thought it was going to be so so , but the food was actually very good and the price point wasn 't high at all . for now this is my sunday football spot .
american	i 'm in . i like earl so much that it makes me want to stay at planet hollywood for the sole purpose of walking downstairs for a sandwich ( and / or soup ) .
american	it was my first time at dilly 's . the staff was courteous , the food was good , the wifi--a bit slow . i will definitely return , especially since they have happy hour prices after 2 for the summer .
american	nice service . salad bar and soup bar are full of food . they offer many soups and toppings for your salads ! !
american	best soulfood ! was look for some collard greens for weeks and failed at other places but this place was amazing ! !
american	when dining here , i recommend the tasting menu paired with the wine pairings . this is the best way to experience george , since you will try things that you may not usually order . great upscale dining ambiance , lovely plating , and unique flavours .
american	we chose to partake is the tasting menu because it included the risotto and beef wellington and of course due to hk gordon ramsey is know for these . we also chose the wine pairing . everything was awesome ! service was great . the price shows how great it is . after all including tax and tip we spent $ 592 for two people and it was worth it ! !
american	i always enjoy visiting . the lentil salad and baklava are excellent !
american	small plates and pizzettes - all very tasty . it was a busy night , and the staff were running , and attentive throughout . hats off to the guys in the open kitchen , they were cranking it !
american	has a very home like feeling , seemed as all other patrons were enjoying there time there .
american	veggies are crisp and fresh . the burger patties are done but not dried out . they have a nice flavor too . the burger doesn 't come the way i like it but they are very accommodating when i ask for it my way . staff is friendly and the place is clean , modern and has a nice atmosphere . always busy it seems , but you still get your order quick and hot . i like the fries better at mcd 's but the burgers are great ! one of the best burgers in town .
american	the workers were friendly , very informative , and the food was outstanding . i recommend the pulled pork and a loaded potatoe .
american	service was great , appetizer fondue melts with deliciousness , salads were good , salmon very fresh , ravioli tasty , and dessert like silk . i saw a review before going that stated the food was " bland . " personally bland was not at all the case ! the fondue that i got was gorgonzola and bacon both are very rich in flavor . they seem to use a lot of garlic as well . with the dinner entrees we were given 5 boats of various sauces and a garlic / wine seasoning . if you use what is given the food was far from bland . the atmosphere is romantic and private . i highly recommend this place .
american	we have dined at fahrenheit twice now and no complaints . staff was great ! our waiter , zach , was very , very pleasant ! food both times was delicious ! great menu and presentation was impressive ! and , of course , the view ! ! what a sunset ! fun to order a bunch of appetizers ! all were great ! would probably skip what they call " nachos " next time . plate full of fried potato slices ( chips ) with cheese sauce drizzled over it . just too much . save your appetite for all the other delicious menu items ! get a seat by the window if possible . the bar is great too ! two very enthusiastic thumbs up !
american	i had the piri piri chicken , and my friend got the chicken bacon sandwich . really cool american diner vibes , cheap drinks , and great wait staff ! for two americans studying abroad in spain , it was nice to eat some american style foods : )
american	the meats are tender with lots of flavor . portions are generous and could easily make two meals out of it ( i should give it 5 stars for that ) don 't miss out on the hummus it is heavenly ! they also have some juicing concoctions that i enjoy while i wait .
american	attention to the smallest details made this meal ( including me the service ) amazing from start to finish .
american	from the friendly valet across the street to the attentive waitstaff and the friendly host , all were just terrific . the food was excellent . the chef masterfully combined an eclectic array of ingredients to create flavor masterpieces . i personally loved that the chef was daring to push the spice limit ... i enjoyed my creekstone filet. finally something with flavor and heat . not another safe , bland and boring steak dish ! awesome job !
american	tender filet , all food served at perfect temperatures , great prompt service even on a busy night . these folks seem to have their act well together .
american	first time from friends ' suggestion ( brent & kati ) . they placed an order and i came by to pick it up . i 'm not much of a salad eater but i did order one of their popular salads , kati ordered salad with falafel & a side of rice and brent ordered a dish with some kind of steak . i tried a little bit of everything as they shared and everything was delicious ! the food was prepared quickly so a very short wait and the employees were very helpful and friendly . i can see why they have very good reviews ! will definitely come back .
american	all vegan and veggiterian . lots of gluten free options and made with the same ingredients i 'd use to cook at home . i love a good stake dinner from time to time but beverly has the health food when i need a quick meal for the family and i 'm rolling through town . i also love that i can get some fresh farmers market produce while i 'm there from her father . can 't go wrong
american	had the bacon cheeseburger and it was pretty tasty . and depending where they get the potatoes , the fries are a hit or miss . love the peanuts !
american	options for gluten free . ask the waiter / waitress about dietary restrictions . they have a helpful dietary card . burgers are amazing . make sure to check out the pickle bar . all around great experience . a must try !
american	this is my favorite place for gyros . best for lunch or takeout , the seating is ok but the place is usually full . everything ive tried on the menu has been very good , we eat lunch here on a regular basis and its just constantly good . all the greek food is good or better than you would expect , but the biggest surprise is the hot wings , and their cheap too .
american	compared to big restaurant chains , i would pick burger joint hands down any day . staff is friendly and atmosphere is perfect . nothing obnoxious , just great food , friendly people , and easing going environment .
american	comfortable bar experience , but with great service , diverse craft beer on draft and most importantly a menu that you won 't find elsewhere . from mac and cheese with pork belly to surf and turf philly cheesesteak with lobster . if your a foody , this is the place for you .
american	friendly hosts and waitress . menu has plenty of great options - burgers , fries , chicken , ahi ... had the ringer . great burger . everything about it was spot on - flavors were fantastic , meat like melted in my mouth , bacon was crispy and flavorful . fries were crispy and nicely salted . green chili cheese was a nice side . cool ambiance . price is as expected for a nice burger place .
american	have been to southern rail a number of times . i have had nothing but great experiences here so far . i frequent the bar and the bartenders are always pleasant with me . the food at this place is excellent . i have always loved southern style food and their twist on southern is very worth while . i would recommend this place to anyone who values good service , great tasting food , accommodating staff , and a fresh friendly environment .
american	staff is very friendly and keeps the customer in mind . if you are looking for a great bbq then this place is a must try . it 's hard to find good pulled pork and good bbq sauce and rynos does it well . all the sides i have had are really good especially the southwest style cream corn and the sweet beans .
american	i had the kobe short ribs which were excellent . the seafood platter appetizer we ate was fresh and fantastic . good service and great wine man .
american	patio is fantastic ! people are fun ! food is interesting and fresh ! and i can bring my dog !
american	you can 't beat the value as their prices are very reasonable for the amount of food that you get . service is friendly , quick , and top-notch . athena 's is one of my favorite places for lunch during the workday and dinner on those late nights in the office . i will continue to go back .
american	the place is busy . i was expecting a wait but wow was the service quick . you get in line to order and then are given a number to take to your table . the service is fantastic . we had a lunch sandwich , a breakfast sandwich , and pancakes . each item was crazy good . the croissant bacon egg sandwich was perfection . the sandwiches came with fried potatoes . the drinks were good . fantastic non-alcoholic brunch option for the strip district .
american	all around home run for these guys just make sure your not seated in the middle of the dining room because the traffic was to much we asked to be moved and they accommodated us beautifully thank you for a wonderful experience
american	must haves include the piglet risotto and cavatelli snow crab .
american	yes , there was a line-but the wait was not bad-friendly gal distributed menus and managed crowd well . once inside , the folks taking the order were super-efficient and madison friendly . my son ordered the breakfast sandwich , my wife had an omelette and i did the standard 2 eggs over easy . the potatoes were amazing , eggs great , fresh-squeezed oj delicious , sandwich and omelette got rave reviews . the experience eating here was perfect . everything a breakfast should be . can 't wait to go back again next uw visit .
american	the turkey sandwich is amazing here , ask for extra gravy .. you 'll thank me later . the pastrami and corned beef was pretty amazing as well .
american	what a special place . don 't miss the hummus . my salad ( house ) was fresh and properly dressed . the lamb was prepared just as i asked . i 'm still puzzled by how they can prepare simple rice with so much flavor . the service was warm and knowledgable . i will be back .
american	good food , quick service by friendly staff , train decor and decent prices . breakfast and lunch was good .
american	the secret battle monkey double ipa is one of the smoothest ipa 's i 've ever had . good munchy food too . i 'll definitely be back
american	first time in , had the italian on sub roll and was excellent ! ! they also have soups , i sampled the turkey corn chowed and could have had that alone as my lunch . very good food !
american	there so many different food variations offered- from thai to indian to italian to seafood etc ( you get the point ) . most buffets may offer an abundance of food , but they usually lack taste . this place actually has great tasting food . i would recommend this place to buffet lovers , i am not one myself , but i enjoyed it here .
american	decor is canadian rustic chic , with exposed wood and carvings of fir trees and moose . super friendly and helpful service . started with an amazing caesar , just the right amount of booze and spice . had the beans and greens salad to start , nothing too groundbreaking , but a nice basic fresh green salad . had the lamb shoulder as the main course , tender and flavourful , a bit like a moroccan tagine in flavour but not as sweet . sauce was just a touch on the overly salty side . great little unique spot , definitely worth checking out .
american	it was kind of empty .. but due to that it has been closed for so long that 's understandable . i had bacon club on wheat toast . can 't possibly go wrong and it was perfect . does not come with sides but i had fries and wow they were great ... very crispy almost battered . buddy had chicken noodle soup and the sausage and onions . two thumbs up from him . they do only accept cash but i understand why . pos sales on debit cards can quickly eat into a slim profit margin . maybe give a discount for cash and charge a little more for debit ? going back .
american	however with this chick-fil-a the service is even better than usual . would highly recommend .
american	this place is always packed and despite the crowds the service levels and the quality of the food remain high . if you are looking for a healthier alternative this place is definitely a good option if you like a breakfast with lots of fresh fruits . i am not really a fan of the american style breakfasts here , and would recommend the waffles , pancakes and crepes over the bacon , sausage , and ham items on their menu . if you are craving bacon and eggs this is not the place for you ...
american	i could hang out here for hours and hours . i just wish it wasn 't in downtown tempe to where i have to worry about a dui ..... thanks uber ! ! !
american	what more could you need at cafe ? ! i 've only had breakfast here , but ever time i 've been quite satisfied with my meal and tea .
american	i 'm not sure i was a huge fan of the waffles . too cakey and was a bit too thick , but still good in little bits . overall good . wouldn 't mind going back to try other things .
american	i came here randomly with a friend a few months and i 'm so glad i did . i love the cute diner-feel of the place , reminds me of mel 's diner in waterloo . the breakfast steak is amazing here , so fatty and delicious . their home fries are also delicious ( i ask for them crispy cause who doesn 't like crispy home fries ) . i like how their portions are quite big and their prices are decent . their service has been friendly and fast the handful of times i 've been here so can 't complain about that . i 'll definitely be coming back !
american	cool , playful vibe , tasty food and friendly staff ... a fine addition to the madison brunch rotation ...
american	need a solid meal during breakfast grab a fried egg sandwich , comes with two eggs , bacon and this herb mayo that is so good . only wish is that they didn 't cook the egg over easy , when i asked for a more runny egg but that 's my only real complaint .
american	i love this place . everything from super healthy and delicious meal prep to yummy protein pancakes and bison burgers for cheat days . everything on the menu is so tasty and fresh . very reasonably priced for healthy food .
american	needless to say that i went on a wednesday to check this out . i have eaten at toast a couple of times before but have never been to their happy hour . i was impressed . they have $ 2 off glasses of wine ( including champagne ) and food specials . i enjoyed the beer braised wings ( you get 6 for $ 5 ) . other items enjoyed at my table were the burger ( marked down to $ 9 during happy hour ) , a cheese board and the tomato flat bread .
american	it was all great , small but good beer selection . $ 2.00 drafts on tuesday ! not a lot of bar crowd but great starter place .
american	the portions are adequate , but don 't expect huge portions . the menu changes each season to take advantage of what foods are fresh and readily available . the presentations are great , and the food is delicious . i usually order a fresh fish entree , usually salmon . however , on my most recent visit , i enjoyed a delicious halibut entree . seasons 52 gives you a selection of mini dessert indulgences that are served in shot glasses--just enough sweetness to enjoy at the end of your meal . seasons 52 has a quiet ambience and is a wonderful place to enjoy a meal and conversation with friends .
american	at first i was an unbeliever . i mean , how good can you make a haute dog ? i was blind , but now i see . just have a little faith ! i tried the classic texan ( chili + cheese + jalapenos ) and a gourmet pittsburgh ( coleslaw + smooshed pierogie aka pot-sticker wrapping ) . i liked the type of hot-dog buns used . it didn 't collapse or split under pressure . it must be a sin to make a hot-dog so divine . i slurped down the heavenly blue ( blueberry blackberry raspberry ) fruit shake very quickly .
american	in my previous review i was bummed that dollar beer night was done ... but in retrospect that was for one style of beer ( usually pilsner ) and after a few i was looking to try something else anyway . i guess change is good once you find the silver lining ! a friend got 12 wings , swimming , hot . i love hotter wings and these were in that ballpark .
american	what more can you ask for ! all dressed consists of mayo , pickles , lettuce , tomatoes , onions , mushrooms , ketchup and probably something i am forgetting .. i ordered fries but next time i will just order just a large burger ( two patties ) instead of a small burger ( one patty )
american	i 've yet to have a bad experience . expect highly concentrated coffee with good vibes . i get the carmelizer with almond milk given my lactose intolerance . long lines are to be expected at any dutch bros. if you 're interested , check out doordash , they will order the coffee for you and bring it to you - stat .
american	i 've visited several times and never had a bad meal . favorites include the shrimp and grits for breakfast and the blt with avocado , served with house-made potato chips . the grilled cheese with tomato soup is perfect comfort food and incredible if you step up and add some of their smoky thick bacon . the menu changes seasonally with items rotating in and out . plenty of vegetarian options for those so inclined . and brewed ice tea . the clientele is eclectic trending to hipster . parking can be tricky downtown and be prepared to feed a meter . and expect a wait if you 're trying for a weekend mid-morning breakfast . totally worth it .
american	i 'd say it was worth every cent . my husband ate the arizona filet mignon . it was a fantastic cut of meat but it was undercooked when asked for medium it was more like rare . i had the fettuccine pasta with tomato olive and spinach it was simple healthy and delicious ! i would say the overall experience was wonderful but i love eating at restaurants that use local vendors .
american	the service and food are great . i normally get the hot roast beef sandwich but honestly everything i 've tried there is worth having again . the only downside to this place is they 're not open on steeler sunday .
american	i tried the chicken francoise and it was the best i ever had - the chicken was cooked perfectly and the sauce was a perfectly made lemon bure blanc delight - i tried a few items and everything was perfect - the service was exceptional as well - i can 't wait to return !
american	personable and awesome ! ; ) will be back to try more food and beers - crack fries and muffin top burger rocked my word ! love the atmosphere ! ; )
american	he makes sure you are happy and full when you leave . breakfasts are amazing and i find myself actually craving the greek salad !
american	i didn 't know what to get so she kindly helped me juggle my options . i never been here before and as i 'm reading the receipt i understand the meaning of pdq . i can truly say that i am highly satisfied with the customer service i have received . ending my visitwith a friendly goodbye from kia . she asked me if there was anything else i needed making sure i was completely satisfied with my order . i really do appreciate how you guys made my night and on a good note . and another thing i love is that i see many african-americans showing quality service and running a really good business . thank you for making us look good pdq
american	have tried the cowboy burger twice which was great and the vegetable kale salad is outstanding ! !
american	the staff , particularly roseanne , are always welcoming and friendly ..... this is an exceptional place to grab something to eat or hangout with a cup of coffee . a wonderful addition to dormont and the south hills .
american	generous portions and tasty entrees . the prime rib is as good as the higher end restaurants her modestly priced . there 's no place that can compare to the flavorful wild salmon here at ellis island cafe not the bland farm raised junk so called salmon most other places have . enjoy a very good meal with a tasty homebrew or in house rootbeer at avvery modest price . we always have at least one meal here while in las vegas . enjoy !
american	$ 40pp for dinner , and there is a plethora of delicious foods to choose from . everything from rack of lamb ( tenderly prepared ) to kimchi ( not spicy , they probably don 't want to scare people away ) to chilean sea bass and alaskan crab legs . the dessert buffet is equally impressive from bananas foster , candied apples , strawberry shortcake , gelato , pecan pie ; all of it homemade and fresh . the wynn itself is very impressive with a mod 1960s decor ( think mad men ) . the floral arrangements alone are worth the visit .
american	our breakfasts of pancakes and eggs , including swedish pancakes were tasty and hot ! location is just across the street from the outlets at anthem and the prices were reasonable .
american	two had the lobster and declared it to be much better than while in s. f. one had the pre fixed meal for $ 39.95 and declared it to be a fantastic deal . i had the prime rib which was large & cooked to perfection . the service was fantastic . i have never experienced such polite & efficient service at any restaurant .
american	the owner and her mom were so friendly and informative . they gave great advice on what to try and the drinks they suggested were so eclectic , wow ! ! the only reason i don 't give it 5 stars is because the service was slow .... other than that the food was great and the experience was wonderful . i can 't wait to go back again .... what a cool place and all the different food was awesome . i highly recommend this place ........ it 's so nice to try new foods in place of traditional american foods like steaks , chicken. bbq , pasta , etc . oh yeah .... we ate outside ..... what a wonderful time ! ! ! ! !
american	the poitine atlas was prepared perfectly and was delicious . mom 's fiesta salad was beautiful . she loved it . dad 's western omelette was nearly inhaled . and , the eggs benedict were on par with much fancier restaurants . we will be back .
american	the consensus was that each was excellent . five star times four equals twenty stars . most impressive . the server , daniel , was highly attentive , cheerful and helpful . if you 're in the mood for a casual , moderately upscale experience of great fare with friends , this is a place you need to check out . we 'll be coming back .
american	this really is a great wee sandwich place and they are so nice and mix and match the sandwich fillings to give me more veggie options . and then top them off with fresh rocket and olives , delicious . oh and you must try the home made coleslaw which is pink from the red cabbage : 0 )
american	in haste i posted to the wrong " cabin coffee " so this review is up until i can delete it . i am sure that this place is wonderful .
american	the burgers are great , and their fries are the perfect combo to go with the burger . try the cajun fries if you like a little extra kick ! the restaurant was very clean and the service was also excellent . the food came so quickly and they clean up for you right away when you are finished .
american	service was great and food was even better . highlights were the pancakes and the tomato basil salad . highly recommend .
american	he did it again with vegeway ! finally a fast food restaurant for vegans ! he brought the amazing salads from his other restaurant . the burgers , fries and dairy free milkshakes are the best . you don 't even realize they are meat free . but chef , when are you gonna open something for the vegans in henderson ? ! ? !
american	as stated by those before me : 1 ) an absolute bargain when compared with what else is in the area ( after food court hours at miracle mile ) 2 ) 24 hours , a big plus . 3 ) fast service , friendly people ( as far as i 've encountered anyway ) 4 ) most importantly , delicious . as life altering as a fast food sandwich can possibly be . high marks on the club and tuna melt . the potato salad cup was decent as well . i 'd go out of the way to wind up here during the course of my vegas shenanigans , but it 's so centrally located that i usually don 't have to wander very far .
american	these are an absolute must try ! stopped in with the girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers and loved it . the decor reminds me of a typical family diner . very casual and very friendly . so , did i mention the cheese curds ? yeah they are awesome ! the place also serves up fresh oysters , fish fries , burgers , and more ! check it out !
american	i have long been a fan of the wbc-and though they took away the bread salad they used to have , this is still one fantastic place . the menu seems more complex than i remembered , but lucky for me , they still have my favorite sandwich on the menu . service was friendly and efficient . this location is still new , so i suspect they will get the flow of service and food execution down pat . lots more outdoor seating here then the deer valley location and i look forward to many more visits .
american	this place is pretty consistent , never eaten hear for lunch or dinner but it is a top 2-3 places for me to have breakfast . i also love the market store in front ... i always buy my stocking stuffers for the kids here every year .
american	go on line collect a $ 1.00 off coupon and head on over . lunch a little over $ 6,00 . plus some cookies for another dollar and you hit the grand slam with table service . can you tell i 'm not really a fast food person . what a bargain , baby ...
american	wife had veggy burger and top 5 veggie burgers i have tasted .. juicy
american	overall i like the place . i just had eaten so i didn 't order a meal . asked for a menu to check out the items and prices , they were currently out ; but staff said " i can check out everything online . " i not sure about the seating , seemed minimal . went back the next day and my wife was scared of the prices because she used to subway . don 't let the prices fool you , you get your monies worth . prime rib was cooked to perfection , bread wasn 't super thick like subway .
american	all i can comment on is how great the bobbie is as it is the only thing i 've ever ordered because it is sandwich perfection !
american	i was very happy with mayra helping us out ... all the food you could want and lots of options ! ! great food , great service and just a fantastic experience ! ! ! if you stay at the hotel you get 2 for 1 pass which rules and saves you 25 dollars ! ! ! !
american	i 've had breakfast once and brunch once and , each time , i was extremely happy with every facet of the place . the food is delicious . they have unique items and homestyle favorites , and wonderful specials . the service makes you feel like a welcome old friend , and the place just has a happy vibe to it . i will definitely be supporting this business and contributing to what i hope will be a smashing success in the pittsburgh restaurant scene .
american	the food is great , the best italian food i 've ever had , pizza is wonderful . anytime i 'm in las vegas i will be stopping here ! ! ! ! better food here than anywhere i 've been on the strip . a local friend told me about this place and i 'm so glad he did . with so many places to eat in las vegas you can get lost but this one is worth checking out . the place is always crowded so you got to expect to wait some but great food is worth it .
american	we never go to buffets but after seeing all the reviews i had to try this place . i was very impressed . the food was great and the staff was excellent . i really couldn 't have been more pleased from the crab legs to the hand carved slab bacon and unlimited champagne it was a awesome brunch ( and a great deal too ) .
american	being from nj we had know idea where to eat after going to nascar hall of fame . this place is 3 miles away and worth every bite . i had the mushroom burger and it was the juiciest burger i 've ever ate along with sweet potato fries and slamming good coleslaw . oh yeah and my ll teas is what the dr ordered . my waitress was super and we even went home with some badass tee shirts . i can 't wait to visit again .
american	they are so good , just like in new orleans . the crawfish in the soup etc. we 're way too small . the cocktails were solid , but over priced . would go back for the bbq shrimp !
american	everything is so delicious from the first bite into my burger to the bomb onion rings . this has to be the best burger i 've ever eaten . i got the brunchburger and the onion rings and man this place lives up to bobby flays name . i would have to give this place a 10 from start to finish . oh and you have to get the lemonade so good ! ! robby gave us a lot of tlc with that delicious lemonade she was so attentive to us . thank you bobby for opening this gem on the strip .
american	" the poutine , shrimp linguine , and chocolate ' 99 ' puck for dessert were absolutely amazing . also , we stumbled into the restaurant right before a local hockey game - which turned out to be one of the most fun experiences we had in toronto ! don 't miss this place !
american	there is nothing about the food or the service that particularly stands out good or bad . the brand mark on the bun is a cute gimic ... but the food is a tad bit pricey for what it is .
american	amazingly delicious ! friendly and incredibly attentive wait staff . nice trendy atmosphere . love the jazz music . we had the eggs benedict and southwestern omelet both were out of this world ! this place you don 't want to miss ! ! very reasonably priced too
american	some of the best bar food in the burgh ! ! the best ham and cheese sandwich i 've ever had , great wings , great burgers ! ! ! the mac and cheese was the only thing we didn 't care for , but bigham tavern is a favorite !
american	hands down the service was great and food delicious . this will be the only place for now on i go for burgers and dogs . and to remarks that they are kinda slow that 's because the cook you food fresh and make it with care . love it thank you .
american	nick which was i assume the manager and the hostess was so welcoming and checked on us at all times . the food is delicious . only thing as a warning the hash browns have oregano on them .
american	best food i 've eaten in awhile . great service and food was brought out by the chef himself . will def be back for seconds and thirds . and from the empty plates and the " oh my god this is amazing " from others around me i think they would agree .
american	burgers are delicious and cooked perfectly . the chips are incredible .. crisp and not too salty . fries are the same . don 't get the reviews that say music too loud and food salty . not the case . loved the whole experience ! person i was with said the onion soup was excellent as well .
american	excellent service , drinks , food selection , sand attention to detail . i am so impressed i may be back tomorrow morning for breakfast . they have any and every kind of dessert you could possibly imagine . their salmon is perfectly cooked and they have amazing veggie sand meat options . from 5-7pm y have aw drinks that are only $ 5 . dinner buffet is $ 38 , and i thought it was very reasonable for the options available . this should be on your list of places to visit for sure !
american	i could definitely say that it was one of the best burgers i 've ever had . unfortunately , not the ultimate best , but close . everything tastes fresh and juicy . the staff was extra friendly and hospitable . i would definitely come here again . food = 4 stars service = 5 stars
american	if there were a 10 star option i would select it ! ! ! ! this place really cares about their customers ( and the community ) ! super-fast service . delicious coffee ! i 'm proud to currently be their foursquare mayor !
american	my wife had peanut butter banana waffles with bacon in the batter . portions so big bring your appetite you will leave full and very happy .
american	i would come back in a heart beat . food , service , drinks , atmosphere everything was amazing . i recommend the rib cap , oysters , and pudding for desert . definitely a must when in vegas ! !
american	seriously , give us a chance . ask for me ! chef has created an outstanding eclectic menu featuring southern style cooking with international influences . i highly recommend the catfish served with a squash casserole ( inspired by chef 's mom 's home cooking ) and a creole style sauce , our " when pigs fly " pork flyte , now including chicharones , sweet chili pork shank , and tomato / bacon jam on grilled baguette topped with feta and fresh arugula . don 't forget about our house made tots , pretzels , and maple bacon brussels with dijon and fresno chiles .... to die !
american	truly from start to finish one of the best dining experiences i have ever had . why oh why did i just now make it to hugo 's cellar . my wife 's birthday dinner with another couple . the staff was a + . these guys are professionals . we are talking guys with 20 years working at the same place . michael & anthony treated us like we were the 4 most important people in the world.the food was supreme . the atmosphere is old school fine dining . it 's in the basement of the 4 queens downtown fremont street . would i go again ? anytime i can is the answer . a + + + + + + + +
american	we ordered the lamb & chicken gyro & also the philly cheesesteak & it was sooooo freaking good the best i ever had ! ! ! !
american	hot dogs were amazing , the fries where fresh cut , the atmosphere was friendly , great service and definitely a place to go back to again and again to try everything on the menu !
american	and also for a very good price ! it 's the place to find some zippy 's chili too by they way . = ) the other local hawaiian food on the menu is good as well . great salad bar . staff is always friendly . the only thing about this place is that the oxtail soup comes out only @ 11pm . would be nice to drop by anytime of the day to eat it whenever you want .
american	their fries are yummy and different as well , they have a delicious ranch dressing that i just want to dip like crazy . mmmmm juicy fresh made to order wings , they never let me down , have been here multiple times and always a success ! wingstop you rock !
american	just be prepared to wait a while to be seated and for the food to come out .
american	it was so delicious and tender . the hush puppies were a great surprise ... they were little jalapeno and cornbread bites of heaven . the chicken was also pretty damn delicious . my mom had the potatoes salad and she pretty much scraped the cup clean ... so i 'm sure she loved it . and last but not least , we experienced some of the best customer service i 've every encountered in vegas . rusty , the pit master , and the rest of the good folks here were super hospitable . they made us feel right at home . definitely coming back
american	the food is absolutely delicious . the premise is beyond all you can eat . it 's all you can eat meat ! top sirloin , filet mignon , lamb chops , pork loin , bacon wrapped chicken breast , and on and on . the salad bar is not your ordinary salad bar . no canned corn and peas here . fresh kale , hearts of palm , artichoke hearts , watermelon with feta . it 's it 's delicious and fresh and you ' [ ll want to go again but don 't ! the service was impeccable ! prompt courteous and ever so friendly . making plans to take the whole family .
american	all day , everyday . i want to try something else , but have been unable since this little ( ok , not so little ) gem entered my life . delicious . lovely atmosphere and staff , great place to bring out-of-town guests , your dog , or just yourself .
american	" everything that we ordered was truly divine . the orzo meatballs were to die for and the mozzarella was simple and fresh . the cookie platter was amazing . i loved the lemon ones the best . the restaurant 's decor is comfortable and inviting . it was like walking straight up to heaven as we climbed the stairs to the hostess desk . the service was amazing and the employees were very attentive and friendly . i loved the free photo booth as well . i can 't wait to go back when we visit vegas next month !
american	the ribs we 're fall off the bone tender and the mac and cheese was the best i ever had . my boyfriend was in heaven he said . we really enjoyed this place . not to mention the owner was right there working cutting meats saying hello people ! ! we will be going back again !
american	hubby and i stopped at sauceman 's on our way home from a relaxing trip to asheville , n.c. and i have to say we were pleasantly surprised by this place . don 't expect an elegant dining experience here , but rather good barbecue at a reasonable price . my only complaint is that they were out of a few items on the menu .... i was particularly disappointed that they didn 't have any barbecue chicken , but nevertheless the very friendly owner ( i believe ) suggested the sampler plate which was delicious and satisfying . when i 'm in the mood for barbecue , i will definitely consider a drive back to sauceman 's to get some .
american	i had just a classic burger came out in a tray ordered fries doesn 't come as a meal which sucks but the fries were okay nice fun clean atmosphere customer service was great ! will be back ! ! !
american	the brisket was tender and flavorful and the mac and cheese was to die for , the only downside was the string beans which weren 't seasoned enough for me and had a slight sweet taste . the staff was friendly and engaged with the customers . i will definitely be back soon ! ! !
american	my husband and i have been here on several occasions and have yet to be disappointed ! ! i 've tried , the crepes , the pate , the escargot , seared duck , cheese plate ... etc . it 's all good : - ) the service is always thoughtful and top notch ! ! this place is a hidden cozy gem !
american	there were 8 of us celebrating a friend 's birthday . the steaks are huge , the baked potato is enough for 2 people . i had clam chowder . really good . chris our waiter took care of us . will be back for sure .
american	i had the lunch special of st. louis style ribs , wilbur beans , corn on the cob , and a cornbread muffin . the ribs were definitely finger licking good as they melted in my mouth . the beans were savory and the cornbread had a sweetness to top off the perfect lunch / dinner ( would that be considered linner ? ) anyhow , if you like bbq and have never ate at famous dave 's , you do not know what you are missing !
american	the food was great , the service was great ! i got the 38 special omelette . it was huge ! i actually ended up taking half of it home . now i can say that was the first time i had leftovers from breakfast . our waitress jenn was excellent . she was very friendly and helpful . as were the rest of the staff . i highly recommend this place to anyone in the area . forget about the big hotel buffets , go to the omelette house ! one last word of advice , try the pumkin or banana bread .
american	oh how i wish we had a whataburger at home . i do miss this place . in n out burger has nothing on them . all other burger places are just burgers . whataburger is a little bit of heaven under a bun .
american	from the basic tryst breakfast to the hawaiian breakfast , it is excellent . fresh , delicious and unique . service is great as well ! i can 't wait to try the monte cristo . check out the menu online and go there . yummy !
american	food cooked to perfection . service impeccable . a must for any lover of seafood and italian . kurt was an excellent waiter making sure our wine glasses were never empty , our food was exactly how we ordered , and left us wanting for nothing . even though it isn 't close , i will make the drive for this place .
american	i found this place on open table the night before valentine 's day . what a find ! authentic cajun food with a new orlean 's environment . plenty of ambiance inside , but if the weather is accommodating , i recommend the patio----beautiful . the food was excellent , we were a party of 3 and each ordered something different , every dish was very tasty . waffles and chicken , strawberry and cream begniets ....... yumm .... excellent service and a bit of live music as well . i think of this place as a best kept secret----enjoy !
american	the fried chicken is mouth watering , the waffles are the best i have had , and the red kool aid is so damn good ! i don 't know how they make the red kool aid like they do , but it 's the best . the service is always friendly and fast , and i have ate here numerous times . i have never once had bad food or a bad experience . thank god i found this place in phoenix .
american	she recommended the appetizer drunken bread with prosciutto , and for dinner the red fish and spaghetti and smoked meat balls , and dessert was the expression creme brûlée . all the dishes showed the creativity of the chef and his crew . i would recommend this establishment to all . thanks for a great evening .
american	the food is amazing ! unique menu and daily specials that are always changing . very reasonable prices . and a great atmosphere ! really a great addition to pittsburgh dining .
american	the new management is amazing from the service provided for the take out order to the food ! we ordered two different types of skillet . the corned beef hash skillet was probably the best skillet i 've ever had . i will definitely be coming back . no idea why someone would go to ihop over this place being that they 're right next to each other !
american	had the roast beef , mushroom and fresh peppers , poutine and some great beer . took my wife and kids ( 5 & 6 ) they loved it . it 's a must . why are you still reading this . go , eat you will love the people and the food . go forth and eat ! ! !
american	i will be back every time i 'm in vegas ! i don 't review often , but this place got me to review because how amazing it was . employees were great , service was outstanding and the food was wonderful . i could eat there every day . i would recommend the burgers and shakes .
american	the omelet i had was absolutely delicious . great & quick service . comfortable atmosphere . very cozy . highly recommended
american	" this location is always fast and friendly . my experience here has always been walk-in to carry out . it is a busy location but the ladies have it all covered . the restaurant is clean , organized and smells sooooo good . church 's for those who don 't know is all chicken . fried chicken from on the bone to strips . along with traditional sides such as mash potatoes , fries , fried okra and much more .
american	we went for birthday dinner . fois gras cooked to perfection . short ribs tender an flavorful . bibb salad with chicken was fantastic , i 've never had a more tender flavorful chicken breast . definitely will be back ! !
american	the customer is what slows down the ordering process and by having it all at your disposable this place is pretty quick and tasty . the portion sizes are bit smaller than i 'm used to but personally i think they are the subway sinker . i kind of like to look at this place as a more efficient and tastier subway . i 've been here several times and i 'm slowly working down the menu . my personal fav thus far would have to be the gyro special . i work in the area so i 'll be here quite a bit !
american	even my daughter 's grilled chicken panini was on point , she ate all her chicken and feel asleep ! ! ; ) food is freshly prepared , even the salad dressing ! ! yummo ! ! ! ! ! !
american	all i can say is go to the happy hour great great prices you.gotta get the hot rocks food is good ask for the free bread killer ! ! ! !
american	the amount of hard work they put into preparing their food is clearly evident . completely fresh . i haven 't had anything like it before . i tried the roast beef brisket with caramelized onions ( $ 0.90 extra ) chipotle mayo , & black camel bbq sauce . staff is really really friendly !
american	i have had breakfast there 2 times and it was great both times . the bene 's are wonderful . my boyfriend thinks they are the best he has ever had . the grilled muffins are to die for .... a must try . the wait staff is friendly and efficient ! this place gets very busy but it is worth the wait . i will be in the tempe area soon and you can bet i will be there for another wonderful breakfast ! !
american	i haven 't had a really good meal in a while & thus place really won my heart . i got to pick my own lobster & it was so good , i didn 't need to use butter or cut into pieces . i ate the lobster in 4 bites . 2 × claw & 2 × body meat . i ordered my filet medium but came out medium rare . i was glad i didn 't send it back . an awesome experience ! ! !
american	( not all together though , you 'll explode ) i hate picnic food , but this place puts a spin on it that you wouldn 't believe . i practically go broke stopping here after work every day , but my job is so demanding that i fast all day ... it 's worth the wait ! and if you 're ever in a rush , order your food ahead of time and just pick it up ... then you don 't have to worry about waiting all day for your food at the high rush time ( around 11pm-1pm )
american	this place is awesome ! we had the club sandwich , shrimp mushrooms and canellis . our server didn 't try to up sell anything and gave us food to our liking . the beer and wine selection was good . i will definitely go back . only issue i had was it was a little spendy . all in all good though !
american	your stuffed peppers are the best ! ! actually everything is amazing ! ! the mac-n-cheese - that is a big omg ! i could go on and on but just go yourself , you will not be disappointed , i promise ! !
american	how much better can you get than being at a steeler bar on playoff weekend , watching your steelers kick miami 's butt with 100 's and i mean 100 's of steeler nation . it 's outside of phoenix in a place called cave creek which was cool just driving through . i seriously feel like i drove through the ok corral and it was awesome ! incredible views , great staff , excellent atmosphere , great food , they had an all-u-can eat buffet for lunch and the food was excellent . too any cool things to write about , it would take me all night ! go try it out whether you are a steeler fan or not !
american	i have seen this building go from kfc to guthries and now voodoo and had been hesitant to try them until reading the yelp reviews . we went for the first time tonight for my mom 's 95 th birthday .. yes she wanted wings . good prices , great customer servxieservice and the wings are unbelievable . fresh and hot , good portion not the wings had so much meat on them . fries were fresh and hot . sauces were delicious too , we had the garlic parmesan , sweet heat and teriyaki but they also tasted fabulous plain . we will , definitely return soon !
american	seriously so good ! ! good breakfast place with good prices .
american	nick , the owner greets you at the door with a smile and a sense of humor . that alone would get me to like the place . but , the food is amazing . i 'm not normally a breakfast person but i ordered the cali omelet with hash browns and i would go back tomorrow and have it again . the omelet was light and fluffy and the hash browns were the best i 've ever had . as a bonus , the service was top notch ! ! !
american	and only late night protein , this is the place to go . there 's not a lot of options cause everything 's pretty much just meat this meat that . you 'll see many body builders here . the price for the portions you get are unbelievable low . i was stoked that 13 $ got me an extra large plate of pork souvlaki which is a meal for 3 on it 's own . go here for late night protein at a great low price
american	) i love their fresh ground coffee / espresso / lattes . do not let the " wait " time scare you off ; they are so super fast and efficient . the weekend staff is amazing , especially danny who really takes the time to get to know all the regulars . i highly recommend butters to anyone in the area .
american	i sometimes just get the rice with eggs on the side instead of the omelet and that is delicious .
american	5 star stuff . go , its stellar ! national chain doing it right ! bravo !
american	food 's always a + but the noise from the gym next door gets really loud at times .
american	the fact that yu can see your food while it 's being made is a bit refreshing . at least you know where your food is coming from . downside is that food tends to disappear as soon as its put under the heat lamp . also the line reminds me of disneyland . it 's bad enough that the line is outside but it also zig-zags indoors . i paid around $ 11 for my meal because i added a drink to my lunch . other than the line and disappearing food , the food is pretty tasty . i suggest getting their sliders and fried chicken . also , you can never go wrong with a chocolate fountain . never .
american	the amount of options you have to choose from can 't be beat . and the food is restaurant quality . anything you try there you are guaranteed to like . the only thing i wish they worked on is the dessert . it was ok ... some of it appeared sophisticated but most of it was nothing special . of course i 'm not comparing wynn 's desserts to hometown buffet ... i 'm only comparing it to other buffets on the strip . they should look into what 's offered at paris if they want to steal all their customers : )
american	this food truck is amazing . i love lobster and eat it as often as i can , and i gotta say the quality is on the same level as a high end fine dining restaurant ( without the cost of course ) . i had the lobster tacos and the lobsters tots . the salsa in top was very delicious , with the cabbage slaw adds a great crunch . i loved the texture . i must say it is hard to find a perfect tater tots , as most are either not crispy enough or burned , but their lobster tots were perfect . i want more as i am writing this .....
american	they told us the wait would be an hour and we decided to wait because we had heard it would be worth it . we were seated within 15 minutes ! we ordered one of their specialties ( to share since we 'd heard about their portion size ) and it was delicious ! cannot wait to return !
american	got the apple pie - yum . definitely wishing i had one here ! the pies are huge , and usually i can eat a whole pie to myself , i only had a slice and i was stuffed . so delicious and it 's great that they 're open late for midnight munchies .
american	just try the corn dog . it 's so good ! their daily specials are pretty cool . unimpressed with their " poutine . " for example , the blt poutine was fries on top of a bed of lettuce ( who does that ? ) with some aioli drizzled over them and a few bacon and tomato crumbles . also , it gets very hot / stuffy in there !
american	based on only their burgers this place rocks . friendly staff , great portion size and clean environment . highly recommended .
american	easy place to meet friends , have a drink , watch the game or play curling .. : ) lolol yes , curling , inside the restaurant lolol ( you 'll find out when you go for a visit .. : ) great place and the food is good . : )
american	the steak is awesome , every dish i tried is perfect , and you get what you paid for ... the serving is really big ! ! ! ambience is perfect .... love their tomahawk steak ...
american	wonderful staff . one of the best places to go in madison on any occasion . barb
american	it 's a dinner with that old american midwest flavor . from the friendly personal service ( mary usually comes out and greets her guests . ) to the random coffee mugs , the home made bread and the jams all made in house that make you feel at home . i 've been going to mary 's for a long time and anyone i take with me just loves it . highly recommended . in my opinion . it 's the best breakfast in las vegas . kudos to mary for keeping it simple and keeping it fresh .
american	the service was steller the was great , however i would look into another process for cooking bacon , plated bacon drips with grease ! ! ! not good every other aspect is fine , again i must mention michelle again her constant smile and williness to make my stay pleasant is why i continue to have my breakfast at this market street location .
american	i 've gone more times than i can count for lunch and serioulsy loved both locations . my favorite is the grilled chicken & sage pesto but have also tried ( and loved ) tzatziki - humas - olives with pitas , white bean chicken chile , turkey , apple & swiss wrap & finally the apple & frisee slaw . oh and lets not forget about the sweet potato chips ! one downside is they charge you $ 5 to split plates ! seriously ? ! and that i 'm afraid is why they only get 4 stars from me .
american	the barbeque is the best and for the price .... we had dinner-1 / 2 slab and 1 / 2 chicken for 2 $ 30.00. it was great ! ! ! i will always return when i am i town .
american	please stop in and have an out of this world tasting chili dog ! i am so glad i found this joint .
american	" the menu ... extensive . food ... great . coffee ... fabulous . i had the " dutch baby " which was just great . tried a little of everyone else 's food and all was outstanding . my waitress , abby , was terrific . we need one of these in fayetteville .
american	" this place is amazing . i could not believe how delicious everything was . the service was impeccable . crazy expensive but for a one time experience it 's totally worth it !
american	absolutely the best chocolate pancakes ever ! also the biscuits and gravy are to die for . its a must go if your anywhere near . i will return for sure . the server ( sally ) was very personable and helpful . will ask for her section the next visit too
american	i absolutely love this place ! ! ! ! the sandwiches are delicious but the best thing on the menu ? the broccoli cheese soup ! ! ! its to die for ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! it cured my hangover super fast and it was the best soup ive ever had ! its one of the main things im looking forward to having when i go to vegas in a week ... im actually getting excited just thinking about having the soup ! ! = ) oh and if u have room after ur meal definitely try a icecream brownie sandwich its soooooo good but its very rich so its easy to share between 2-3 ppl
american	the first thing i had here after a friend brought me for a quick breakfast was the california club . it really was like a party in my mouth ! i 'm not kidding . everything on the menu looks so good i can 't wait to try it all . i 'm a little embarrassed to admit it but i have circled all the items that i really want to try on the menu and i 'm going through them one by one ( i 'm a total list crosser-offer ) . the last thing i tried there was " oatmeal our way . " which is actually not oatmeal at all , but so incredible !
american	traveling in vegas we stumbled on this place in henderson . i 've been to the hash house on the strip but didn 't know they had a second location . amazing good food and beverages . i don 't usually order breakfast but this was a real treat . it was hard to decide what to order because they have so many options . warning ... the portions are huge i will definitely go again and try something different . even though we waited a while to get our drink order it was worth it . just don 't be in a rush and enjoy .
american	wow , absolutely delicious , fresh , made to order food . super friendly and fast service , i am so impressed . i found a new favorite sandwich shop . and it 's right next to my hair dresser ! ! amazing ! ! ! large menus , definitely something for everyone !
american	very good gravy . service is excellent here too .
american	i promise it will not disappoint you in any way , it 's perf , okay ? best breakfast and brunch place ever to exist . better than ihop ? yes . better than denny 's ? uh , no shit . better than egg works ? hell yeah . better than the cracked egg ? don 't even , yes ! i highly recommend this to any breakfast / brunch persons cause you will not regret it . i was introduced to babystacks by an ex-boyfriend and that was probably the most amazing thing he 's ever done for me in our entire relationship . haha , seriously just go
american	so worth the wait when there 's a long line . was at the cal a week ago . it was a must have . if you haven 't tried it ... try it ! ! my girlfriend never had ox tail soup and was hesitant but my mom and i talked her into trying it , and now she can 't stop talking about it . and that was 3 yrs ago . will be back in august for more .
american	at first i wasn 't a fan of the fries but now i love them .
american	all i can say is , red robin , yum
american	they way the ribs fall off the bone is amazing .
american	and come here and eat . right now . very close to the food my grandmother cooked . best soul food in las vegas thus far . so happy and sooooo full !
american	hubby and i go to vegas at least once a year and always try new places to eat each time . we always rent a car and love to explore . the service was great , and the food was delicious ! i had the biscuits and sausage with gravy ( can 't remember the name of the dish ) and my hubby had one of the skillet breakfasts . yummo ! it was a lot of food and neither of us finished our meals , although i wanted to ! ! if you are looking to venture out from the strip i highly recommend . also , the price is right !
american	all i can say is that best steak house and best service in las vegas. guys if ur on ur first date take her to this place. she will be impressed. ps ladies get a free single long stem rose at the door
american	it is absolutely delicious ! ! but that 's not the only thing on the menu that is amazing . they have several delicious appetizers and entrees . their staff is incredibly friendly and fun . i haven 't had one server there that i did not love . i genuinely have a good time every time i am there because of the service . you are greeted and served quickly with little wait time at all . when there is wait time though , i recommended trying one of their delicious craft beers . they have such a unique take on food and beverages . i definitely suggest going here .
american	my son and i loved it . the toppings are fresh and the sauce is something that you 've never tasted from other pizzerias . the sauce is what makes a great pizza and fresh toppings and pizza pienza is the place ! if you want great pizza & wings come to pizza pienza you won 't be disappointed and worth every penny .
american	all i can say is that i risk there was one in the northwest arkansas area ( home of wal-mart ) and a fast growing area .
american	a level of food dining that you will not get just anywhere . the service was a little abrupt but it was attentive . they were very busy on a wednesday and suspect that kept or wait staff from being more engaged . the dirty martini was the best i have had in a very long time . the choices were accessible yet exotic and just pulled off perfectly . very glad i got to try this culinary experience .
american	it was buttery , melt is your mouth goodness , served on a hot plate so that every single bite was hot . not such a big fan of the cream spinach though . i thought it was very bland in taste . i 'd go there just for the cheesecake . it is dense but very light in taste with a coat of sour cream on top . i 've been there twice and each time our service has been excellent . i would recommend this place to anyone .
american	the decor / atmosphere is very nice , the service is truly top notch , and the food was downright amazing ! there were four of us at dinner and we all absolutely enjoyed our food . i enjoyed the 1 / 2 portion creamy artichoke soup & 1 / 2 portion special heirloom tomato / melon salad , the lobster & tarragon pasta with fresh vegetables and the rhubarb parfait ... with a little rose champagne as well . we also tasted the trout and green bean salad , the scallops , the halibut , the cheese sampler and the peach dessert - again , all fantastic ! truly a fantastic dining experience !
american	the pita is stuffed with yummy gyros and all the fixings ! the fries are always so hot and crisp ! we have seen other dishes that people have ordered and they always look so good ! since i don 't get to come here as often as i like , i keep getting the same thing ! one of these days , we will have to try something besides the gyros ! : -d by the way , the people who work here are super friendly ! they always come by and check to make sure that we are happy with the food and to see if there is anything we need .
american	i 've never been disappointed and love the atmosphere and fresh ingredients . the best part about eating here is that i don 't feel bogged down and tired after i eat here like i do in other restaurants which i really appreciate .
american	super good garlic knots too . service is good . it 's located inside the four queens . if you can 't find it just ask one of the staff . i was hungry and after i ate , i wasn 't . that is all .
american	is there anything else a restaurant really needs to do besides having those three things ? i stopped by on my drive home from work and decided to order a cheeseburger . the burger was delicious perfectly cooked through and assembled well together along with the special purple kopol sauce . the fries were pretty awesome too as they were extremely crispy and came with a nice seasoning . the inside of the place was extremely clean and modern looking . there is no reason anyone shouldn 't give this place a try .
american	my bf and i always eat here . we usually get the shrimp or crawfish with the hot & juicy sauce , which is so garlicky. lol then we overload it with lemon . omg pretty bomb . it does get a little messy so i usually don 't recommend getting all dolled up to eat here . can 't really say anything bad about this place . well just the fact that it gets crowded but it 's understandable ' cause it 's hella good here ! also , it 's kinna hard to find parking sometimes . in my opinion , this place is better than boiling crab .
american	lasagna is bomb ! ! ! spaghetti is perfect no to saucy but just right ! ! ! lobster tail and cannoli are sooooooo goooood ! ! i wish there was in la ! ! ! !
american	i had the chicken burger and zucchini fries with the banana cream pie for dessert . i thought i had died and gone to heaven eating the pie and i don 't even like banana cream pie ! plus you get a quarter of a pie for your slice so it 's big enough for two ! service was great too ! will definitely keep going back !
american	.. we ordered from the lunch menu and got the chicken waffles and also the special big o 'crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin sandwich and omg ! ! ... each plate was like a planet . admittedly i have had better chicken but that doesn 't mean i don 't drool at the thought of having it again . our waitress was fonda and i tell you , she has definitely raise the bar on what is crazy excellent service . even though she did have many tables to attend to , it still felt like she was your personal waitress and always had a huge smile on her face . her service definitely made the whole experience at this place .
american	grew up in the quad cities and we missed it so much ! what a treat !
american	i 've pretty much been to all the high end steak houses in la and sd area . i 've tried other cuts , but the skirt steak is the best . the grilled ribeye is pretty good as well . the yukon gold puree is also very good .
american	im just saying that when she 's at work she 's always makes the decision to eat at dennys over ihop which is down the street . seem like the best decision made in deciding where to eat . my order is always just how i orderd it and she acts as if i 'm important to her .
american	we ended up going a couple times when we needed a snack or it was a little later and everything else was closed . everything we tried was excellent . great quality food and flavor and such great prices ! they are open 24 hours , which sometimes can mean less quality food and that is not the case . definitely will be back the next time i am in vegas .
american	wow ! the chicken was excellent and super juicy ! the burgers are great and so was the chicken salad on the cucumber ! if you come during lunch be prepared to sit along the window or outside .
american	hubby and i went for dinner last night . it was a lovely evening , so we got to sit outside on the patio . our waiter , shane , was very attentive and personable ! i got the risotto special that had rich , perfectly seared scallops and lots of fresh vegetables ! it was so creamy and savory , i loved every bite ! and luckily i brought home leftovers for another enjoyable meal ! my husband had the monkfish special which was over potatoes and vegetables . he really liked it as well ! staff is wonderful and the menu is amazing ! we are definitely going back and we don 't eat out that much !
american	the beef ribs were tender and the hot links had a good kick to them ! the service was great and the food was amazing ! will definitely come back for more whenever i 'm in town .
american	so creative and so delicious . i have eaten there many times and have been wowed every time . warm , friendly wait staff too ! you owe it to yourself to visit .
american	prices are reasonable , i mean why would you go to some fast food chain when you can have a lunch like this . everybody is always so friendly and they keep the place spotless.my favorite item on the menu is the chicken cutlet , but everything is good . something as simple as a blt was the best i have ever had . a must go , you will not be disappointed .
american	it was " expensive , " but the food and ambience was truly " out of this world " ! !
american	" 5 star food , 6 star location / scenery , just an incredible dining experience for a crisp , sunday morning . yes you have to get your own water / coffee and yes the service is a bit inconsistent . if you can 't get past that , then i recommend denny 's . they 're all over the place . if you can dig a relaxed pace in a very serene , almost bucolic setting in the middle of the desert with the best monte cristo i 've ever had , then head over to morning glory . can 't wait to try the dinner restaurant .
american	amazing burger & exceptional service . it was really crowded so i sat at the bar . courtney waited on me & she was very attentive . i 'll be back next time i 'm in town
american	we tried a few different things and all was extremely good . lexi our server was a rock star , very helpful and was always smiling . the hanger steak was melt in my mouth good . we will definitely be back .
american	amazing food ! huge menu and all vegan ! philly cheese steak is my favorite , can 't believe its not meat . from quesadillas to shawarma .. rich with protein and low cals . can 't go wrong
american	amazing food ! one of the best steaks i 've ever had . the potato purée , corn and mini shiitakes were also great . for dessert i had the cookies and cream ice cream and coconut sorbet . both delicious . we were quite full after the meal as the portions were pretty big . the server ( lesean i think ) was helpful and attentive . always made sure we had full glasses . the gm came over to make sure everything was good . very sweet lady ! nicely decorated interior . price was high , but i wasn 't expecting anything other than that . would definitely return !
american	at first my boyfriend and i were very hesitant to try a new restaurant , but when we got here we loved it . the staff is so friendly and wonderful ! big thanks to the manager , gm , and even more so shelby our waitress . she took such good care of us with amazing customer service ! 20 / 10 would recommend to anyone ! the food was great and so were the people and the prices ! ! thank you guys so much ! !
american	awesome food . great service . the beer selection and variety is sweet ! ! delicious food . don 't pass this place up . unique food with unbelievable flavors . it will definitely be on your favorites list .
american	biscuits are on point ! ! the chef and jeremy were both awesome and even gave us a free yummy cauliflower app for free while we waited for fresh biscuits ! this place is dope !
american	definitely hit this spot . you 'll need reservations but well worth it ! we arrived , were seated immediately , staff was very attentive , offered us the specials of the day . we decided to go with the surf and turf , my wife went with the veal ... the wine selection was excellent . our meals were cooked to perfection ! usually when you get a surf / turf its a small " surf .. " this was so large i was full after wards , couldn 't even put down desert .... definitely going back again ... highly recommended ! ! ! ! !
american	extremely friendly staff and amanda was my server . very friendly and put me in a good mood and not only was the staff awesome but the food was great . i got the eggs benedict florentine and it was excellent . highly recommend this place .
american	first time visit , , i had the corned beef swiss omelet awesome ! ! ! real corned beef brisket slow cooked for 8 hours delicious ! ! ! ! i went with my boyfriend who is sometimes picky and a critic of foods because he is a cook guess what he loved it ! ! ! ! super friendly people who work there everyone made you feel like you were a part of a big family highly recommend ! ! ! ! we will be back
american	friendly service and even better food . this is my first time here and i love cajun food. everything has exceeded my expectations . plenty of food , everything by the pound . i will be going back again and i suggest you check it out when ever you 're in the tempe , az area .
american	i ordered the brown sugar and banana pancake and yes it was awsome . filled the entire plate , me and my wife had to share it . bacon , thick and cooked just crispy enough , and the chicken and waffles succulent and worth every dime .. if you find yourself close to this location , stop by and try everything !
american	from the moment we walked in the service was excellent and the food fantastic . we will definitely return upon our next trip to las vegas .
american	from the views - to the food - to the service ! ! everything was spectacular ! i dined up here with my husband and 2 year old son for breakfast and my server , diana , came out with the cutest mickey mouse pancakes for him ! it was so adorable and my son loved it . huge mickey mouse fan . how did she know ? ? the manager , whitney , came by to check on us which is such a nice touch . sweetest lady ever ! i grabbed their lunch and dinner menu which look well priced and with lot of variety . we will definitely come back ! !
american	great ambiance , the hh mimosa was fabulous , i 'm not even going to talk about the waffles and chicken .
american	great new bbq place near my home in matthews . just across from the siskey ymca . i was greeted by 2 smiling faces at the door . then my waitress ... i think her name was caroline , was helpful in helping me navigate the new menu . i had the big q so many could try everything ... i loved the brisket and the pulled pork the best but the short ribs and chicken were a close 2nd ... the onion rings and pickles were good too . look forward to bringing my friends back to the q ...
american	great place . service is incredible . food is incredible . they 're super accommodating . if i could give six stars i would . the omelette i had was amazing . they somehow get them fluffy and not too heavy . highly recommend . i chose roasted garlic , toasted almonds , and grilled asparagus . the balsamic reduction on top was delicious . hash browns are homemade and top notch . my wife got the melt away and it was equally delicious . the veggies were really good . orange juice is fresh squeezed and tastes like heaven . i cannot recommend enough .
american	great service , great food , friendly faces . a rare pleasure for sure . i had the french dip with onion rings ... they we 're good but make sure you let them know how long to cook the beef . overall , i 'm definitely coming back .
american	great staff and great service . my recommendation would be the cuban pork belly with hash browns and eggs benedict .
american	i always wondered when i watched diners , drive-ins & dives if this " guy " was the real deal ... he is . they should feature this restaurant on the show . here 's what we had , and they were all very tasty : tuna tacos , truffle fries , the fondue , asian chicken wraps , brisket nachos ( these are awesome ! ) . go there hungry and order a la carte so everyone can sample . great food , good staff .
american	i am a very picky fried chicken person--- mrs. white 's is hands down the best chicken i have ever had ! ! love it ! the mixed greens for my side were also very yummy ! i 'll be back often , thanks to the awesome staff that made my visit absolutely heavenly ! : )
american	if you at at the venetian you got to come here . the swine burger is 100 % belissimo .. can 't say enough my no . 1 fav burger ever even over the sunrise burger at lumberyard .. sorry lbc they just stole it . fine menu of local craft beers and the salads are optimal . they are a southern based culinary hangout chicken and waffles mac n cheese but i 'm tryin to be good here and split a burger and salad . as they go by i 'm like wow that looks delish ! ! ! deviled eggs are hit in this pace too and the green fried tomatoes ... worth every cent all of it
american	i had a manhattan and an old fashion . perfect . to say my wife and i shared the creole bbq shrimp and the charcuterie . the house also have is an incredible shrimp dish they are thinking of for the menu . everything was superb . and the service was devine .
american	i had an incredible 12 oz tenderloin . it was extremely thick but they managed to cook it perfectly . lightly crusted shell and medium rare was not overdone in the slightest . practically melted in my mouth . pretty reasonable prices ... 35-45 bucks for such an incredible steak is great .
american	i haven 't had food this great in a while ... i was so not expecting the food to be this amazinggg ! ! i got the aioli with roasted tomatoes burger , gooey fries and a cookies & cream and creme brûlée shake . everything so tasting and left me without words .
american	i really have no words to best describe this place , the best applebee 's so far , customer service is 5 stars i have been on $ $ $ $ restaurants in nyc and have not received this type of service ......... if you ever come here and see this dude with a mr. jackson name tag this guys is the freaking best ! ! ! ! ! recommend to everyone ! ! !
american	it is about time that a bbq that cares about their product opened up on the westside . tried the brisket ( fatty version ) , ribs , beans and mac and cheese . all were outstanding . if you are not into a healthy portion of fat , make sure to order the regular brisket . ( yes you have a choice ! ) sauces were good , sides were good , service was good albeit a little bit of a wait for the good food to arrive . skip the chains , this is the real deal .
american	" i tried these guys because they had a booth set up at denim and diamonds . oh my .... i am so glad i tried the brisket sandwich . it was warm drippy barbecued delightfulness ! i highly recommend a trip to this eatery . you will not be let down . i would drive from tempe , chandler , or even scottsdale for another sandwich !
american	it 's safe to say that this is some of the best food i have ever had & the restaurant is beautiful . my boyfriend and i come here every year for our anniversary , the last time we were here he had the alaskan halibut which was cooked perfectly & i had the rosemary capretto also very delicious . if you enjoy great food i strongly recommend you give this place a try .
american	i 've been wanting to come here for some time and am so glad i finally made it here . i love the open atmosphere of this palce . plenty of indoor and outdoor seating . the happy hour prices on drinks and appetizers you can 't beat. ex . a pitcher of beer for 6 bucks and not just the domestic beer . i had the brisket sandwich ...... simply delicious with the jalapeño cole slaw . this is a must if you haven 't already tried ohso .
american	i was in vegas for many reasons and i wont get into them here , but this restaurant was amazing. the food was outstanding the the service was the best i 've ever had . the atmosphere was very relaxing , and non pretentious . the appetizer that we had was fantastic ! go prawns ! and the steak was to die for . the several waiters that attended to us were extremely knowledgeable and the sommelie was top notch . if you ever get a chance to visit this place i highly recommend it ! emerile did a great job with this one .
american	stopped in for dinner with my girlfriend and we were greeted right away . place had decent dinner crowd for 6pm . we both had side salads to start and it was good . dressing was lite and greens were crisp . i ordered the chicken quoba with spinach rice and naan . it was spectacular ! my girl had the afghani meatballs with white rice and garlic naan . she loved it ! ! ! this place gets 4 thumbs up from us and we will definitely be back ! ! !
american	just wow . we had multiple small plates and they were all amazing . our favorite of the evening was the bolognese . they were out of a few dishes as we were later in the evening , but they were quick to apologize and make it up to us . service was beyond excellent and the atmosphere sublime . what a treat ! we will be back , even though the drive was 30 mins from charlotte .
american	loved the ambiance . the service was that of a five star establishment . the food was sooooooo good . they have something for anyone and everyone while keeping a simple menu as to not be overwhelmed with options . i drove about 20 minutes from my home to try this place out and will become a regular from here on out . do yourself a favor and trust me on this one you won 't regret it .... try this place out ! ! ! ! ! !
american	my husband and have been here a week eating at 5 star restaurants and none of them have compared to this ! we were walking to the mgm pool and decided to stop so we didn 't have to eat food by the pool . " food snobs " the flavor in the food is definitely there ! the best buffalo wings we have ever tasted and the turkey burger and kale salad are amazing ! ! mike is a great server too . eat here you will not be disappointed .
american	" my husband is from chicago and we were uncertain how close these vienna dogs would come to the " real thing . " we went with family and shared several dogs including the polish dog , vienna dog , carolina , and chili cheese dogs . all of them were excellent . the owners made a point of visiting our table while we were there , which made a great impression . this is the best place to visit when you 're craving a good dog !
american	our server was very knowledgeable and eager to find the answers to our questions . the atmosphere is lovely , very chill , i could stay there all day . ( try to find all the pigs ) i can 't wait to try out the patio when it gets a bit cooler . the owners make your experience a personal one , which is always great . all t he food we had was amazing ! beats and garlic appetizer , chicken , ribs and red pepper cannelloni 's . price may be on the high side but it 's so totally worth it ! i 'll be making repeat trips back !
american	outstanding grass fed burgers , the veggies with hummus and this spicy pumpkin seed dip was delicious if you eat the raw red bell peppers with the pumpkin seed dip , it 's a taste explosion of yum ! great experience , great staff , will definitely be back .
american	that , and i can 't believe i waited so long to check this place out . the service was terrific- our server knew her stuff backwards and forewords ! our order was perfect and the presentation was outstanding ! i 'm a carnivore pure and simple and have lived in dallas and atlanta- home to some of the best steakhouses in america and strip blows them away ! go and enjoy- eat , drink and love all that life has to offer at strip !
american	the chicken is fresh and hand-battered and my husband raved about the fries . we will definitely be back in to have more when we go west .
american	the decor and vibe is perfect . ownership knocked it out of the park again . it 's monday night and there is a wait which i am happy about . this space has seen many start and fail restaurants . we started with the artichokes which were pure amazing . i washed it down with the crab cakes and wow i was very happy . i know that everyone was happy with dinner . in to desert . chocolate chunk cookies on a wood plank served with house made chocolate milk . yep ! ! !
american	the food was amazing ! we had the whole wheat penne and the orecchiette with italian sausage . really good . we also split the nutella cake with salted carmel ice creme . one of the best deserts i have had .
american	the food was great very large portions and it was very tasty food ! ! we enjoyed it for visiting las vegas ! awesome job here
american	the meat was amazing . we got the sampler plate for 4 and i 'm so glad we did so we could try everything . it was all delicious . the deviled eggs are expensive , but totally worth it . it was empty on a friday night , so i hope it will continue to make it . don 't let that deter you !
american	the owner greets you at the door and makes you feel like your a regular . the food is excellent as are the prices . we might end up eating only at this place during our vacation . thanks mr mama !
american	the poke ahi tuna ceviche w / pineapple and jalapeño was incredible , as was the beet salad with goat cheese and pistachios and the steelhead trout with carrot and maitake mushrooms in a citrus sauce . then , the chocolate peanut butter pretzel dessert ( and the 6am special w / french toast and bacon ice cream , which i got to sample from a friend 's plate ) were amazing . lastly , the wines by the glass were solid - i had the 2007 damiano barolo . 5 stars - there is a reason why this place was full along a street of mostly empty restaurants and bars !
american	-the restaurant was very clean ( big plus in my book , i loathe filthy restaurants ) -our server was wonderful -they have a build your own mimosa bar ! - chicken cherry sausage ( made in house ) -the best shrimp and grits ever ! ! ! ! seriously , you can 't go wrong with anything on the menu . everyone i was with enjoyed their food . i will definitely be back !
american	this buffet has everything you can imagine food wise . we went for a bottomless mimosa buffet . the service was really good . the chefs were very attentive to dietary needs and other requests . the atmosphere is very nice . weekdays are less crowded and excellent for brunch .
american	this is definitely the best pizza i 've ever had ! the atmosphere is very nice and pleasant . the service is great , and the thin crust margherita pizza is absolutely delicious ! ! i will be coming here a lot more ! !
american	this is friggin good ! pros : great food great service moderate prices cons : long wait time ... not sure that can be considered a con since long lines mean that alot of people like this place .... i am no exception to the rule , i actually ate here twice within 4 days . some tips : you have to try the crawfish in the hot and juicy sauce , medium ! it has just the right amount of spice . this is a really a one of a kind experience . word to the wise , do not wear white ! ! definitely worth the trip if you 're out in vegas .
american	this is some of the best chicken fingers i have ever had . the place was clean , fantastic and the food was excellent . keep it up !
american	this place is just the perfect brunch . tucked away in scottsdale behind the pasty co . we had the pancakes , omelette , ans curried rice . the pancakes were mosit a s fluffy , the compote had a harmonious blend of flavor , the curried rice was the best i 've ever had . the omlette was just amazing especially with the breakfast potatos , i high recommend to anyone looking for the perfect breakfast , brunch , lunch spot .
american	this restaurant delivers a little taste of home in the desert . being from the detroit area , i was skeptical of how well they would portray this detroit tradition . the chili was spot on . the hot dogs were just as good , if not better , than what you get back home . and the ' hani ' was better than most in michigan . the owner ( dave ? ) was very welcoming and passionate about the business . overall , great experience . they surely brought pure michigan to the valley .
american	this was my first time here . our server sy was amazing ! such great service and very attentive . the food was the best breakfast i 've had in a very long time . i recommend this spot if you love great customer service and excellent breakfast food !
american	this was the best food i 've ever tasted ! i ordered the brisket trash can nachos , and the bacon mac and cheese burger . they both were bursting with flavor ! i could instantly taste how fresh and delicious every single ingredient was . i even give their ranch dressing 5 / 5 ! the atmosphere was awesome ! i had so much fun in the restaurant i literally left with a huge smile on my face ! i also bought two bottles of guy 's brown sugar bbq sauce that was on the brisket , i can 't wait to blow my friends away when i cook ribs with it later this week ! thanks for an awesome experience !
american	" top of the world is expensive - and worth every penny . my wife and i had a dinner reservation for sunset and are still talking about how wonderful the experience was . the staff were extraordinarily professional and attentive . the food was awesome - including the desserts . i highly recommend this restaurant for a classy romantic and memorable dinner .
american	went here with a group of 5 girls and everyone loved their meal . the waiter was fantastic . for me , the biggest attraction was listening to the waiter describe the choices on the menu : everything sounded incredible !
american	we tried their buffet and it was pretty darn good at this place . but 777 kicks ass . i had the philly steak sandwich which was a grilled hoagie bun with yummy mozzarella cheese i asked for no bell peppers and extra onions and a steak sandwich was so huge i had a hard time picking it up . i had garlic fries and my girl had the flatbread with meat lovers that was like a huge pizza it was so yummy licious recommended all the dishes that came out looks wonderful . our server lori she was a great server and work her ass off for us
american	what a great find and great bbq . the hot link sandwich is amazing . the staff is very friendly . food came out quick . i must for all bbq lovers .
american	what an excellent place for top notch pizza and salads . all healthy and freshly made right in front of my eyes . also this the cleanest place i have ever eaten at . in my opinion any review other that 5 stars is ridiculous . i 'll be back again and again !
american	when you see the generous portions and try the food ... you 're gonna say the same thing " wow " ! ! ! this place gets very packed and you might end up waiting anywhere between 20-45 mins for a table , but it 's totally worth the wait . if there is an open chair at the booth , you 're welcome to sit there and have your meal . my wife ordered the chicken & waffles and i had the andy 's sage fried chicken benedict and both dishes were off da hook delicious ! ! ! we 're coming back for sure !
american	while visiting in az stopped in for a late lunch , shared a stir fry veggie bowl with tofu , it was delicious ! ! ! the cocktails are even more amazing , had the skinny margarita with slices of fruit ( cucumbers & oranges ) so refreshing . my daughter had the cucumber martini which was even better then my drink . i could have stayed and just drank cocktails all afternoon . uber cool hip healthy food restaurant . i can 't wait to go back next time i 'm in town . kudo 's to az for it 's great healthy restaurants .
american	wow on their service ! ! wow on the friendliness ! ! and wow on their food ! ! ! ! i threw my sister a baby shower in the garden and they were amazing ! ! i want to thank them for all they did the weather was off so they inside prepared for us just in case we wanted to go inside . if i ever throw another party it will for sure be there ! ! thank you again philip , christian and your beautiful mom and staff !
american	number one the selection and quality of the burgers was absolutly amazing . number two the selection of beer was huge . they carried beers ive never seen at restaurants before . the waitress was extremely nice and kinda reminded me of michael jackson which made the experience even more enjoyable . but seriously this place is a must . i had the blackjack burger and mmmmm . the only downside is that the place is so nice and enjoyable you kind of wish it was fancier . i 'm serious try this place an you might have to come back multiple times on your trip .
american	i haven 't had good wings like this in a very long time . my husband and i can not stop craving these wings ! we live in ca and are seriously considering driving out for some wings and fried pickle spears ! not only is the food good but service was great as well . my husband ordered scorching and hot wings . sadly they where out of scorching but .. they made a special sauce for him and he loved it . i ordered bourbon and honey heaven . i almost cried when they where gone . we will definitely be going back soon ! ! !
american	i was hesitant at first to try it out because the thought of chicken with waffles .. and syrup poured over didn 't sound too enticing but holy cow ! i crave it everyday now ! i need my chicken and waffles with the purple drank ! !
american	i loved it so much the first time , i went back the next day . both times i got the veggie pita . the flavor and texture of the veggies were amazing ! the vegetables were perfectly grilled and juicy , the tzaziki was delicious and the wheat pita was nice and soft . the fries actually had flavor and came with a yummy spicy sauce . the baba ghanoush was good as well . not my favorite type , but still good . they have tons of vegetarian options which helps a lot because i don 't eat meat . i can definitely be a regular here !
american	their steak sandwich is great . done to perfection , juicy , tender and delicious . there were 6 of us and the only glitch was the schnitzel sandwich . small on a big bun . disappointed to say the least . other than that we had a great meal and good time . waitress was really nice and attentive but not hovering . we 'll be back for sure
american	my fiance and i are new to charlotte so this was our first try at true southern style soul food . mert 's was not a disappointment . the service was friendly . very cozy southern feeling atmosphere . very casual and chill and best of all , not overpriced ! biggest recommendations : the cornbread is to die for ! ! ! omg ! the chicken is wonderful and the mac and cheese is soooo good ! definitely worth checking out !
american	food was delicious and the hanna nut muffin was to die for . super banana-ey ! carole ann , our server , was great ! if you 're staying on the strip , it 's so worth the 10 minute drive !
american	great food , great service . great atmosphere . great decor . and unique in an awesome way ! if your in scottsdale and craving seafood or ribs or pulled pork or corn or mac don 't miss it ! !
american	i came for the breakfast and it was delish ! such a warm cozy restaurant . the 45 minute wait was the only downside . but i 'd highly recommend it if you looking for a great brunch .
american	my husband and i love going here for date night . the good is great and so is the service . and , as a bonus , we get coupons in the valpak envelopes that come in the mail every month for " buy one , get one free " meals . it doesn 't get much better than that .
american	so happy my fave chicago place is here ! yummy deep dish ! cheese on cheese on cheese ! first time coming and great service : ) manager walking around checking on everyone ! it does take 45 min for the pizza to come ( the serve let 's you know that when you order it ) so worth it ! some things are a little different form the ones in chicago-but still amazing ! it 's hard to have the same pizza out here when it 's not chicago ! cool fact they did tons of tests to get the water as close as possible to chicago water-so that it tastes as amazing as chicago ! great place !
american	the food , service , and atmosphere is amazing . i could eat there everyday . i have been to a lot of pita jungles , but this one is the best !
american	polynesian food and breakfast with an american punch ! seriously the only downfall is the size of the resteraunt ! it 's always packed so come about 1 hour before you are actually hungry ! i had the eggs benedict and lemon ricotta pancakes and i was in heaven ! ! ! i always recommend baby stacks when family comes into town ! ! !
american	some friends and i met here for happy hour before a concert and it was amazing . none of us could decide what to order so we got a bunch of appetizers off the hh menu and a large salad . delish ! it was also extremely reasonable . it 's been sad watching restaurant after restaurant fail in this space so really hope this one takes . the ambiance and food are perfect so hope it 's a home run for them . i know i 'll be going back as much as possible .
american	they catered our job on food truck day and their chicago hot dog on a pita was delicious . plus they serve coke in a glasses bottle and poore brother chips ! what could be better ? staff was also very nice and fast !
american	wear a shirt you don 't care about and get ready for the real nitty gritty cajun seafood with an efficient staff.can 't wait to come back !
american	went here for happy hour and the deviled egg dip appetizer is amazing ! they also have an awesome drink selection . came back for lunch and then brunch and loved the crab cake eggs benedict . hands down the best eggs benedict in arizona . also tried the brown bag chicken sandwich and it was solid too . never have had anything here that wasn 't outstanding . give it a try !
american	we ordered the following for dinner & it was wonderful ! friendly and prompt service . great atmosphere + modern decor . we 'll definitely come back for more . - iron skillet mountain trout - i loved it ! - wood roasted avocado toast - my husband enjoyed this . - bbq carrots - to our surprise , this was so flavorful . - carolina gold rice grits - super creamy . i can just eat this alone and be happy ; ) - the doughnut $ 18 ( note : this can honestly feed an entire village ! my husband and i did our best & finished half )
american	you really can 't go wrong here . the atmosphere fits the cuisine and i loved all of it . ( okay except for the sauteed squash but this is no biggie ) . the fried chicken , beef ribs ( which i don 't ever eat ) , sweet tea , cornbread , potatoes , and on and on are fabulous . so tasty ! of course there is no calorie-counting here but it 's a great experience that makes you feel good .
american	i also love to see certain people load their plates so full the food falls on the floor and they pick it up and consume go on sunday after church and they have dresses that glitter and men have bright colored suits . it 's better then star treck
american	the burgers are great they are fresh and not frozen also all beef . the fries can come with cajun spice one it ( highly recommended ! ) . while you wait they offer free peanuts , free is always great . price is reasonable and quantity is great. the little fries on the menu is like jumbo fries as they top it up . watch out : not a place for peanut allergy folks as there are peanuts in the restaurant .
american	: ) i got the meatball pizza . yes ! parking was not bad , service was good , no asking for refills , and we had a corner table so it was not loud and i can hear my fellow foodies ...
american	ask your server for suggestions . i ate whatever was ordered and it was delicious . i love the setting of their setting and atmosphere , service was prompt or maybe because the group i came with was highly important but who cares . hands down to jaleo and the awsome food .
american	this place has both . everything is fast-paced and the staff are friendly . pancakes were a stack of three in the combo and homemade delicious . definitely check it out !
american	awesome food , awesome customer service and staff . i loved my mimosa , loved the suggestion for my crabby omelet , and my boyfriend enjoyed his hearty man breakfast loaded with carbs and meat ! we 'll be back soon !
american	the lobster and shrimp with potato , corn and sausage was also cooked well . the butter seasoning was great . i would ask for extra butter seasoning for the potato . remember cash only , order on the other side of the bar when you enter , and keep your receipt to pick up the food .
american	you better arrive hungry and be prepared to feel like you got a food baby in ya . their watermelon lemonade is to die for !
american	you don 't go to mama 's kitchen you are making wrong decisions in life . just go . and , make sure you get dessert . go head mama . i see you ....
american	best wings around that i 've had so far ! tuesdays and thursdays are their specials ... great place for wings and sports
american	the waffle was sweet but not too sweet and the chicken breast was moist and wonderfully flavorful ! but the combination is fantastic ! ! my husband says roscoe 's doesn 't even compare to lo-lo 's ... oh and to top it off i had the mac n cheese and a tub of kool-aid ! ! this place is the only reason i would ever come back to phoenix ! ! i am pleasantly stuffed ! ! thanks lo-lo 's ! !
american	every single freakin time i go to vegas , i always stop here . the line is atrociously long , but service is incredibly fast . earl of sandwich should be on everyone 's bucket list !
american	my favorite sandwich evaaaaaaa ! ! got to have it every time i come to vegas ! !
american	heavenly is the one word i would use to describe them . i rarely write reviews and just wanted share .
american	i did take out and wanted to eat it in my room . it was the best piece of chocolate cake i 've ever had . yummy ! it made me wish i had dinner there instead of it 's neighbor the blt which was disguisting . george carlin loved this place , trust him .
american	= ) concept is easy : you pick your size & pay for the toppings you want . i had mushrooms , basil , pepperoni , and fresh tomatoes on mine . i can 't wait to go back & try some of the other toppings . maybe tomorrow !
american	very chocolatey , very rich .... i would get it again and would suggest you get it too !
american	i ended up feeding my whole family of five with the large order . so five stars for fresh fries and overflowing bag ...
american	we couldn 't finish the whole sandwich so i took it home and had it for breakfast , it was still good the next day . i want to go back to try something else .
american	i enjoyed all 3569 calories it had to offer . i never tried the food , so i cannot speak for it . get the shake . your stomach will thank you ! it 's addictive .
american	omg sooo good . order the lollipop passion and root beer . both of these mix drinks are a must . your welcome . if you already have a drink with you , you can 't bring it with you . i had to down my other drink before i could sit in the bar . there is a restaurant but didn 't eat there but did order fries . the fries weren 't good but the drinks were . the drinks are kinda pricey but i didn 't care . they are also open really late . this is at paris right in front of bellagio . there 's also a little store inside planet hollywood .
american	with that said , let me tell you how much i love both these items .... together ... one on top of the other ! it is a marriage made in heaven and before a big test i must have this for comfort ! will return after the stress of nursing school has left my life to try a gyro that i have seen in many reviews : )
american	i could sit there and look at the art for hours . now that i know about them , thank you ashley l. , i might try breakfast or lunch there some time .
american	we love coming here and the food has always been perfect and service is always great ! we always recommend this place to visitors .
american	all i have to do is tell you what we ate : ( hubby ) red velvet pancakes with white chocolate sauce , candied orange zest , and fruit jam on the side ( me ) signature waffles topped with blueberries , raspberries , strawberries , and blackberries and drizzled with your choice of white , milk , or dark chocolate sauce ( we ) spinach , cheese , and pepper omelet we couldn 't resist finishing with their fresh , hot donuts served plain , simply dusted with powder sugar with your choice of milk chocolate and white chocolate dipping sauce , and / or sprinkles go to sugar factory and have a party in your mouth !
american	it 's so good ! order it without cheese and aioli and it 's amazing and vegan . what ? yes ! we were in such disbelief that the burger was vegan that we had the server ask the chef to verify that it was in fact vegan . this place is a little pricey but it 's cute and new . i liked the decor which was open , airy , clean , and inviting . if i worked closer to here i would make this the place to go with coworkers for happy hour . also like that this place is open late so i can get the veggie burger when i get a craving later in the night .
american	wow ! ! ! definitely a must have . my omelet was amazing , seasoned potatoes were cooked to perfection . very happy with egg works .
american	loved it , and that 's coming from a girl who was raised in the south . the brisket was so tender it was hard to eat it with a fork . and the baby back ribs were outstanding . perfect hole-in-the-wall find .
american	if you haven 't tasted yardbirds version , you do not love yourself . it 's served over a chicken breast . everything is most and tasty . forgot that diet , just do it .
american	this is truly a hidden gem if you enjoy mediterranean food ! the cup of soup was the size of a bowl at any other restaurant . my brother ordered the moroccan chicken and it was enough to feed 4 ! just absolutely delish ! ! i ordered the falafel salad and again too big so i had to pack it to go ! ! they put 10 falafel balls on the salad and serve it with tahiti dressing . yum ! !
american	although you 're paying a premium , it is definitely worth the price . in terms of the other buffets , i only enjoyed about 10 % of the options ; here on the other hand , i enjoyed at least 85 % of it . i 'll return next time for sure ! ! also a plus that there was no wait when i came at 6 : 30pm on a monday .
american	" we went for brunch and it was probably the best i 've had in cleveland . do let the odd menu items throw you off l , just order . i guarantee you will enjoy your choices . make sure you start off with the charcuterie .
american	i got the poulet slice ( chicken ) pizza and it was pretty good and fresh . the bread it was made on was crisp and the chicken was cut as thin as to resemble ham and not overpower the cheese . i liked it so much , i ordered 2 lol .
american	yum ! ! ! i love lyfe ! although i feel their breakfast is better than the rest of the menu .
american	i live in the east coast and i still crave for the sandwich . i wish i had the chance to try other things on the menu . the drive-thru concept is pretty neat , but there was a bit of a wait . guess you can 't rush perfection .
american	bye bye biotch ! ! ! this place is finally good. hubby & i came here like 4-5 times in the last couple years under the old management and it sucked big balls. so today we are here at the nosh for happy hour and we 're happy ! the food , service and everything was great. thank u zack for being a super bartender and overall helpful sort : )
american	not only were we able to get prime seating during busy season , but everything was served in a timely manner . our waitress never forgot about us in her hustle and bustle around the restaurant . she even remembered to put in our dessert order before our meal was over . i really appreciated that . the burgers were appropriately priced and amazing . i suggest adding on the ooey gooey fries with the meal !
american	these babies are bomb.com. there have been days where my fiance and i have gone there for the fries alone because they are that delicious ! i 'm also a huge fan of the phattie pattie veggie burger and you can 't go wrong with their custom shakes , but please , no one ever tell me how many calories are in them . nothing that delicious can be good for you !
american	and excellent beer selection . i 'm a fan of the rogue hazelnut ( goes just right with the grilled cheese and soup ) . dimmed , relaxing lighting and awesome service !
american	they are so yummy . i had one with pierogies in it which was amazing . it 's large so you will definitely take some to go and all grilled cheeses come with chips and a tomato soup to dip . also , big highlight they take reservations !
american	oreo shake overloaded with goodness ? ! ! ok ! we visited during a bachelorette party on a sunday morning so we were all incredibly hungry . burgers , fries , tots .... everything was great ! service was even just as amazing . our server was attentive and friendly . it was a great way to start our sunday fun day !
american	all i have to say is if you live or visit ohio you must go to a melt-it 's phenomenal ! ! !
american	i almost always order the shrimp & arugula salad . it is soooo delicious ! it comes with about 6 jumbo grilled shrimp and the polenta croutons are amazing ! i have tried the recipe out of their cookbook for this , and even though the dressing tastes just like it , the croutons cannot be replicated . also , i love the chimichurri sauce that comes with the steak , so i always order a side of it and eat it with the salad instead of the dressing . i have been taking my daughter there since before she was one and she loves their tomato soup and grilled cheese . such a perfect little spot .
american	i 've always had great experiences here . i 've come here a couple of times since they opened , and they have changed a few things but i still love it here . the environment is cool and fun and there are so many mouth water food choices . even if you are just coming here for drinks , get their donut dessert ! ! they make it fresh and it comes with 3 dipping sauces . amazing !
american	it is so freaking good . i of course got the dog that would come with the most bacon. the hot dog was good but the bacon was the best part . i think i might have clogged up my arteries just a little bit after eating that hot dog . the location is cool because it 's right in front of the strip and you can sit and just look at the strip , but it 's not fun to be sitting out there when it 's super windy and hot . service was good and quick . the chili fries were pretty awesome too !
american	late night specials , can 't beat it . staff is friendly . would recommend for the late nighters .
american	everything else is pretty much what you can expect from a high end joint . the whole rotating thing is pretty awesome too .
american	oh and the bloody marys with the yummy little pickled green beans in them . definitely winning !
american	all i have to say is omg this is a great place to come eat cajun fries are the best and all food comes by the pound when i saw it on man vs food i knew it looked good but it tastes better than what it looks super fast to bring out the food and the service is the best ..... if ur in vegas it 's a must ! ! !
american	we happened to go to this place while in scottsdale while driving around and it is soooo amazing ! it 's like panera bread but way better ! great healthy options with fresh ingredients and i can 't wait to go back ! ! ! ! this is a must if you are looking for healthy but delicious options ! yummy ..
american	and don 't come here if you are worried about calories . leave the seats for people who want to eat . there are lines and i recommend making reservations .
american	they are seriously out of this world . i usually get the half and half with a skillet and the smaller version of the pancakes . seriously , they can 't be beat . if you take sugar in your coffee and are into the healthier trends , they have stevia by request too ! lots of menu choices , and consistent quality . it 's on my list of regular spots !
american	you can eat here for under $ 8 and be stuffed . the only bad thing about this place is they dont serve ranch , but they do serve bbq-ranch which is petty good . the mac n cheese is amazing also its crunchy on the top its great . i like that you can get your own soda and water its set up like a caferteria , which to me is really cool concept . the cookies are also amazing for $ 1.25 i would tell anyone to try this place its really good .
american	for all my vegans trying to curve you hot wing cravings this is the place ! i was in pittsburgh for work and my awesome driver found this place for me . i wasn 't sure what to expect since i hadn 't been to many bars that had vegan options . i ' m from texas where beer and bbq go hand and hand not meatless wings . i was thrilled to be able to sit at the bar have a beer and enjoy a vegan meal ! the staff was helpful and friendly . this was my first time to pittsburgh and double wide definitely left a lasting impression . great food and great service. looking forward to my next visit to pittsburgh !
american	seriously ... the best bartenders in vegas ! if you come here , do yourself a favor and introduce yourself to these awesome guys , they will become your best friends and confidants ! andre the chef makes the best cure burger of them all , make sure you add bacon to that beast ! and kyle ( the master server ) will always get you whatever you want with a smile on his face ! there is honestly no better local bar than remedy 's ! i love this place ! ! ! ! !
american	the hell 's kitchen burger was one of the best burgers ive ever had ! the meat was so tender and juicy , overall the burger just melted in your mouth . i couldn 't stop eating it , and i normally don 't finish a big meal .. but this burger ... i made it a mission to eat it .. i made it a goal ! and boy , i was sad once i was officially done with it because i knew it will be forever until i get this burger again . : ( it felt like i woke up from a great dream . if you are unsure on what to get from the menu .. get the hells kitchen burger !
american	this is a must go if you are visiting montreal . words cannot describe the how you feel when you are here . that is all .
american	it melts in your mouth , so tender and moist like nothing i 've ever had before . i crave it all the time . the two hour wait was well worth it !
american	all i have to say is there sandwiches are the best in town.i live like a block from the green valley ranch casino so its great i can just pop in and get a sandwich on my way home. also they have fries at the gvr location .i heard that all locals don 't offer fries. i suggest if you go and you haven 't been before that you get " the bobbie " its like thanksgiving on a roll. turkey stuffing cranberry sauce. amazing. i also dig the " slaw b jo " i find that there sandwiches are filling , creative , and down right unmissable .
american	michael went out of his way to make sure our daughter received the correct cake and even had his team go out of their way to deliver it . highly recommended place to order cakes for birthday parties .
american	i am not a beef eater ... i do not eat cows . however , i have been known to forego this principle of mine for a night- or two , for lawry 's prime rib . it is melt-in your mouth good ! and the creamed spinach is delicious ! love this place .
american	when my husband told me about it i was skeptical since we do live in the desert and on the west coast . what do they know about fried catfish , right ? well , i was wrong . you 've got to try it .
american	said pizza had been sitting out in a hotel room unrefrigerated for 14 hours . this did not deter the scorned sister one bit from desiring to devour it . also , they have a very impressive , serve-yourself beer fridge . well , the fridge itself isn 't that impressive , but the quality and variety of beers within it are .
american	" beyond amazing burgers and fries . we tired all 3 types of fries and each of us had a different burger . yum . had to wait 30 minutes to get in but totally worth it .
american	our server was sydney . she was super attentive , told us about the new menu items , an made some great recommendations ! it was so nice to have a server who actually cared about her guests experience ! we ordered the cinnamon roll pancakes , and theminced ham an egg . every thing was delicious ! ! ! me and my girlfriend are definetly making this out new breakfast spot ! ! ! !
american	outstanding ! the ribs were fantastic , plenty of meat and flavored to perfection . and the sides , the cabbage and mac n cheese were out of this world . my wife had the pulled pork over a homemade jalepeno and bacon cornbread waffle .. and last but not least was the incredible banana bread pudding in a small mason jar ! can 't wait to come back and try the fried chicken !
american	" the food is amazing ! the service there is also just as amazing . this is probably some of the best italian food i 've had in the valley .
american	the staff are extremely friendly and the food quality is 6 stars to me . the brisket just melts you don 't even need a knife . their sauces are amazing with the pulled pork and sausages . i 've been to texas and had their bbq , this place puts some of their spots in place . i would highly recommend you coming to this place with an appetite .
american	this place is amazingly good , prices are reasonable and the environment is just so positive . sam was our waitress and she was amazing , she made sure to have our food out fast and keep our drinks filled , she is truly a gem in this place . if your looking for a nice place to take your family for breakfast this would be the place .
american	this place is amazing ! our server was sweet and was very helpful when it came to the wine section of the menu and also helping us find a juicy steak , i wish i could afford to come here more often !
american	reminds me of grandmas carrot cake . but seriously , everything i have ever ordered in this place is delicious . even down to the mac & cheese . yes , i said , mac & cheese . don 't worry , as one of my co-workers put it ....... its adult mac & cheese . but man was it delicious . the club is amazing & apparently so is the french dip . can they go wrong w / any dish ? i think not . definitely one of the all time favorites in my life ! ! i should go right now .
american	we got a full slab of ribs and 2 sides mac & cheese . it was so much food we actually have leftovers and that is rare in our house . these were real ribs not the skinny ribs you find in other chain bbq joints . i can easily eat a slab of skinny ribs from a skinny pig . not these pigs - they were large and fat . i would absolutely go there again . too bad it took me 2 years of driving by to finally stop . now i know .....
american	it is the best hamburger you will ever try in your entire life ! ! ! ! a fried egg pastrami corn beef , a latke , caramelized onions and such amazing flavor ! will definitely do again .
american	i ordered the western omelet and so glad i did . not only did i have plenty for breakfast but there was tons to take home . huge fan and can 't wait to go back !
american	the burnt ends are amazing ! ! it is so tough to find burnt ends that are done right and these guys know how to do it ! ! thank you for awesome food and great customer service .
american	our friends raved about this place and he was meeting is there tonight ... no turning back now .. you know what . it 's worth every minute of wait time . we were seated and brought drinks .. the place was packed . an order of cheese curds and fresh .. damn fresh .. oysters landed on our table . along with pasta and fish fry .. everything was amazing . amy our server was sweet and attentive . well for sure be back . prices are perfect for quality of food and atmosphere is talkative , loud , and fun .
american	" i came here today with my dad & ordered the brioche bun , medium cooked patty , pepper jack cheese , onion , lettuce & bbq sauce with garlic fries on the side and it was absolutely fantastic . our waitresses were very genuine and friendly , i love the patriotic feel to this place .. overall great vibes and cannot wait to come back ! very good , highly recommend the burgers ! !
american	the hubs and i were hungry so i yelped a burger joint in phx . i was all bae this place has 254 reviews .. let 's go there ! we were in phx from prescott for the day . got the teriyaki burger rocket size and fries ! delishioursh ! hit the spot ! the owner even chased us to the parking lot to make sure we enjoyed our food yay ! ! ! ! !
american	avo bacon cheeseburger for less than $ 7 . heck yah ! 1 / 2 an avocado . oh i hope they never cheap out on that . 4 pieces of actual - real - meaty bacon . 1 / 3 pound of real beef that 's cooked on a real grill . fries tasted like real potatoes . a bit heavy with oil and enough salt to last a day or two . but , yum ! busy place . order online and show up near the end of the time window and you 'll be fine .
american	i get them at every chance i get . the buffalo ranch wings at joey d 's definitely make my top 5 list . they were fried perfectly - crispy skin - and even though they weren 't as saucy , the flavor of the sauce was just perfect . they were even good the next day , albeit a bit less crispy . i happened to be with a few other fellow ' yelpers ' at dinner , so i 'll let them review their own food / experience .
american	a must go place when in montreal for anyone . expect to wait awhile to be seated but as you 'll find out it 's well worth the wait . cheese mash potatoes omg . atmosphere ? it 's ok . i didn 't go there for that . the food is sublime . i go every time i 'm in montreal .
american	but not as good as an east coast a dog . still the staff was very friendly . service was very quick . plenty of selections . only drawback is this only seating available is outside but at least they have umbrellas . there 's a decent special that since we checked in with yelp ! we bought two dogs got one free . we even received a free shot of lemonade . mr. and mrs. steven e. are giving this a thumbs up
american	burger was good , chips and quac was good , the garlic fries were good . good looking bar . go check it out ! went with my sister and she asks for everything in a very particular way , and they had no issues catering to her specificity .
american	their omelets are huge , so you can , for a small ' sharing ' charge , split one with somebody and be quite well fed . their service is quick and friendly . the decor is ... just ignore it . the prices are reasonable and the food tastes pretty good . you should be satisified . don 't tax their culinary skills though . i 'd recommend sticking to the simpler breakfast type items .
american	wish there were more shops . some dining a little pricey but the food was very good . more live entertainment would be nice , especially during the day . well-managed and clean .
american	this is one of those place you should come to if you want to be wowed by how a dinner should be served . stood out as one of our best experiences in vegas ! the mushrooms were the best i 've ever had - still firm , amazing sauce . the mac n cheese was amusing for a mom who stocks up on the kraft variety ! the margarita pizza was disappointing . asparagus and kobe bugers were both worth it . the fries were magnificent - a can 't miss ! the lobster potatoes were also good but salty .
american	the menu was divers , the food quite good , and the entertainment abundant . the pricing was great with food and game card combinations . really an enjoyable experience .
american	it was really good but it could use a little more flavor .. my date got the grilled cheese with sun dried tomatoes and that was very good as well but it could of been more melted but hands down best thing was the frys
american	all in all not too bad ... the hummas is very good and the tabolie is ok ... i have never actually sat there for dinner since i get takeout ... the one thing i dont like is that they dont have fried kidby ... if anyone knows where i can find it please let me know ! ! !
american	bread was a little thin but it was late in the day sunday so that just might have been my bad luck . will def be back to try the fresh baklava i saw coming out of the kitchen .
american	they only offer dry brisket so if you are a moist brisket fan , find something else to order . plenty to choose from or dunk the brisket in the sauce to moisten it up .
american	great , relaxing , enjoyable experience . decently priced and a very unique set up within cityscape , the corner offered a variety of seating options from bar to open table space that is shared with other vendors . i also liked the option of being able to choose sides , drinks , and deserts from a grocery type set-up prior to ordering my entree .
american	the wings are huge and very tasty . the stuffed beer burger is also excellent . honestly that burger is by far one of the best burgers i have ever had in my life . my only negative is that they are not to good on cooking the burgers . the two times i carried my burger out it was still very pink in the center when i asked for well done . however , i pop it in the microwave and its still great ! definitely try the beer burger. especially if you like stout beer !
american	remarkable celebrity steakhouse in a field of mediocrity . excellent bread service , had the smoke tartare app- very tasty and unique presentation- bone-in rib eye was excellent . service was spot on . atmosphere was casual / trendy which for some might be off-putting for a steakhouse . but it worked - absolutely worth eating at while in vegas .
american	line moved quickly and efficiently . the friday lunch special i ordered was brisket with extra bark , collard greens , and mac-n-cheese . all for under $ 10 . delicious . i think ( other than my own ) their collards are the best around . what a pleasant sight and smell on monroe road . welcome !
american	smoked chicken was my favorite . brisket was delicious . pulled pork was juicy . hot bbq sauce was a great condiment . potato salad was some of the best i have had . beans were tasty . awesome bbq joint ! !
american	6oz sirloin , eggs and hash browns for $ 5.99 is one of the best deals around and you do to have to sign up for a players card . the steak has a nice char on it . i 'll be back for more .
american	all i need to say is all you can drink free beer on fridays .
american	wow ! both are signature gordon ramsey dishes and now i know why . the beef wellington is extremely tender ! unfortunately , it was my husband 's dish so i only got a couple of bites . i got the 24 oz. ribeye and while it was good , the beef wellington was a lot better . we , as a group of 6 , was so full , we shared just one toffee pudding . next time , i 'm getting my own no matter how full i mean . deliciousness .
american	the food is great and large portions . i have never had anything that i didn 't enjoy . they order their cheesecake from carnigie deli in nyc , if you have never had their cheesecake do yourself a favor and do it ! to add prices are very low . a must go to spot !
american	this is the go to family breakfast / brunch spot ! those diablo seasoned potatoes .... all that !
american	this one tops them all . the best in vegas and best one i have ever been to . everything is always fresh . the works are friendly and cool . the food is always good . this is the one in-n-out burger you should come experience to see what success is all about . plus any burger joint that offers vegetarian options gets points in my book . the way a burger joint should be .
american	all their food is prepared in-house and it shows . my lunch special was a chicken kabob grilled perfectly , rice , grilled veggies , freshly chopped salad and lightly dressed , and a cup of vegan lentil soup . my belly is happy and so is my wallet , $ 6.99 + drink ( which was comped with my yelp check-in , and refilled ) ! i 'll be back for sure . ps : my server did an excellent job explaining their food choices , philosophy , and attending to my dining needs .
american	indescribably delicious . every dish . we had the scallops , dirty pasta and chicken . also the cheeseboard , brussels and almond cake for dessert . i want to eat it all over again . everything honestly tasted amazing i don 't think you can have a bad dish here . just go here .
american	they have the best wings in town ! they fry the wings , but also grill them . all the staff is very nice and friendly . if you go more then a few times , they will know you and know what you will be ordering ! every time i have gone to jt " s it has been busy , so that say 's something about the place . so if your mouth is watering and craving wings , jt 's is your spot !
american	i 'd go back to eat the desserts alone ! yum !
american	people , check your order to make sure you received everything you ordered , before you drive back home. duh ! ! ! ! ! and if your wallet is hungry for cash then please , this is a new decade , go online and check the prices too see if you can afford it , complaining about prices and missed food is something that can be avoided ! ! ! ! use your head ! ! ! ! kudos too this chick fil a team. keep on keeping on ! ! ! you and your management team are doing a fantastic job !
american	the interior is so cool , the food is tasty , the staff is very nice . the burger is simply amazing and fish and chips too . it 's a very nice option for a meal during the weekdays
american	mindy our sever was a pleasure . she was at the table regularly to fill glasses and check on our progress . the food was as expected , great . check the picture posted of my breakfast meal . a lot of food for the money . watching the staff when not busy cleaning behind the counter was assuring of the cleanliness of the area . definitely the place to go for home style food .
american	best 10,000-calory benedictine breakfast ever ! i am very much into making benedictine eggs at home , but i simply can not reproduce this one . the djs are very cool as well . positive vibe coming from every corner . waited outside in -28 ( -32 real feel ) temperature for half an hour to get in , but it was totally worth it . don 't miss this one if you are in montreal .
american	this is my favorite location out of all the kona grills . amazing happy hour from 3-6pm ! haven 't tried anything i don 't like !
american	i walked in saw a group of firefighters there , so that was a good sign to see the locals still eat here . my burger was actually two patties , which was fine . they were cooked excellently . i splurged the the $ 2 for bacon and cheese on my burger . it was pretty messy , but what good burger with lots of fixings isnt ? i was a little disappointed in the onion rings . they were home made there , but fell apart easily and not all that flavorful . if you go , order a burger , stay away from the onion rings .
american	i also ordered the homemade potato chips and did not want to share it with anybody . they tasted so good . the service was awesome . love the free peanuts and bread while you wait for your meal . what a clever idea .
american	seems like a lot of resaurants out there have to have some kind of unique twist on breakfast and usually it tastes funky. this place is excellent simple idea perfect eggs everytime !
american	i was pleasantly surprised . we had the thai pork tacos , parmesan meatballs , bacon mac and cheese bites , and the loaded potato skins . it was awesome ! our waiter was very attentive and offered to re-fill my soda several times . he was right there when my husband finished his beer and quickly offered to get him another . i soooo miss tgi friday 's in hawaii ! ! !
american	i traveled to 2 ( or was it 3 ? ) popeyes locations on the same day , finding out that each one was closed and growing weeds before i came to this one . good : if you 're really craving an alternative to kfc or just want better chicken and biscuits , this is the place to go because this one is in operation ! bad : kinda sketchy and not very clean .
american	the gravy is not too salty , you get plenty of cheese curds and the fries are the perfect size for soaking up all that gravy goodness . there was also plenty of ketchup available on the counter for those that want to augment their poutine experience . getting coke in a glass bottle was a nice option as well . there are only a few stools to sit at inside plus a couple picnic tables outside if the weather is nice .
american	i suggest you try the macaroni and cheese for a side or the new orleans spicy shrimp . the wait staff is attentive and even brought warm wet napkins with lemon to clean up your hands .
american	we will come back many times for breakfast , lunch and dinner . i had rosemary , garlic chicken and my husband had the shrimp dinner . both dinners excellent . price very reasonable . service outstanding .
american	youu get a lot of lobster ! cajun style was delicious . its in a mall so the atmosphere is really casual . fries are ok . drinks are small but otherwise service was great and food was delicious ! ! ! too pricey in my opinion though
american	we spend every birthday there and special occasions too our favorite ! ! ! !
american	all items are under 500 calories and taste delicious . the portions are perfect and the price is just right . the ambience is very posh and casual all in the same place .
american	walking in the lobby on my first visit ran into a person cleaning the windows and making it smell quite yummy , believe or not the bathrooms were even clean . so many amazing items on the menu . i 've been there several times so far everything is very fresh and tasty . there wasn 't any rude drunken people neither . the bartenders are super friendly , and super amazing on conversation . marybeth and jerrica made my last visit totally fun and enjoyable . it was and all around wonderful place to go unwind have a bite to eat , with rememberable converstion . one of my top choices .
american	usually we eat at home . but when i 'm not in mood to cook , first place that coming to our mind is zookz . great people , great atmosphere , unique delicious sandwiches . i highly recommend this place . my favorites- for breakfast # 66 and for lunch # 60 ( but others good too ) .
american	i rarely give 5 stars but alex with the glasses made my experience all the more special . he knew our table 's taste buds down to a t ! my mom is a picky eater and likes simple foods but he picked out a great burger and beer and she had no complaints . she was even surprised that she liked duck bacon . he suggested i get a half guinness and half sam adams cherry wheat beer which was also great ! the sticky toffee pudding in the push pop form is a must ! i had the the chanterelle mushroom burger which was excellent . the food alone is worth 4 stars but alex with the glasses made me give 5 stars !
american	i never really understood what they meant . i mean , they are just sandwiches ... but when i finally went here for lunch to try it , oh man soooo delicious ! ! the bread is very tasty - crunchy on the outside , moist on the inside . i had the earl club which had turkey , bacon , and avocado . usually i dont like turkey , but it was moist and not dry which was good . i highly recommend it . you can 't go wrong with any of their sandwiches . they all look really good from the menu . my friends got the blt and the italian and they really liked it .
american	its a really cute place , although the wait is kinda long , but i expected it so it didn 't bug me much . our waiter was extremely friendly -- he even offered to sing happy birthday . two things that are a must get , the mac and cheese ( omg so good ) and frozen hot chocolate !
american	service , food was great . we came for lunch and will be back for dinner ! do not listen to the negative reviews . i had the veal with artichokes in a cream sauce with penne ... delish ! hubs had steak sandwich . he said " hands down , best steak sandwich i ever had " oh , and btw , our server was grace , and she was wonderful ! thanks grace for a great experience !
american	rave reviews from customer brought me here . the customize your own burger choices were phenom ! farm salad was fresh with tart balsamic roasted tomatoes was deeelish . high recommendation and look forward to another visit .
american	we sat in the restaurant area . date and goat cheese salad and some sonoma cutrer ? yes please . service was a little slow but he was very nice . saw the " big-a * * burgers going by were crazy big . food was great . didn 't eat the bread but it was a nice touch . i would return .
american	their food is authentic and made fresh daily ! my favorite is the steak picado pita which includes steak , grilled onion , green peppers and jalapeño . add their homemade tzatziki ( with no sugar or preservatives ) and you will absolutely love it ! the pizza dough is also made daily and the wonderful flavor of the pizza sauce is great ! they have a great variety of toppings to choose from and the portions are great for the price . i highly recommend you to go and try everything on the menu ! enjoy .
american	delish ish ! love the breakfast burger w / a fried egg on it . i get it lettuce wrapped , no mayo to keep it fairly paleo . sweet potato fries are bomb and don 't need the aoli they come with if you wanna keep the calories down .
american	this is a great fast food barbecue restaruant in gilbert . it 's not my first choice , but it is surely good ! this is hands down better then rudy 's bbq . the brisket is nice and i love the spicy sauce . pro tip .... come on your birthday and receive $ 10 off your meal . so worth it !
american	pancakes , sandwiches , scrambles ... and you can 't beat the view .
american	the ahi they serve is super fresh ! i will say the ahi dinner portion seemed small for the price . i would highly recommend the poke appetizer and the redfish ( you can 't ever get redfish in az ! ) we 'll definitely be back .
american	from the appetizers to the desserts , it was all amazing . this place runs like a well oiled machine ... they never missed a beat !
american	went on a monday seated right away , weekends , we heard , is an average 2hr wait ! ! downtown freemont , love the location . always prefer giving to local spots ! !
american	and when i say scratch , they are making it with fresh squeezed fruit ! they are delicious though . i went there once and got the risotto , it was really good . also , another tip is to be prepared that this " cellar " is basically a basement lol . so it is very warm and dark . may be an issue if you are claustrophobic .
american	they make sure to ask you if this your first time here . the french onion soup is to die for . ask for bread basket .
american	tanner was way cool and even bought my daughter a birthday dessert . the food and tanner deserve a 5 , but the atmosphere was ok . we would have liked a little more intimate seating . also for a meal of this caliber we would hope for fresh bread .
american	the biscuits and gravy is flavorful . the staff is always friendly and knowledgeable of the menu . definitely will continue to come and eat here !
american	yum ! yum ! yum ! my faves have been a special philly cheese steak wrap and the gyro . the fries are not amazing but are good enough . the soups are wonderful .
american	however , what keeps me coming back is their desserts and their employee johnnie . the desserts never ever disappoint . johnnie is on it ! we never wait , she multi tasks and is so nice and friendly .
american	you walk into a brewery and expect basic food and great beer , but they excel in both ! the beer breads are to die for ! the french fries are out of this world !
american	i really enjoy being able to consistently try new , seasonal dishes and have them blow me away each time . their cheap date nights ( $ 50 per couple ) is a great way to attract people who would not pay their usual prices . as a college student , this option is a really great way to have a nice meal out without spending too much money . that said , their normally priced menu is a bit over the top in price .
american	seating is split between the bar and the sit-down dining room . there is video poker , shuffleboard , big screen tv 's displaying all the current sports games , and you can watch kids playing live ice hockey on the attached rink . so fun : )
american	you definitely need to come here if you 're ever in champaign . i usually get the pulled pork sandwich with georgia peach sauce but i 've also had rib tips and those are flame too . only thing that is annoying is the wait and the fact that you can 't make a reservation but i guess there 's not a lot you can do about that considering it 's a super popular place .
american	i got a mexican inspired dish and my husband got regular bacon and eggs ( he 's low carb so limited choices for him ) . he said it was the best bacon he ever had . the coffee was french press , and i 'm not a coffee fan at all- makes me gag- this coffee was amazing . we will definitely be going back . i wish they were open for dinner too .
american	the owner is super friendly ! ! the baklava was freshly made and the samosa is incredible .... everything we have had has been wonderful !
american	ordered the chicken keemeh kabob with the kabuli style rice . the meant had a wonderful flavor which matched well with the sweetness of the rice ( with added carrots and raisins ) . the staff are super friendly and patient - i am a novice to afghan food , and our server explained the entire menu to me . he also went out of his way to turn off the fan to make sure we were comfortable . i will definitely be back . everything was delicious .
american	the only problem i had was with the salmon patties . they were not at all what i was expecting but still good .
american	place is in an old house downtown . super cute . highly recommend .
american	portions were very generous on drinks and food ! several items we wanted to order we unavailable so the manager gave us 2 free deserts . will definitely be back !
american	im a vegetarian , & didnt love the veggie burger ... but the fries were perfect & the shakes were delicious ! !
american	i had ep and jenn as my bartenteders , they were amazing and super helpful . i would recommend sugar creek to anybody !
american	i love the variety of food and i 'm a sucker for their spicy potato mash . i 've never been for happy hour but they seem to have great beers on tap from the posters all around .
american	love their garlic infused mac and cheese and their coleslaw , delishhhhh .
american	the chorizo tacos , corn dogs , soft pretzels and mac 'n'cheese are must haves . the service is usually very good but it gets so loud when it is busy , which it seems to always be very busy when i come in .
american	the service was great as well . the server was a brunette gentleman with a pony tail and had only been there 4 months , but was trained and polite as if he 'd been there for years . i would highly recommend this place to anyone . sunday happy hour was from 2-4 with $ 5 apps and discounted drinks .
american	we came here for father 's day because of their gluten free menu . their gluten free food was delicious , my boyfriend got the steak sandwich on the gluten free bread and it was awesome . server was great and we had an overall great experience .
american	bottomless drinkinging option with beer and wine is a plus . italian station pasta is really good . latin section beef is really good . there are few items od sushi which are good as well . salmon is baked and lottle friend which gives it smoky . food quality pricewise is really recommended .
american	they have the best steaks west of chicago , hands down . you pay alot but get your money 's worth . great side dishes & service . you must try profiteroles & or cherry cobbler . enjoy this a great restaurant .
american	love this place and so glad a healthy and delicious place came to ahwatukee !
american	these days , i stick with the salad bar because i love it . tons of options and always replenished on a regular basis . when i want a filling meal under $ 10 , this is a great go-to spot . if you get the salad bar , you don 't have to wait in line . you can use the touch screen when you walk in and go right to pick up your plate . fantastic !
american	great hole in the wall place to grab a beer and wings . great service and the food is always hot and fresh . the place is hidden but i am glad i found it . you will not be disappointed .
american	i really enjoy the omelette with the goat cheese and arugula . wonderful establishment for breakfast and brunch .
american	pbbq has the best corn bread in the city ! the barbecue sauce is so good that i stock up on it for the winter . i only have two complaints ; the banksville road location has no indoor seating and i 'm not a fan of any of their sides . if you enjoy the typical dry sides of a barbecue then you might like them , though .
american	lvv is a really unpretentious cozy place to have a bite to eat . it 's one of the only restaurants in montreal that i 've been to twice . my only complaint is that i think the food could be better . it 's solid but it also feels like if they tried only a little bit harder ( or used just slightly higher quality ingredients ) they could easily take it to the next level .
american	i had the veggie burger in a wheat wrap with sautéed mushrooms and onions , tomato and sriracha . yum ! the fries weren 't crisp and a little soggy but it the wrap and my boyfriends " serious " burger were good .
american	that is exactly what you can expect from any of the palm restaurant and is by all means a restaurant anyone should experience at least one time and to the level expected from this fine dining establishment .
american	the burger is great . my favorite salad is the kale and quinoa and if your going for breakfast try the commuter sandwich and a potato . one of my favorite places to eat . everything is so good .
american	if you haven 't been yet , go . like , right now . get in the car and go find your bliss in the form of hot dogs and onion rings . there 's even another location in ballantyne now , so if you 're not near east blvd , you still don 't have an excuse . if you keep missing this representation of heaven on earth , it 's your own fault . i 'm on your team , so i only want the best for you and this is the one of the best places to do a hot dog .
american	there filet mignon might be the best i have ever had . linsey always makes the perfect drinks .
american	their vegan clam chowder ( made with cashew cream ) was off the hook . however , i was disappointed by the vegan chickn and vegan crab cakes . the flavors just weren 't there for me . but , i give them 4 stars because they have a good amount of vegan options , good service , good vegan clam chowder , and vegan carrot cake for dessert ( even though i didn 't partake in such since i was in the mood for chocolate ) .
american	service has been excellent every time . all the food is excellent , however make sure you get the tortilla soup if available . the ribs , french dip , and hot fudge sundae are great too .
american	it really depends on how good of a golfer you are and what you 're trying to experience . this is quaint little course , it 's actually gotten better the last couple of years . the place is old but shows a ton of pride of ownership . the price is right , the management is great and without the ego that other courses offer . if you go in the morning , look for mel . 94 years old and out there five days a week , gentleman 's gentleman and he hits it straight down the fairway .
american	it is great ... one of the best meals that we have experienced in a long time . took advantage of their restaurant week special menu ( 3 courses with a wonderful variety ) . convenient location , easy parking , spectacular views of the tpc golf course and terrific food . a must visit ! !
american	in fact , i 've enjoyed most everything i 've had there . the bartender , josh , is attentive and hilarious . the owner , dave , wants nothing more but to make his customers happy .
american	very solid pancakes of course ... which they offer the full recipe on their website and i have made them for family and friends multiple times now . definitely worth trip ... but make sure to have a reservation !
american	i 've had brunch and dinner and they 're right . all of these reviews will tell you that the services is great . again , they 're right . what i want to highlight is how perfect this place is for an event . the upstairs is perfect for small parties around 25 people . it 's great for something like an engagement party . i 'm not getting married , though .
american	from the time we walked into the restaurant we were greeted and staff was helpful and patient while we selected our toppings . they even brought our pizzas to the table . the pizza was delicious ! ! wish i lived closer so i could come back ! keep up the great work guys !
american	the waiter was very knowledgable on the menu as well . the food was great ! i ordered a pasta dish and you could tell the pasta was freshly made .. no dry pasta here . also the octopus appetizer was delicious . would definitely go here again !
american	a group of 3 of us shared two appetizers- fried deviled eggs and cinnamon biscuits ( yum to both ! ) , and each of us had an entree- 2 had the egg truffle sandwich and one had the shrimp and grits ( all of which were very tasty ! ! ) . i would recommend this place , but there can be a wait since it is a small building .
american	i ordered some silly sounding thing like a chicken fiesta or some such and it was literally the best chicken something i have had in ages . it also had bell peppers and onions which were cooked to perfection . my husband got a gyro thing and that was good too . we got the kid a burger which she didn 't eat so i don 't know about their burgers . the fries were super good and had a french fry seasoning on them . they were directly across from the hotel we were staying in which was the main reason we went but if i was ever in the area of a showmars again i would eat there !
american	the food is absolutely amazing . the cake is worth it and delicious !
american	my boyfriend and i fell in love with poutine on a canada vacation so on a recent work trip to toronto i was so excited to stumble upon this place . this poutine is top notch ! i had the pulled pork .. delicious ! ! ! loooove that they have so many different options .. can 't wait to come back and try more !
american	in las vegas , it 's about the food but also the customer experience . the food is very good but , the service is inconsistent served with a side dish of arrogance ! there are many wonderful place to eat both on and off the strip . go somewhere that appreciates their clientele and leaves the attitude at home .
american	we came here for a birthday and what a let down . must be tailored to a tourist because no right minded local would pay $ 35 / person for that sub par continental breakfast . they charge you every time you refill your coffee ! for real ? they charge yiu for every coffee ! lol buffet does not include eggs , waffles , pancakes , ... if you wanted them they were made to order and would deliver one pancake at a time . they were missing variety , quality , and quantity . very disappointing for sure and i can say that i will go to the local spots that earned their reputation .
american	first thing is getting to the restaurant is not easy and having to walk through ballys you realize just how dirty the casino is . i got to the restaurant at 11 sat at the bar ordered a beer number one they came in a plastic cup like i 'm at a ballgame instead of a restaurant . i ordered the donnie burger and fries , the donnie virga came rare when i ordered it medium the fries were undercooked . i asked the bartender may please have some silverware and some napkins she brought me a plastic fork and plastic knife to go with my plastic cup of beer . although i am a big fan of the show this restaurant is horrible
american	it was okay . buffet is small and limited selection vs other grander buffets in the city . i didn 't feel it was worth the price . while wynn is exceptionally beautiful , i was surprised to see the limited selection and size at wynn . will need to expand to attract more people .
american	all service related ... so bad we just got up after our drinks and walked out . patrick , if you don 't like what your doing .... find something else .
american	why charge $ 0.75 for a coffee refill ? nobody else does , to my knowledge . 1st cup was gone by the time the food arrived . pay up , buddy . " i will have to add $ 0.75 to your bill now . " not acceptable .
american	blonde " manager ... " stay away from her . she looks like shes going to rip my head off as she hands me my coffee . why do i even bother ?
american	ordered the usual mushroom on ciabbatta , mom had her shrimp and dad had burning love burger . unfortunately both burgers and fries were cold however the server did a great job and promptly got the manager . dad ' s came back good however my meal ended up being french fries and iced tea . lucky leftovers at home . even though the meal was not what we planned the manager really tried and we could see he cared .
american	you can tell joe 's is taking for granted the good business it does because the waits are long , the service terrible and general comatose nature of the staff is not good . we waited 22 minutes to get seated , 10 minutes to order anything , and another 30 for our kids dinners to come out . we asked for ours to go because it was taking so long . not so much of a sorry from the waitress . we will never go back .
american	had the corned beef hash , my wife had the thick cut bacon breakfast . huge biscuits . but will not be coming back to this location . even though the food is amazing the customer service was so bad that it ruined my breakfast . rude waitress . didn 't catch her name , young blonde girl . then when we went to pay the guy , who i 'm assuming was the manager , didn 't look up at me once as i paid for my meal . what a shame . even the people behind us were complaining about the service . usually you get what you pay for but i over paid this time ...
american	guess i 'll have to wait a little longer . the buns and dogs were steamed well but that 's about all that was right . onions were cut way too large and wrong type of onion was used making the flavor too strong , the coleslaw was dry and not marinated at all . the other problem with little dog is their french fries , not at all the type of fries you 'd find at a steamie restaurant and more like mcdonald 's or burger king garbage fries . i really wanted this place to be great but guess i 'll just have to wait a little longer
american	so when i saw a place dedicated to the stuff , i had to try it . i was disappointed . as a place dedicated to poutine , i feel like they should have mastered it . the fries weren 't as good as i expected and the gravy lacked flavor and was watered down . a true canadian pointed me in the right direction for poutine ( kfc ) and i 'm glad i tried it . who knew !
american	being from san diego , where a lot of top gun was made , it was awesome to see the theme of this place . usually cheesesteak places have pretty simple menus , but not here . i dont think there is anything you can 't get on the sandwich . i went with a standard cheesesteak and sadly it just wasn 't that good . someone might want to take a trip down to philly and see how the steak sandwiches are supposed to taste .
american	yes , they had excellent food and a smoking hot server , but there were monuments to the destructive acts of the american military all over the place . may as well have called it the shrine of destruction instead of mcdonalds . safe to say i won 't be visiting this war memorial anytime soon
american	my boyfriend and i checked it out one afternoon for lunch . after we were seated , our waitress informed us they were pretty much out of every side besides their homemade potato chips . ooookay . so we ordered .... i ordered the shrimp poboy and my boyfriend had the crab cake / seafood sandwich . it was horrible ! the shrimp poboy only had about 6 shrimp on it and they were flavorless . the crab cake was soggy . definitely won 't be going here again .
american	the food was average and the wait staff was awful . the server looked annoyed she even had to breathe much less work there and not a fan of the ambiance / environment . nope . thanks . next .
american	the presentation of the sandwich was just that ... a sandwich . no lil sprig of parsley or lettuce or anything to make the plate look inviting at all . i was told to add a bit of sugar snap peas would cost extra . wth ? really ? ! ? no thanks ! el pollo loco is down the street and i think i 'll patron them before i do zupas .
american	i 'm not sure what 's so socal about this place that would separate itself from capriottis and subway . besides the sandwiches with avocado ( san diego staple , y 'all ! ) , " california " veggie sandwich , and chips from california . it 's like any other sandwich place . i wished they had more seafood inspired sandwiches ( except for tuna ) or a surf and turf sandwich would 've been cool . prices are on the high side , too . $ 8 for half sandwich , chips , and drink . i 'm a cheap college student , duh . i would comeback if they had more specials , otherwise i 'll be at stephano 's .
american	this time they got my order wrong after waiting 25 minutes . then one of the employees was rude to me like it was my fault . remade my food with the same fries so they were cold . great job guys ! if this is how you treat employees how the fuck do you treat your guests ?
american	the most over cooked eggs i have ever experienced . it was absolutely inedible . even though i ordered from the gluten free menu and stated that i was celiac , i still was exposed and have been suffering from a gluten exposure .
american	this week it was hash house a go go located at the linc . i 'm a food snob , i admit it ! the service was good , didn 't have to wait long for a table or food once i ordered . the problem was , it was obscene ! nobody should have that amount of food in one sitting . it definitely wasn 't great ( i had the meatloaf sandwich ) , it wasn 't even mediocre . i brought home 3 / 4 of it for later . it hit the garbage can today .
american	unfortunately i was hugely disappointed by the quality of the sandwiches . i got the turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce and mustard on cranberry walnut bread and the sandwich was dry ... the bread lacked flavor , the turkey tasted gamey instead of having a nice roasted flavor to it and the cranberry sauce was barely on it . i also got a cup of the tomato soup , which was good but nothing extraordinary . personally , i wouldn 't bother with this place - a sandwich shop that doesn 't make good sandwiches is not worth the money .
american	we were looking forward to a three star experience . we had a lovely server but i was disappointed in the food . the chef tries too hard to be different and looses subtlety of food taste . everything is with a heavy hand . i ordered the halibut but it was dry . the flavor of the fish was overpowered by the peppers and the artichoke was so overdone that all the taste was lost . we arrived at 7 : 30 and the restaurant was quiet enough for conversation but then it became full and i couldn 't even have a conversation and asked for the bill . too bad disappointed
american	as an fyi , you are not allowed to have the salad in a separate container when ordering one of the specials ... you 're veggies will be nice and soggy by the time you get home
american	we started with the fig-sambuca bruschetta which the presentation was great and it was very tasty but spreading out the cheese over the figs really improved the flavor since the way it is served you get a bite of cheese and then the second bite is fig no cheese . the combination of fig with cheese is much better . we then had the margarita pizza which was bland , bland crust just pretty much tasteless , nothing memorable . doubt we will be back .
american	presentation is a 4-5 desert a 5 . everything else is cooked with way too much salt and butter . lemon zest is almost in every plate . i was sadly disappointed . traditional italian dishes are buttered down with a strange lemony flavoring . my fiancé enjoyed the $ 60 steak i enjoyed the chocolate tart . i would never go back to this restaurant though . it 's over priced and sadly disappointing . service is a 4 .
american	i went here for brunch , the service was terrible . the waitresses were unfriendly and unattentive , you would have to call them three-four times before you can get their attention . i ordered the eggs bannodict and my boyfriend ordered the croissant french toast . both were sub-par . nothing out of the ordinary . if you are looking for overpriced and bland brunch . this is the spot . will not be coming back .
american	most places have a veg burger , hell , some places have a homemade from scratch veg burger . went to b spot on thursday for lunch with a couple co-workers . there is one veg burger option , why burger ( portobello mushroom ) . it was fine . the fries are cooked in lard . my co-workers enjoyed their burgers . one of them actually goes to b spot about one to two time a month . the service was wonderful . the server was very friendly , talkative and refilled my pop often . i enjoyed the pickle bar .
american	i ate at this squirrel hill location the first week i moved to pittsburgh and the food was mediocre at best . i tried another location in edgewood and it was mediocre bordering on tasteless . in a town with so many restaurant options , i can 't believe that people still eat here . yes , the smiley cookies are good , but a cookie does not a whole restaurant make . at the risk of sounding dramatic , this place is an affront to diners and greasy spoons everywhere .
american	never go into a new place with expectations . what a disappointment . i really thought it would be different than it was . food is so so at best . they have a decent chicago style hot dog . that was only thing i actually liked . fries were nathan 's fries essentially . they 're fine but crinkle cut isn 't that huge to me . burgers are fast food . staff is excellent . very polite . not the look i 'd expect from the name but my wife loves it . i pictured 50 's diner . very clean . trendy etc . short story long , doubt i 'll be headed back . too many better places out there .
american	not very much meat on them . i had a half slab of ribs and came away still hungry . the coleslaw was not out of the ordinary , the potato salad was pretty good though . honey bears bbq is much better than this . there has to be a good bbq somewhere in mesa .
american	i found it today . this burger was down right gross . mushy and tasted like dog food is the closest i can describe it but even that doesn 't cut it . i can 't get the nasty taste out of my mouth even hours later . i wish we went to mcdonalds or drove all the way to in and out instead . the fries and onion rings were good though . i can 't understand the raving reviews for this place .
american	i usually expect standard service , standard fare , and cute women . i 'm not looking for anything special . this truly has to be the worst hooters i 've ever visited . they moved a wait to be seated sign onto the patio , when 10 tables are available .
american	truth be told , the menu clearly states that hash browns are served with their eggs benedict as opposed to home fries , as i mistakenly stated . though i certainly appreciate what i believe is honest concern about my experience as a customer from the management , the fact remains that no cook worth their salt could possibly have been proud of serving frozen hash brown patties and bland eggs benedict . an a for service ; an f for food .
american	as an adult i thought it was a huge establishment that should have had more going for it . perhaps i will try it out again in a couple months because the food was okay but nothing special .
american	while the bagels were great , the asshole who yelled at me for taking photographs ( which were meant to write a positive post ) ruined it . not only was it unprofessional ( 13 + years in the hospitality industry , i 'd never be disrespectful to a paying customer ) , but had i not already paid for my order , i would have absolutely walked out . i don 't care how good your food is , i wouldn 't recommend this place to anyone excited to try and share a new experience and subject them to a verbal attack from the miserable f * ck ... pretty sure his name is joe , and i think he even owns the place .
american	went here ( given it was near close ) and the food wasn 't great ! tasty ... but it was basically corn fed beef dressed up nicely ( im feeling bloated now .. i wish i just went to holy chuck ) ... small menu , overpriced too ! decent service ... the sangria was good too .. walking distance from my house , but if this place wants to be a boutique burger it 's going to have to go with real grass fed .
american	well , i finally gave in and booked my pharma group of 16 there for a dinner last month . read this - big mistake ! i should have stayed with my gut feeling and prior reviews .... poor service , cold food , small portions for the price of the meal ( $ 75.00 per person for 3 courses ) and then to top it off i overheard staff complaining that this group was " too cheap " to purchase a decent wine .... although i did not complain , i will certainly not be back nor refer anyone else .....
american	there was barely any curds and the gravy was horrible . i thought i had a bad experience the first time , so i gave it a second chance and it still disappointed . the gravy has its own type of flavor i can 't put my finger on it , but make no mistake , this is definitely not what a poutine should be . as a quebecer , makes me sad that people think this is real poutine .
american	imagine my amazement when i discovered that there was an uno 's in madison ! wrong . while the original pizzaria uno ( at ohio and wabash ) is wonderful , something is lost in translation here . i can 't even explain it . it 's just bad . the hunt for good deep dish in madison continues ...
american	" originally , the entree price included a salad and pasta . a few years ago the salad was no longer included . tonight i learned that the pasta was no longer included . a fancy restaurant may be able to get away with ala carte meals , but not a " neighborhood joint . " shame ! the restaurant was crowded tonight and i can only describe the service as " benignly neglectful . "
american	consistency in food preparation does not exist between locations . the house salad was incredibly small for the price and compared to other locations . the chicken wings dry ( lacking glaze ) and over cooked . it would ne irresponsible of me to recommend this to anyone . this establishment is far to exspensive have an extremely poor quality of food product . i will not ever return .
american	the hostess quoted our table of two 40 minutes while we saw at least 5 empty and clean tables . being a server for the past 8 years did teach me that you should under promise and over deliver your guests but these wait times were ridiculous and are the type of actions that drive customers away . we almost left as we got our text to be seated less than 10 minutes after we put our name in . staff needs some training .
american	this was the worst excuse for a wingstop franchise i have ever visited . wings tasted old , the louisiana rub was watered down , yes it is supposed to be a dry rub , the mild sauce was also watered down . no flavor . tried to call but no answer . would love to here from the franchise owner . the location is on baseline by frys . threw away $ 20 at wingstop so i went to sonic . horrible wingstop location ! ! !
american	poor service rven when it is not busy , however the ladies whom may or not be blonde are typically asu attractive . food , on two occasions is bland . ceasar chicken wrap , the deep fried breading tasted like the oil was old , they just slap some small chunks of chicken on a tortilla , add some tasteless dressing and serve . the hot wings are anything but .
american	but because the voters decided to pass senate bill 206 to have workers make a decent wage , harold 's charges you a sb206 tax . i told the waitress why doesn 't he raise the prices of the food , she replied he did . so that means you and i are all paid twice . these poor people only make 10 bucks an hour which is not even enough . i will not go back
american	we were sitting relatively close to the front stand and were able to hear everything . also , it was 02 : 00 am . the host was clearly aware of his mistake and tried to play it off . there 's no excuse .
american	bruha manager said i had to pay for a meal that was cold and not correct ! i did eat because i was starving but left 1 / 3 of to show them ! never will i go to an ihop again ! no stars for this place rude untrained and very disrespectful ! no wonder this place has a 2 star rating ! ! ! !
american	come to find out there gourmet dinner buffet is now down graded from last year very disappointed after spending 40 @ each for buffet . rather go to rio way better . after we finished eating went to play after @ 30 to 40 min spent 100 dollars playing slots no sign of waitress call a lady said she couldn 't go inside to look for her call " manger " gave lame excuse and casino wasn 't even busy . finally waitress comes brings water with attitude . will never go there or any mgm properties they now charging for valet 13 dollars . they have attitude they seem they don 't care .
american	as a rule i like the golden corral , this one was pretty clean , but the food could 've been hotter , informed our server , they rectified the situation but was to late for us , food still had good flavor , pot roast is always some of the best , as well as the bourbon chicken , but it was cold normally if they 're clean they 're 4 stars but i was a little disappointed cause it wasn 't as hot as normal
american	upscale and up pricing today 's lunch was a disappointment . steak salad was drenched and soggy and the 4 pieces of thin slices steak , with 2 dollops of feta made it tough to swallow the $ 17 price associate had a beef dip the featured shaved beef that took me back to the 1970 boil n ' bags , the taste was same according to my dining friends they have downs alex the food quality big time , added more lettuce with weak ass dressing , and kept prices high next time will not be a next time
american	this one not so much ! bang-bang shrimp was breaded too much and there was no bang ! they were out of sweet tea , we had to wait for them to brew more . bread not placed in table until just before meals arrived . husband 's asparagus was bigger in diameter than my pointer finger . and , his shrimp and scallops were served cold . daughter 's shrimp tasted very " fishy . " three other kids ordered angler steak ( sirloin ) . they were given and charged for filet ! ! we will not be going back to this location ! !
american	the ticket times for both food and beverage were ridiculous . the server was in the weeds , due to the hostesses over-seating his section . the bussers wandered around aimlessly , while the m.o.d was careless and non-existent . my ticket , table for 2 , entrees were delivered 20 minutes apart . the operation of this establishment is sloppy and embarrassing .
american	when smokes first appeared on the toronto scene years ago , i liked it due to it being the only alternative to poutine from harvey 's . but as other poutine places emerged , the quality expectations grew while smokes was ... well left in the dust . the classic poutine is ok to hit the spot on a late drunken night , but i 'm often left disappointed . all the other abomination of poutines they have are horrible , i see them as poutine blasphemy .
american	however , it wasn 't the long wait or lack of refills on our beverages but the attitude the accompanied any plea for anything . longhorn clearly isn 't flemings but rudeness is just uncalled for .
american	last night i went there with my sister , parents , and nine-year-old son , and dinner for all of us was over $ 80 ! our chicken skillets were $ 16.99 each - much more expensive than it used to be , and the portions are smaller ! not only that , but my sons steak had a lot of fat on it . our waitress , dee , was wonderful , but the experience wasn 't worth it for the price .
american	i had the spicy chick 'n po-boy and the sandwich was only mediocre ; i wouldn 't order it again . the best part of my meal was the tahini coleslaw . my lunch data had the coconut curry and she thought it was ok . the noodles and veggies were cooked well , however the flavor definitely felt like a little amateur . i won 't go back . many of the patrons had deserts so maybe that is the way to go .
american	for a vegas restaurant in mandalay bay i had higher expectations .
american	the menu is very appealing , but the food is only so-so . huge portions , but almost everything seemed fried and then smothered in salt and vinegar . ( i love frying and salt and vinegar , but a little variety would have been great . ) the best things were the appetizers , especially baba ghanouj and caramelized cauliflower glazed with ( what else ? ) tons of salt and balsamic vinegar . nice staff , attractive restaurant , easy parking . if they thought a little more creatively about the food preparation , this place could be terrific . i 'd love to give it another chance the next time i 'm in town .
american	i showed them my va photo id and they told me i could not get a free sandwich . they said it was a 2 for 1 deal and i had to pay for one . i told them that is not what subways corporate office said . i have used this subway for several years but no more . i will definitely tell all my former brothers in arms about this place . i did get a sandwich at the subway on arizona ave just north of the target store without a big blast of grief this is where i will eat from now on .
american	i assumed in 2016 money was money , and clothing should not matter , but not here . you must be dressed or they will turn you away . the best part is i have to laugh because the business should not be turning anyone away at this point , they look like they could use all the customers they can get .
american	it 's to bad because their located in a very pleasant quaint downtown location , very good for people watching . i ordered the fried pickles and their famous smoked pork bbq sandwich . both were awful . the fried pickles were the worst i have had and i 've eaten many in various locations . they were soggy and very salty , absolutely horrible . their sandwich had no bbq , not even the carolina vinegar variety and if it is there you barley notice it . barley noticed any smoked flavor in the meat , it 's to bad it looks like a great place to hang out and drink . the servers were nice , but the food is just that bad .
american	blah . no one was mean and bottled beer is bottled beer but i might as well have stayed home . a good bar is more than just 4 walls and counter to belly up to . depressing .
american	hometown buffet is better than more . granted , more looks classier than a hometown buffet-type restaurant , but the selection is the same , if not lesser , and the food isn 't even as good . the nice thing about this buffet is that you can get an all-day pass for more and the buffet at the excalibur for only $ 35 . the reason that it is so inexpensive is because the selection and food is poor . of the two , however , this is the better buffet , but that is a reflection on the buffet at the excalibur , not of the grand quality at more .
american	should you wish to dine here on an evening or a friday , saturday or sunday night , finding a parking space in the parking lot will be impossible apparently the holiday inn express has commandeered the entire parking lot for their hotel and the parking lot is " empty . " as for the staff , other than letting me know that holiday inn will tow my car , there is no other help to dine at their franchise . it is hard to sample the food when you have no way to park your car safely or within 600 ' or their door .
american	a scientific first .. i am not a fan of these flavors ipa has a perfume flav and the midnight mayhem is too smokey for me .. unusual flavors here today but it 's busy
american	i visited the cafe during july , so my group of three wanted to sit outside . the inside was kind of tight , anyway . we waited for over 45 minutes to get a table and awkward around all of the people sitting outside but there wasn 't anywhere else to stand . when we were finally seated , it took our server forever to even bring us our drinks . later , when the food finally arrived , i was disappointed . if i 'm going to wait for an hour and a half in total to get my food , it better be amazing . this was pretty average .
american	) i ordered a small portion of average brisket and a side for around $ 20 i don 't think i 'll be returning .. too much competition in this neighborhood to deal with minimal options , a pricey menu married with a super casual , dark environment . giving two stars for the attentive customer service , but i can 't say i prefer the food , menu or restaurant atmosphere .
american	the place was empty . the beer selection is weak . bud and four peaks . nothing special . it could be great with the patio and the layout . i wish them better luck .
american	the idea of cooking your own meat is interesting , no one to blame if you overcook it . the salad bar that comes with the steak is from hunger . the sea food meat alternative is less than great . expect to pay about $ 80 to 100 for a dinner for two with wine. the atmosphere is drab , too dark to my taste with little or no character. this place begs the question why not stay home and cook the steak for a fraction of the cost ?
american	that said however , the food both times has been bland and very uninspired . some , including the mushy raspberries in the " fresh " fruit dessert , was just downright bad and the kitchen should be ashamed to let it hit the dining room floor . there were no hits and the other big misses were the too salty crab cakes and the steak ordered medium rare that came out medium well , dry and tough . service was passable but missed a number of empty glasses in front of various thirsty patrons . cmon , we 're in the desert and dehydrated ! the sports bar is a better , for the money , bet if you decide to dine on the resort property .
american	# 1 we went there for the first time expecting elegance with soft background music . not so . # 2 marinara sauce on the chicken parmesan was watery . # 3 companion 's filet mignon was undercooked , and " corrected " to inedible . # 4 our waiter was usually unavailable but waiters for other tables seemed available and attentive . unfairly or not , a return is unlikely . not a good experience , possibly not typical .
american	the original matts big breakfast is great but the airport one is nothing like it and the food is just overpriced and tasteless .
american	i had a steak that had more gristle then meat . horrible steak .
american	only come here if you are going to sit at the bar and has at least 1 and a half hours . it will take your server around 30 minutes to come greet you and another 30 minutes for your food to come . the food is not good , way different than the original outside of the airport . i am not sure why these restaurants still risk their business by allowing hms host to operate their reputable businesses . i will not come back here and encourage others to do the same .
american	unfortunately it proved to be a terrible and costly mistake . the $ 21.00 burger i ordered arrived in yesterday 's bun and was burnt beyond recognition . i sent it back only to receive another one that was equally " rendered " to carbon . i can only compare the taste of the burger to what i imagine the burnt meat scraped off of a bbq grill tastes like . to add insult to injury , my girlfriends meal arrived a full 10 minutes after my homage to the disaster at pompeii was served . for this reason lynn , you 've been chopped ...
american	the staff , on the other hand , leaves a lot to be desired . when the manager says to a party of 7 , " it 's time " -after telling us that in " 10 minutes you have to get out of here , " it 's no wonder the staff is unhappy . work on your management and manners , sharp edge . no thank you .
american	i would just say it 's ok .. it 's not great , just enough to get you by kinda food . your typical fare of scambled and hard boiled eggs , bacon , sausages , biscuits , etc . it 's a small buffet area compared to the others i 've been to . there are better ones for even better prices so do compare .
american	i 've only eaten the turkey club and drank beer here. twice during my last visit , once around 9pm friday night and again at around 4am sunday morning. it was food to absorb the alcohol that was in my system , and that 's about it .
american	as far as buffet 's go i have had better and i have had worse it was just ok
american	but they deliver on the shake so gave it and extra star for that . there is always a line and the place is always very busy . but the food is subpar , the hamburger patties are like jerky , and the fries are soggy . would not come back .
american	what is awful is that they charge 26 % tax ! there is no mention of any " ticket fees " anywhere on their pricing page . in the final step of paying they have " taxes and fees " added in , like any receipt , but at a rate of 26 % , not ontario 's 13 % . they are adding a 13 % fee without disclosing it anywhere , and attempting to hide it in the hst item on the receipt . the receipt does the same trick ( which is illegal under cra 's hst guidelines ) .
american	however , the staff is just awful . one of the hostesses was such a wreck during the rush , i didn 't catch her name but she was an older woman . and the manager , steven , wouldn 't even look at us in the eye when we asked him a simple question . the food is delicious but judging by the attitude of the staff and managers , they will not see a penny from me or my family again . i hear bellagio has an outstanding buffet and i 'm betting that their customer service skills are much more fine tuned .
american	it has all your favorite items ( or items that you tolerate when you have to eat at a bojangles ) and serves it up pretty quickly . the airport price-gouging mark up that you would find at any eatery in an airport is here , but given the bo 's normally low prices , it won 't hit you to hard in the wallet . biggest issue ? limited table seating . if the airport is even remotely busy , be prepared to have to carry it to your gate and balance your styrofoam container precariously upon your thighs while you try eat in the shitty faux-leather chairs .
american	i appreciate that you can get a salad instead of fries here . their burgers usualy seem fresher and better tasting too . however , this location appears to be one of the worst run wendy 's i 've ever been to . my salad not cold , was wilted , and had lots of brown bits . service was far from enthusiastic .
american	barely any sauce and they were so tough , at first i thought they were under-cooked . the fact that they are grilled doesn 't make them any less greasy , and there 's no crunch on the skin .
american	not a whole lot of good places to eat . it 's " not bad " but it definitely isn 't somewhere i would eat by choice . thought i would go simple on my first visit and get the pulled pork sandwich . it was dry . like really dry . like i could make it better and i barely know how to cook . in addition , the restaurant smells . they have carpet and you can just smell all the food and beverages that have been spilled and soaked into the floor . i would recommend driving up to bell road and finding something there .
american	you get the feeling that this is just another vfw or something with better decor and food ( debatable ... read on ) . the food : salty . you know how when you get a little toasty and you 're hungry , you seem to loooove salt ? i think they have whomever happens to be the drunkest at the bar when the first orders come in be the honorary line cook for the rest of the day. everything could be good but it turns out to be almost ok . if you 're drinking , you probably won 't care . if you 're getting take-out and planning on being totally sober , you will be disappointed .
american	there were 3 waitresses on staff that day yet we waited to be seated . we ordered one beer each and finished it before our meal came . someone from the kitchen brought it , and our waitress was over at the bar wiping the same spot for 15 minutes and zoning out . never came to check on us or get us refills until i flagged her down about 10 minutes after we finished to ask for our bill . then she asks if we would like a refill . but let 's not forget the stink eye she gave when she saw her tip . sorry sweetie , maybe you should have tried earning it . you 're lucky you got anything at all .
american	either people seem like it 's a hassel to wait on you or there 's something just a little off about a few people there . i 've only gone there a few times but rather take my business somewhere else .
american	simple food that will please a picky eater . no flavor . no taste .... perfect for the average american pallet . figured might be just that just average . went to another buffet and it was worth the price tag .. easy and convenient that 's about it
american	they get the order wrong by at least a little bit 1 / 3 of the time . and calling it " fast " food is kind of comical . but , if you 're in wilkinsburg ... well , this place is in wilkinsburg also . that 's about the best i can say . oh , and everyone is generally polite here . so they 've got that going for them .
american	the decor and location were great . my mom ordered the salmon which was 30 $ $ . we both expected a nice , large , pice of salmon but instead she got the cartilage and the skin . she informed the waiter and the waiter said she talked to the manager and there was nothing she could do about it and it was a " bad cut . " we were both very disappointed . i don 't know how this restaurant got more than 2 stars .
american	went on a friday , service was average and the bar area was loud with a rowdy party next to us . the food was normal pub fair done sloppy . ordered the california chicken sandwich and was underwhelmed with a side of fries that were ok . also ordered a cesar to start . it was an average salad with a dressing that appeared to be heavy on anchovies . all in all , there aren 't many fantastic options in the area and this definitely isn 't an option i 'll return to .
american	the burgers at least . the fries ? please . they are awful . let them get cold and they are worse than awful . anyone who says these are " the best burgers they have ever had " has just not tried enough good burgers yet . try lobby 's . or chuckbox . or hillside spot . or deluxe . or roaring fork . in-n-out has decent " fast food " burgers . but are they the best burgers anywhere ? not a chance .
american	as for the burger ... nothing really to write home about , but their crispy thin onion rings were quite tasty .
american	we picked the crest because it is local and i had heard good things about it . i looked on their website and on yelp ( of course ) and we were set to go . upon walking up to the door of the crest , we found a sign " closed dec 31 - jan 7 . " it would have been nice if they posted this closing on their website . everyone deserves time off and holidays but we were totally disappointed ! we ended up walking down the street to another place to eat .
american	the service is chaotic at best and the maître d ' is dr. jekyll and " miss " hyde . she bumped her friends in from the long wait line . the food ... let 's just say that gordon ramsey would have fired the chef . the steak was blended and they served frozen mixed vegetables with over cooked , frozen lobster tail . thank god we didn 't order any appetizers . i don 't want to think what it 'd taste like if they can mess up the daily specials .
american	# 1- stale popcorn chicken # 2- i have to ask for sauce # 3- no napkins -- i thought they had bad service for breakfast , but obviously its across the board .
american	when in the store , except great service . as for deliveries- there 's nothing freaky fast about it ! when a pizza delivery seems faster , you 're doing something wrong . serioisly , guys : 25-40 minutes for jimmy johns ? ! how bout no .
american	growing up in venango county i am familiar with the original in sharon , pa . quaker steak has to be on the mount rushmore of wing bars and because of that they 're relying on that 20 years later . service so slow it has to be on purpose to make you order more drinks . wings that have shrunk so much over the years it 's laughable , and inflated prices make me sick to think of what it used to be . what a shame because the buckeye barbecue and louisiana licker sauces are so good . qsl has let the fame go to their heads . go to a real local joint or buy the sauces at giant eagle .
american	wait staff were quite friendly . food was ok but again nothing out of the ordinary . if you are staying at harrahs the breakfast buffet is a far better choice .
american	the portions were large but the positives pretty much stop there for me . my philly cheesesteak wasn 't especially tasty . our waitress seemed like she was really unhappy to be working and always seemed eager to rush away from our table even though the restaurant was less than half full . in my next visit to the orleans hotel i won 't be dining at the courtyard cafe . there are better dining options as well as a food court .
american	as i am sitting here 2 other people here i have all u can eat pancakes send in to get more hear from the back i just made them why should i make more i guess the reviews on here are right this place is as bad in service the food was good but we will not be back here again and chuck the manger was rude like i did some thing wrong
american	aside from dandy service from bartender mckenzie , this was a thoroughly mediocre experience .
american	the decent service and the old vegas ambiance almost made up for the fact that i soiled myself before making it home . i highly recommend this joint if you 're looking for a meal that will ruin your night but not your figure .
american	the shrimp taco was something resembling day old tortillas dry rehydrated shrimp and pea soup . the bread was good . the steak was presented nicely but someone messed up . we asked for med. rare and got well done beyond recognition . we had waited for over an hour fur the charred hockey puck so just had to grin and bare it . won 't be back .
american	when i got my order my chicken was not cooked properly , it was still gooey in the middle and my fries we cold and soggy . when my husband took it back , the manager told him it wasn 't raw , and that he 'd have to wait 20 minutes for new chicken tenders . she rudely gave our money back and walked away without an apology . even in the mall , i still expect good customer service especially from a manager .
american	i unfortunately was among the trapped and came here with a group of friends ... i have literally nothing good to say about the food at all which is comparable to a large , messy chili-burger ordered from a snack bar at a little league baseball game . the service was equally bland in all areas and the food took ages to arrive . the best part of my experience was realizing that i wouldn 't ever have to come back to this gluttonous hive again .
american	but bees don 't have knees and i don 't have a positive review in me for this place . 1 star for service , though . -2 stars for the awful dj and exceptionally loud music . -countless stars for the fact that i 'm still barely able to keep food down a week later . also , the red velvet milkshake was terrible . the worst .
american	however , once we got the sliders back to my friends house we were both very disappointed that the sliders were completely unseasoned and lacked that delicious salty slider taste that were accustomed too . i also order a loaded chicago dog which i ate almost immediately , soggy wet mess , yes made by the same girl .. you know , it only takes one bad employee to ruin an experience forever . will probably not return as i made a special trip to check this place out after so many favorable reviews . i 'm still so very disappointed , love sliders .
american	always loved red robin but not this location . food was edible but not that great dishes and flat ware weren 't that clean . would not recommend to family and friends . most likely will not return to this location on future visits
american	the staff seemed like they wanted to be helpful , but just didn 't care . i don 't know what it was . anyhoo , if you like motorcycles and chicks in tight shirts ... ride your harley to a hooters . ooooorrr go here to the harley-davidson cafe. enjoy ,
american	wow ! unfortunately , the fact that it served subs to the people who take bullets for the president still does not make its subs anything special . of course , if you like lettuce , by all means , come here fast . if it 's the end of the world and i 'm craving a sandwich , i 'll throw a brick through the window of a subway--this location or any other subway . god knows they probably have , without fear of hyperbole , a million bags of vacuum-packed shredded lettuce under their counters . anyway , did i say that someone whose job it is to take a bullet for the president has eaten a sandwich from this subway ?
american	the service was excellent as the gentleman brought my order to my car , however , the food not so much . within the hour of consuming my sub i began to have stomach pain . to spare the gruesome details , 48 hours later , i am able to hold down a meal . it willbe a long while before i am able to consider ordering again . i 'll have to just keep it simple , i guess .
american	i hop decides to have construction workers drilling in the restaurant . very annoying . i swear every time i 'm at an i hop they 're doing some construction . do that shit when you 're closed and there 's no customers
american	not to mention , getting here at 7 : 30 and not receiving all of the food in a decent amount of time . at 9 : 00 we cancelled the remaining order that had not been received . after asking for the check twice it was in correct with items we didn 't even order . never had a bad experience with friday 's chain in any state until we go lt to sam 's town ....
american	since i arrived early and there was only one car already being worked on in front of mine , i was expecting a wait time no longer than 30 min . so i told them i 'd wait for my car inside their building . two hours later ..... my car was just sitting there , hood open , wrench on the engine , and absolutely no one in the garage at all . lesson learned , i 'll just go to good ol ' reliable jiffy lube next time .
american	2-piece leg & thigh ... well , they couldn 't even get that right . when i got home , they gave me a leg and a dried up half-breast . no wonder the place always looks empty .
american	first visit : above average burger , reasonable service . second visit 1 day later : miserable dry burger - half overcooked and dry , half undercooked and yet still dry , and not as ordered . waiter decided , rather than fixing it , to just hand us the rest of the order and let us try to sort it out . won 't bother to go back , no guarantee that it 'll be right .
american	i don 't eat meat and wasn 't in the mood for a veggie burger or to pay $ 21 for scallops so i tried a salad and app instead . the southern bean salad was dry and the beans were mush . the pimento cheese app was too salty to eat . the atmosphere and staff were great , but that 's not enough to bring me back , unfortunately .
american	my experience was just ok . service was very average , the wait was incredibly long for ordering eggs . the menu does say fruit with the eggs but upon arrival it appears only as a garnish with a small piece of pineapple and one strawberry slice . why bother to mention that in the description . i was there over an hour which was too long considering the simple order i placed . i wanted to love this place but it appears there are things that need to be worked out in the kitchen and with the service staff .
american	the market is saturated with burger joints so there are way better options out there .
american	it fed a group of hungry people but it was just like going to an old country buffet
american	the meatballs themselves were kind of flavorless and the sauce was insufficient for the already small portion . great location and kind of a fun atmosphere so i 'd like to say i 'll go back and try it again , but i can 't be sure .
american	now granted i 'm shoved into a corner like baby would have never accepted but i 'm desperately hungry and pickings are slim in terminal c. thinking 45 min is plenty of time to order a burger and choke it down before i fly away was a pipe dream of gargantuan proportions . my up charged ( $ 5 ) kobe burger alas was boxed for cold consumption aloft to the chagrin of my seat mates . but they wouldn 't box my million dollar hot grape juice to complete the awesome take away adventure .
american	we sat at sugar factory for 15 min on the patio with zero acknowledgment from our server . he walked past more then a few times and we saw he kept forgetting parts of orders and ignoring others as well . we then asked to move inside thinking perhaps it would be better . nope . the hostess knew we hadn 't been served outside thus should have alerted waitstaff but again we were ignored . waitstaff walked by no acknowledgement . out the door we went . hostess unfazed . never again . place was not full by any means either .
american	as i sit here we have been waiting for our waitress to bring back refills .... how long does it take for a root beer ..... the food was average and the service is trash ... she takes our refill order but refills the tables next to us first and still hasn 't come back .. been a good 15 minutes her name starts with a h ....
american	it 's even harder to believe that people patronize this place . it 's over priced , the service is terrible , and the food is just ok . the only reason i gave it 2 stars is cause the food was edible but not great .
american	in this case , it left no taste at all . this meal was the definition of bland . the crostini with chevre and mushrooms might as well have been toast with cheese . the risotto with shrimp and peas was dominated by the lemon juice - it was that flavorless . the rest of my family was similarly underwhelmed by the flavor . while the decor and ambience is pleasant , the prices are not indicative of the quality of the food .
american	this terminal only has one restaurant here and it 's this wendy 's . i feel like there is a lack of options here besides the abundance of clothing shop stores and ' news papers stands ' . having only one option here and not a healthy one is little disappointing ; come on wendy 's it 's time to pick up your game .
american	we had the flat liner fries with chili and cheese and they just weren 't good . i think there shakes are full of butter which seems fun until yourealise it just tastes like butter , which is good on toast but not so good in a thick shake . i think i thought the taste would make up for the calories but i was wrong ... staff seemed nice . it 's a pretty funny and irreverent restaurant but maybe the burgers are better than what we ordered .
american	on 12-28-16 the employees were out by the dumpster yelling and screaming at each other .. it was busy got a table for two right away . our server was awful . as soon as he walked up and greeted us all you smelled was cigarette smoke all over him ! ! ! ! ! nasty . i ordered the thai chicken bowl ask for sauce on the side and it came out wrong . there was hair in my girlfriend soup .. our waiter never came and asked us how are food was or refilled our drinks . we will not be back .
american	i was just hoping that maybe it was a pizza that wasn 't being sold . while placing my order i saw one of the cooks was eating food where the food was being prepped . i witnessed him licking his fingers and then sticking his fingers in a bowl and then licking his fingers again . this is enough to keep me away . it 's a shame because this was our offices go to pizza shop .
american	she asked for help and was told by manager she couldn 't cause she was on her cell . another manager is always outside on his cell . i left as it didn 't look like they would bother ringing me up on next register . fries are good , the reason i go .
american	after several months of success i have to say my love has waned . i 've found the quality has dropped significantly : recently my grilled cheese was barely cooked and was soaking in butter . i 'd even asked for it to be well-done . gross . i still love their fries though .
american	tatziki sauce how ever you spell it no thank you the best thing about the place was the soda fountain . it is one of those new coke machines that make 1000 different combinations .
american	this is the most ridiculous and disrespectful thing i 've ever encountered . don 't walk around in your uniform around tables if you aren 't prepared to do your job . unbelievable
american	when we came to our room , it was a double fool . called the front desk and said they don 't have any 1 king . rude front desk people . drove 5 hours to get here . some bs
american	super full of herself ignored me the whole time i was sitting there waiting for a drink .
american	bartender then proceeded to take the menus as if its common for people to change their mind on ordering food . no thanks on trying the food here if that 's the case . will not be back .
american	no butter ... ordered french toast . deliver driver couldn 't even give me a $ 5 back for change . last time , i ordered a milk shake with my burger ... no straw . i won 't order from them until i 'm told they have tightened up a bit . considering the lackadaisical effort , the $ 1 delivery charge is a crock of shit . food is usually alright from what i remember . was alright this time . i 'm still all set with them .
american	asked for a quarter pounder blt - missing the l everyone was too busy chatting away to even focus on how busy it was
american	didn 't mind the lower floor with no view since we got a good deal from mlife but the noise is not acceptable . heard the door open and slam shut throughout the night and as a result barely got any sleep . it didn 't help the sound proofing is very poor in the units and buckets being kicked around . construction early in the morning ? thanks a lot for making our stay pleasant . won 't ever come back to this property again .
american	asked specifically for salami and yellow mustard . they gave a 3 year old spicy mustard . very disappointed . whether the counter or the kitchen there is no excuse .
american	when i got my sandwich i could clearly see that there was once avocado on it , but their failed attempt to remove it from the sandwich did not go unnoticed . on the other sandwich , we asked for extra sauce ... instead they put no sauce . with my soup , there were no crackers . i 'm a bit disappointed in this place and considering i 've come here many times , i 've come to expect consistency , which did not match this visit .
american	too many teenagers make our food in this world . one adult burger chef should be hired at each in and out , otherwise this will keep happening . what are teenagers really good for anyway ? after complaining to corporate , will receive replacement burgers . they are very nice on the customer service phone line .
american	asked for sauce on wings and got no sauce on the wings .
american	oh and some of them were so undercooked they were still cold ! when they brought our food out one order was completely wrong - so i uncomfortably ate alone because my dining guest insisted . the cinnamon roll had been nuked so it was really tough . egg scramble was good . thumbs down overall tho ...
american	i make it betta with a bottle of walker 's from the supermarket . chicken was tasteless . ribs were 90 % bone and grizzle . macaroni was good but i don 't order from a caribbean restaurant to get a plate of pasta . very disappointed .
american	edit this cause i just had a bite of my burger. horrible .. threw the whole meal away. wasted $ 8 thanks burger king
american	the waitress and manager were very polite , and offered me a refund , and i know some people prefer their burgers this way ... but for a burger , i don 't want to see pink .
american	the mushrooms tasted like they 're cooked in dirt .
american	where 's the pink ? asked for apple butter got regular butter .. the only thing good was the pancakes and lemonade .. and the service was horrible ..
american	got a small soup and a cherry . thanks for caring about food allergies chick fil a
american	also my glass of water ended up having a ring of chocolate syrup at the bottom !
american	got burnt wings . not a hard job to cook wings on a grill .
american	bartender said there is a charge foe samples ! no way . will not be going back . good breweries do not charge for samples !
american	got a side salad with dressing mixed in . ordered a meatball sub , the bread was so stale that i wasn 't able to bite through it . i told the waitress she gave me a sad look but didn 't respond , didn 't offer to replace or partial refund . disappointing . atmosphere was decent thats why this place gets 2 / 5 stars .
american	a terrible smell kept coming back , even despite the efforts of the hostesses and their over-spraying of air freshener throughout the entire space . the air freshener was not a good mix with my food either . the plus , great bartender who kept the drinks coming and made sure to keep tabs on the slow food order .
american	mediocre sub , nothing too good , not terrible . had a vanilla milkshake that i couldn 't drink , had a funny taste . overall i won 't be returning .
american	what a waste of $ 11 . i was the only person in your establishment and you still couldn 't make my sandwich right . thanks for nothing
american	i said i don 't want any spicy . it comes and is spicy . when told it was spicy i was told " that 's the coleslaw in top ... " really ? lemon curd is delicious . nice concept but will not be back . my waffles using krusty 's are much better. and the bacon was yucky
american	i 'm a gal and this is why he wouldn 't describe it in case that wasn 't already obvious . yes , in the year 2015 someone who works with the public thinks it is totally okay to say that apparently . crazy . did not have much there foodwise but what i did have was not that great . won 't be going back again due to the odd , rude and very inappropriate service .
american	everything from my buffalo wings to my wife chicken strip were dry . my kid chicken strip was dry , that he had to peel the outside off just to try and find any decent part in the middle . all our $ $ for today on food went to waste we threw it all away and are very mad . don 't eat from this wingstop !
american	our party of 6 was extremely disappointed as soon as we saw the seafood spread . variety was actually pretty good , but nothing screamed quality . i would not pay the extra for the seafood if i were to do it again . the regular buffet was an ok value but there are much better buffets for a few bucks more such as the wicked spoon at the cosmopolitan .
american	asked steak well showed the manager she was a little nice nasty about the situation when we asked for a desert , but she did offer to take six bucks off .
american	i didn 't know i wasn 't eating fresh eggs until i heard a guy ask for some and they broke out the whites and cracked ' em in the pan .
american	ask for ketchup in drive tru and got one packet of ketchup lol what am i supposed to do with that wow
american	ask for over med eggs and received over hard didn 't care for the what they call home fries , service ok .
american	i don 't care if you add bacon to the meal , it 's still mac and cheese . service was not great . i had to go back up to the counter several times after our food was delivered to get items that were supposed to be included with the meal . only thing the kids loved was the free sucker at the end . horray .
american	this location seems to have nose-dived . staff are flustered and not trained properly , no matter what i order it comes out wrong or not cooked properly . i love a lot of things on the menu but it 's frustrating when they are made differently every time you order them . i once ordered the rck poutine , to my surprise ... someone forgot the cheese . i 'm giving up for a few weeks . will try again when they 've got themselves sorted out .
american	she informed me they were closing the section . but they continued seating customers in the section i requested . our waitress was busy and did a great job . food was ok . kkh
american	i used to eat here a lot till i got hair in 3 sandwhich 's . two where on the same day . hell no will i go back
american	clean , bright , well decorated . when i arrived , the line to get in was 8-10 deep , so i went for the bar . surprisingly , the line disappeared in under 5 mins - good on them . the veggie burger filled the void in my stomach , but did little for the satisfying my taste buds . i think i look a little harder the next time i go through the toronto airport . tip : if you order a salad , ask for the dressing on the side as the volume they put on , is probably more than most would like .
american	hate the womens ' outfits-- half of them don 't fit in the uniform anyway . burgers were decent . my partner enjoyed his build a burger . the meat was cooked well . but my lamb burger was sopping with butter . overpriced . dark . slow . not the worst place i 've been , but i certainly would never go again .
american	that 's what i got when i ordered a chicken sandwich . there was nothing in the chicken salad except chicken and mayonaise and more mayo . unfortunately , i asked for may to be spread on the bread , but they plopped pints of it . it was not tasty . the chicken salad wasn 't appetizing at all . the chocolate shake was great though . it 's the next morning and i 'm still feeling queezy thinking about that sandwich .
american	we enjoyed breakfast at 24 seven in the past because the prices were good , there was great variety ( breakfast all day ! ! ) , and the portions matched the pricing . we went today and found everything had changed and now food is overpriced , tiny , and the selection is minimal . we stayed because i had a voucher for my birthday , but we will not be returning by choice . the chicken and waffles sounds exciting but costs about $ 15 . the second star is only because the staff are consistently kind and quick with the coffee refills .
american	on our most recent visit we sat for 25 mins before we even received water . the food is mediocre at best - fajitas with a ton of filler and little meat , caprese salad with less than fresh vegetables , etc . location is great but will not be back with all the other dining options in port credit .
american	as long as you continue to support the nfl who disrespects our flag , disrespect our country , and disrespect the national anthem i will no longer be spending my money here .
american	for the price i highly recommend meatheads or an even better place is ferren 's . five guys is just a tourist trap . they lure in out of towners that just don 't know any better .
american	the crowd here ( when we came ) is more on the older side . i ordered the special menu of the night which was a pork loin medallion with potatoes and roasted vegetables and my bf ordered the new york steak . the portion size is pretty small for the price . the pork loin medallions were just 3 pieces and very tiny . the taste is good though . it just needed a tad of salt . the sauce had madeira and mushrooms . the new york steak was also flavorful because of the chimichurri sauce on it . we didn 't have the chance to try their desserts . maybe next time .
american	most of the food was either too salty or too bland . want a soda ? they only have all the alternate brands . want coke ? they have pepsi . want sprite , they have sierra mist . imo , that 's a bit odd for a buffet . most important thing to note : my group of six all ended up getting diarrhea . one of us actually vomited about six times the following day--and we didn 't even drink ! waste of money .
american	we were there on a tuesday in march night and every time the door opened , a giant fan blew cold air into the restaurant . the restaurant was not crowded , service was prompt , however entrees arrived when we were still working on appetizers . i had crab cake benedict - very good , and tuna - which had no flavor . my wife had lobster bisque - excellent and lobster mac and cheese - ok . very nice selection of beers . overall , not worth the price .
american	) go to the shiloh grill or the harris grill for their far superior sunday brunch buffet extravaganza at half the price of the grand concourse brunch buffet ...
american	i work at a business close by and there are 150 other people who also work here . we have almost all eaten at jim 's and almost all of us won 't go back because of how terribly we were treated by this woman . i don 't expect to be treated like royalty , especially at a hole in the wall place like this , but i do expect to be treated with decency when i 'm spending my money there . the food is good , but in my opinion , nothing is worth being treated with such disrespect .
american	i sat outside because the weather was great , but was pretty much forgotten for most of the time . why are the bartender 's taking tables ? of course they can 't attend to their tables properly because they are supposed to man the bar . secondly , if you change waitresses that doesn 't mean i want my check . i was just disappointed today because i was neglected the entire time . i also didn 't get bread , extra plates or a napkin under my drink like usual . what 's the issue today ?
american	i work the 3rd shift and went to get some lunch . i asked for diet coke and got a dr pepper i thought they shorted me my onion rings but really shorted me my chicken.twinkle toes didn 't give me my receipt . bad service bad food .
american	we ordered a side of fries , to share , but they were quite soggy / cold and dripping in oil ( shocking , i know ) . unfortunately , i don 't think i would go back here . i had high hopes for our experience but the ambience ended up being a little lacklustre and i would rather something a little more heart healthy next time .
american	it took a waiter about 15 minutes to even acknowledge our presence , and then nearly an hour to get our burgers , with no apologies offered . it 's a shame , as the restaurant has a nice ambiance and concept . however , customer service is tantamount and in this area , art : brgr fell completely short .
american	as much as i love the mother road lost highway this is my second time here and the service is horrible and very unwelcoming for a bar .
american	this particular bj 's really needs to get it together . there booth chairs had crumbs all over it . the menu had dried up old food . lastly the bathroom , the first 3 stalls had no tissue . smh . come on i could hve gobe to jack in the box for this or any fast food for tht matter ! ! !
american	overpriced and simply not good . proof that being famous doesn 't mean you can cook . the place looks hip and cool and well designed but the food has a long was to go before it 's even good . bad service and and rushed servers . the outfits the poor women had to wear made most of them look like overinflated balloons . made me think twice about getting a fatty burger when you see some of these servers running around that could hardly fit into the horrible outfits management deemed suitable . everything is overpriced and honestly nothing tastes good . sorry gordon maybe you should start offering a burger at mcdonalds at least the quality would be better .
american	i can make a better cup at home . i still like the location and the staff friendliness , just not the coffee .
american	the staff is wonderful , great selection of drinks , but the food is just ... eh . the american potato chips are delicious as are the fries . but when you venture past that , it gets hit or miss . the garlic chicken pasta was so greasy i could hardly eat it . the classic philly is great , but the french dip is ( according to my hubby ) really doesn 't have much taste . we 'll try again , hoping that they 've worked the kinks out of the place .
american	slightly sweeter sauce and cheese that falls off the slice exposing the plain , kind of boring pizza . i would only go if you had some kind of coupon , even then its hard to compete with the $ 10 ' many topping ' specials going on everywhere else now .
american	this review starts with what all other yelpers have commented on and that is the rude ass lady who takes your money . bigger lady with glasses . throws my number almost at me and let 's me know that they do not have grapefruit juice right now with major attitude . after the wait for food i get my omelette but of course no silverware . then when i ask if i can have some the waitress asks " does everyone here need silverware " ? ? ? ? ? ? wtf lol . 4 big hungry dudes . no we eat with our hands . they need to be happy people still go and treat people better . would never go back
american	sloppy , sloppy , sloppy . equally important to us is how the staff tolerates f-bombs from all the sh * t-kickers who come here with their pea brains . can never bring my kids here . the staff do nothing because i suppose the booze brings in more money than the food . heart and soul is just a few yards away and while they don 't have the tvs-galore , the food is better and the environment is much more family-friendly . this place needs to die a quick death .
american	yeah it 's $ 5 , but it 's not that good compared to other takeout pizzas like north end pizza , hungry howies , and even dominoes and pizza hut ! just not all that , and i don 't need to eat that again
american	seriously so disappointed . every visit lately has been negative . the workers are not friendly . we never seem to see a manager / owner . this particular day we waited for almost 30 minutes for sandwiches . correction-45 minutes ! ! !
american	the minute we walked in we received poor service and it was dead in there . our utensils were dirty and the food was average . one good thing was our server did a great job . we were looking forward to the experience but it wasn 't worth our time .
american	the food was identical to what you get for a continental breakfast in a hotel , except at a hotel it 's warm . my food was all cold and mushy . even the toast was mushy . how do you mess up toast ? ? ? how hard is it to freshly toast bread before bringing it to me ? this restaurant should either take their breakfast offering up a notch or stop serving breakfast . their current offering is only going to turn away new customers .
american	the waiter explained that the sauces are pre-packaged and they do not control the taste while arguing that sauce was not sweet . if i was at ihop with a plate of pancakes the sauce would have been perfect .
american	the cooks kept watching us as we talking to each other like they were wanting to leave . when we sat down the waitress told the cook that there were three people to be served and he through a fit . the eggs were not cooked all the way and the bacon and ham look as if it has been sitting for hours . other than that it was alright .
american	i 've been here on occassion ... i fear won 't be anymore . although our server was gracious her manager gave a half hearted apology . our meals were redone . my meal was better , the wife 's not much more . now i just discovered the digital pay unit was for another table . the hits just keep coming . to say i 'm never coming back would be an understatement .
american	the rest of the staff is nice , the manager should learn from the staff . my daughter ordered the chocolate pancake and it was horrible ! we will never be back again .
american	i noted the young overly tattooed man who i am assuming was our waiter was very busy engaged in horseplay with many other employees by the main entrance . once we were acknowledged by dropping off menus to our table and saying i will be back , he left to continue his conversation at the main entrance of the restaurant . as we walked by him to leave all he did was laugh . i truly think management should be held accountable at this restaurant for their lack of oversight . i will never return to a place that doesn 't value my business .
american	well , i wish we hadn 't . the food was tasteless and bland . i should have known right away we were in trouble when i saw how large the menu was . it is all over the board with fried fish and flat bread pizza to street tacos . my wife had the spaghetti squash & zucchini . she said it was terrible . i had the cowboy burger and was not impressed at all . the onion ribbons were cold and the bun was not very fresh . overall , just not very good at all . there are much better places to eat right in the same retail center .
american	$ 11 for a dinky 7.5 inch quiznos sub ? no thanks . very disappointing ! i used to always grab a chili and a sandwich from here for non meal service flights , but i refuse to support the new price gouging going on here . there 's even a new handwritten sign above the soda fountain that reads " refills are 85 cents . " come on , man !
american	been coming to a few locations for years and only this past year and a half have i been annoyed with the vibe , the service , the price and quality of the food lately . i feel more satisfied getting more vegetables from chipotle and pizza rev. cheaper and more satisfying . healthier options are open and it 's not as preppy feeling in the establishment . they have hot sauces at the other places . go elsewhere imo
american	my meal was not memorable , and the only thing my husband remebered was the main course of pork , which was quite good . the crab cake appetizer was a mess . the beet salad was puny , but good flavor . i won 't beat the dead horse with a stick . if menu offerings and prices don 't change , there could be another vacancy in dc market--very unfortunate for us who live in north scottsdale .
american	the atmosphere is cool , they offer a gluten free pizza , and i always prefer a decent byob . the problem is the wait staff culture here . we have gone here at 4-5 times now and each time it is the same lousy service and we are disappointed yet again . if you read the reviews , it is definitely a recurring theme that is not being addressed . hoping they read this ( and all the others ) and understand they need to hire people with some social skills !
american	the menu is heavily focused on pita . the spinakopita is very dry , and might be something prepackaged not house made . the moussaka tends to be runny . for a restaurant that claims to be greek , what are provolone and mozzarella doing in the entrees ? long time byob , which is uncivilized ! perhaps they have forgotten greece has some good wines .
american	we 're here on a wed mid-morning , and there are many empty tables , only 4 tables filled in the front area and a couple in the side room . considering that , service is very , very slow in the kitchen . our 2 omelettes took over 35 minutes to arrive . the kitchen must be backed up but not sure with whose meals . glad we 're not in a hurry . 2nd time here , likely not coming back . as a former grill cook , breakfast is easy and fast and should not take this long .
american	we waited for about 40 min . the hubby got the famous breakfast burrito . he said it was good , but it was definitely missing something . also , the flavor profile was only " chorizo . " we have had better . i got the huevos rancheros . good , but also lacking something . we split a pumpkin pancake , and a cinnamon bun pancake . the pumpkin was great , but the cinnamon bun was still completely raw in the middle , like , oozing batter , which was gross . good overall , not great . we have had better . gonna try pamelas next ...
american	the presentation of the food was beautiful . however , our dinner really wasn 't good . there was just no getting around the fact that we didn 't enjoy the flavor . no plates went back to the kitchen licked clean . i get that the price point is low and they are trying to provide a higher end experience for a very reasonable price . i don 't think this will work though until they use higher quality ingredients and improve their flavor . service was also spotty . again , i understand the servers are volunteers and i respect that . we could tell , however , that the staff weren 't servers in their day jobs .
american	pluses are the location , value and friendly attentive staff . food is pretty okay , no real " wow " factor but okay all the same . the burger is a lump of meat in an egg bun ... no contrast in textures within ( ie no crunch ) , and the spanakopita is good enough albeit uninspired . 2 1 / 2 / 5
american	this includes management , who disappears just like the servers do . hostesses are useless and have no idea how to interact with guests . this place won 't last .
american	the atmosphere was nice if you can snag a booth , more cozy than the sports bar further up the concourse . the burger was a bit overdone , as were the panko chicken tenders . bbq sauce is the sauce of choice . the wines were of acceptable quality , at least if you are going to pay a high price you get something that is ok .
american	i tried the country style steak with green beans and corn . it also says delivery available on their website but when called to have delivered to hotel next door they said they don 't deliver . still wanted to try it out since it was close and not a big chain- was disappointed with the food that i got . it wasn 't horrible ... just nothing great as these kind of country places usually can be .
american	we arrived about 1pm and couldn 't find any parking ( maybe because the hotel was full ? ) . finally found parking on the street after 15 minutes . it would be nice if there was some reserved parking for the restaurant . food was good , but seemed over priced for the diner atmosphere . i had the green bowl and my friends had pancakes for $ 10 a piece . ( it 's just $ 5.50 at ncounter on mill ave for pancakes ) server was nice , but the service was painfully slow considering there were only a handful of other tables . it was also freezing in there even though it was 110 degrees outside .
american	food is really mediocre especially given it 's location . i will go watch a game and have a beer but i eat before i go ; )
american	some of the games are just plain rip-offs as well , such as their virtual bowling simulator which has messed up sensors ( throw the ball down the center and it detects it as a gutter ? ? ) or their $ 1.50 / play operation game which ended after 15 seconds with no warning . with all that said , there are a couple of redeeming things about the place . some of the arcade games are fun , and you 'll have a lot to try if you like racing games . they also have pool tables , though again , many of them were out of order . look in the free local discount books for some gameworks coupons .
american	if they can 't figure out the water situation they should at least be providing bottled water or some sort of filtered option ! we split a pizza which was okay at best , but greasy and really salty . my ' kale quinoa salad ' was literally just a mound of kale with maybe a 1 / 2 teaspoon of quinoa sprinkled on top , with a few cranberries and very little dressing . the prices were high for what was served to us as well . if you 're looking for a similar restaurant with much better food , three palms in hudson absolutely blows this place out of the water .
american	my coffee was lukewarm , the fries they served looked old , seating is limited , you need to be buzzed into the bathroom ( which was covered in puke this particular monday night ) . the only good thing is that they 're 24 / 7 . but aren 't most mcdonalds ?
american	i had a field of greens salad and half dozen blue points and was incredibly ill just short of the point of going to the hospital . i could overlook their snootiness if they would try harder to not serve food that could kill the patrons .
american	the first clue was the appearance of green peppers -- perhaps the ultimate hack topping when it comes to preparing pizza . they 're attempting stromboli , which i initially found interesting , but unfortunately there 's green peppers inside . many of the counterstaff remain , and they 're still nice , but the blunt truth is that this is not the unique example it was before . all my earlier gushing is almost completely invalid now . i 'll keep the review up as nostalgia , but please don 't take it seriously . it describes the past , not the present .
american	there was one girl working . she served as the hostess , waitress , and bus person all at once . she may have been cooking also . she was on her toes and did a great job stopping at every table . the food . burgers were average at best , nothing making them stand out . the fries were the best part of the meal . also shared some wings . the were pretty bad in my opinion . not returning here !
american	but the lower than average rating is because on 2 separate occasions they got our order wrong . i don 't mean forgetting no cheese or something , i mean the sandwich delivered ( chicken tenders on a roll ) wasn 't the one ordered ( a hamburger ) . the receipt showed the right things ... but someone is sloppy / lazy in assembling the orders for the girls to bring out . that 's wasteful , mr. manager .... get your act together !
american	we waited 20 + minutes after ordering for the soup and salad course . the prime rib was dry , horseradish sauce was bland , the burger i ordered medium-well came to the table well-done . brussels sprouts were undercooked . each time he approached our table after the food was served , our server made comments about how his " mouth was watering , " and how our food " looked very good . " when i 'm at a restaurant , i don 't want to be told how my food looks when it is served , or how much the person serving my food wants to eat it . very unappetizing and unprofessional , and we will not be back .
american	if you must experience this fixture of pittsburgh dining , do it one time only . the floors are littered with the coleslaw and fries of previous customers . my server was lackadaisical at best ; i would have preferred to have served myself or just not eaten that night . what a colossal waste of calories that could have been spent on fresh bread , hot fries , and decent cole slaw , three things you won 't find at this pittsburgh ' icon ' .
american	the restaurant was not busy , as it was early morning still , and the staff seemed forgetful . asked for water , and didn 't get it until the waitress was reminded . the smoked meat was thin , and did not seem fresh at all . prices were a little exorbitant . the design of the restaurant unfortunately makes sitting at any table near the door a cold experience . not recommended . food was nothing special .
american	i definitely would not pay to eat here if it wasn 't for the bob . the variety was miniscule and the food was just mediocre . there was a burrito bar where you can make your own burrito with either carne asada or chicken asada . both meats tasted like crap so i didn 't have a burrito . the guacamole didn 't taste like real avocados . the prime rib was ok and all that special . the service was also pretty slow . our waitress disappeared for a period of time and was a real disappointment here . overall , not one of the buffets i would choose to go to next time around for the bob .
american	to sit and visit while enjoying your drinks was interrupted by a waitress trying to get an order while half the restaurant was empty . the food -salads ok , entrees - shrimp was dry and tasteless , scallops small plate was not inspiring , beef kabob was not good either , but my filet was very nice . having had good meals in the past and to go to an upscale top restaurant and receive this annoying service and less than stellar food is very disturbing and i would think it will be a long time before we return . i was embarrassed in choosing this restaurant and felt bad that our friends had to pay so much for so little on a thursday night .
american	we usually have a great time at bacchanal , but when we went there on july 16 we were disappointed . the service was terrible , the food staff in the seafood section was careless and unfriendly , the food quality was not up to par , the seafood was frozen , the meat in the sliders were dry , and you had to crack the heated crab yourself . i will not be returning to bacchanals anytime soon .
american	too big and family oriented to be a real sports bar . too noisy and eh in the food department to be a real family restaurant . a real divey bar or a decent casual restaurant would be better .
american	ubereats it is . walk outside to get my food from uber , plenty of unused tables in their outdoor area .
american	compared to the sunset grill its a five . compared to coras five minute drive south on weston its a 1 . pickle barrel beats them too . woodbridge prices .
american	i just left there . took twenty minutes to get a sandwich going through drive thru , and there where that many cars their . i 'll not be going back
american	.. i am really rooting for this restaurant on a service level to iron out the kinks and rise above its competitors . .. i mean the food is good , but they keep missing the boat as far as stellar service . .. the kitchen is slow and they often appear very confused , and when you on your lunch break , prompt ticket times are a must . .. come on ya 'll . .. i 'm rooting for you . .. invest in some training for service and watch your business blow all barbeque spots out of the box ... service is the key ; consistent stellar service !
american	as for the calamari , its 4 tempura fried pieces for 13 dollars , over priced and nothing special . the oysters and mussels were however quite tasty and fresh . as for main entrees , my boyfriend and i had linguini with seafood and mac and cheese . the mac and cheese was tasty yet the mussel in the linguini was not fresh and left a disgusting odour and taste , i ended up leaving it behind . service was average , i 've had better experiences elsewhere .
american	sure there are a lot of food options for breakfast at the buffet here but none of the offer much in taste and make you want to go back for seconds . the only thing i enjoyed here was the frozen yogurt , which is pretty difficult to mess up . worst meal i had on my trip and will definitely not go back again . you can put your money down on that .
american	i ate here on november 24th , 2009 . would not eat here again . sorry , i know this review sort of stinks compared to my other ones , i just cannot express how much i dislike this place . not the worst , but i prefer denny 's .
american	pop 's looks like pat 's ! however , i got a cheesteak , with whiz , onions , and peppers- but they forgot the flavor . everything about it was bland . i couldn 't differentiate between the meat and the onions . it was weird . and the bread was awful- it was soft and did not taste like an amoroso . looks were most definitely deceiving . that said , the patio is great ! and so were the sweet potato fries .
american	the music was loud , the dressing was shameful , and our server was rachet . the fried okra was good , but you could get the same from " churches chicken . " the cornbread and sweet tea were on point , but not good enough to tolerate our server saying " ya 'll black , but we get a lot if ni # @ as in here . " food but not soul food .
american	as a challenge , i decided to try out what they were calling a burger . i had the bbq veggie burger , which came with the quinoa onion rings on top . while flavourful , the patty was dry and reminded me of turkey stuffing . it was a big burger but pressing it down actually made the patty fall apart as well . the sweet potato fries that everyone raves about were adequate at best . nice atmosphere and i was assured that their rice bowls are delicious . just don 't go here expecting to be converted .
american	every one who has never had the original please do not think that this is what it is like ! the one in vegas seems as if the chili is out of a can and the hot dogs are not as good and the bun wasnt warmed up and the fries werent seasoned fries and the ranch was very liquidy and the bacon was limp and not crispy at all. i was very disappointed ! ! ! ! but as soon as i got back to la i went to pinks and regained my love for their hotdogs .... but i will never ever go back to the one in vegas ... so not worth the money = /
american	pop 's gets props for the amoroso rolls , but the cheesesteak was completely flooded with cheese whiz and overall lacking in flavor . i love the building though ( it 's an old converted wienerschnitzel ) and the neon and logo . they do have tastykakes and frank 's sodas ( ! ) , so if you are craving some black cherry wishniak , pop 's is your go-to place . i 'll try pop 's again maybe and get the provolone instead of the whiz , but my initial assessment is that there are better cheesesteaks in this town . most of the other reviews already have the alternatives covered .
american	the food is just not that great . we ordered nachos and the chicken was still cold . we ended up sending them back . i ordered a root beer , it has alcohol and they allowed the ice cream to completely melt before bringing it to the table . its just disappointing . id rather go to holsteins or even smashburger before i actively choose stripburger again !
american	in 5 + trips since moving to gastonia , i 've yet to have a trio where either the wait was more than 15 minutes for no more than 2 people , or the order was wrong . their intercom system doesn 't work well and the waitresses often don 't read you back a total and have even lost my order altogether . i 've given them multiple opportunities but after today am done . i 'll save my sonic visits for trips out of town and recommend the same to you .
american	while the decorations are ok , ( some far better than others ) i have to say that the cake is consistently dry and crumble , without much flavor . some of the fillings are ok , and some have a funky texture , reminiscent of shortening maybe ? the icing leaves a lot to be desired as well . cakes from other outlets are generally far superior . while kitchen staff usually fights for leftovers , cakes from freed 's usually end up in the garbage .
american	every time i come to this arby 's it takes me at least 15 mins to get my food ; it doesn 't matter if i go inside or go through the drive thru . sheesh , they move like molasses here . they always have cold fries . but what else can you expect after spending 15 mins waiting for your food ? why do i return you ask ? because i just can 't stay away from the meats ! and those fries ... they 're just so ... curly .
american	the service was good , but ....... the food was mediocre at best , the bread was burnt , the linguini with clams was way too salty , , , , yes , yes we were warned about that as if that is the way its supposed to taste .... it but it sounded more like an excuse for a botched dish . way too expensive for the type of food served . i will never go back .
american	he rejected my id and made us move away from the bar . he then looked at my friends id and said this is not you even though we had her sister with the same last name at the table . he continued to be very rude and did not offer an apology for his mistake , nor did he engage in any sort of conversation .
american	unlucky for us that 's what we were looking forward to . got the drinks from the soda machine and noticed they didn 't have any to go lids . i asked if they had any lids and they said nope only the domed lids for the shakes which they couldn 't make . to top it off they fed my kids raw chicken strips . stay far far away . sad they used to be my favorite . * update * they did make us two free chicken strip meals but hopefully my daughter doesn 't get sick
american	the menus were sticky and obviously never wiped clean . the pizza looked pretty but that was about it . way too much cheese and it was not even cooked .... still doughy ... waste of money
american	i was very close to walking out but my husband wanted to stay . the waitress was snotty at first , coming by every 2 min to see if we were ready to order . buffalo chicken bites- they were plain and had a little taste of freezer burn . spinach artichoke dip- has a taste of being processes and not fresh . cobb salad with chicken- this was actually good . the chicken had flavor and was tender . burger- the first one had a hair in it that was discovered half way thru the burger . we told the waitress and she was very sincere . the manager delivered a new fresh burger with no issues . the burger tasted great .
american	lots of tv 's yes but exposed clutter wires . good specials listed out side but never offered by staff . over priced chicken parmigiana . was swimming in sauce and the noodles were not drained properly . employees hanging out drinking at the bar what seemed like on the clock as you see them in and out of the kitchen . ac kicked on like it was 100 * degree outside
american	apparently they have pizza as well ( guess they left the oven behind ? ) .
american	the food is decent , but not worth the trip from silverado ranch . the fried chicken was decent at best . chicken was bland , sauces were too sweet ... or right in to hot . breading was either too thick or fatty , if that make sense . the tenders were really good as were the fries with gravy ! biggest set back was the pricing . although it 's a fast food style , be ready to spend full-service prices .
american	some of the food for dinner is decent , but it doesn 't even rise to the quality of some of the lower end station casino properties and offers a surprisingly small selection with part of the serving area permanently closed . desserts here are ok , a slight notch above the rest of the meal . edible , but simply not worth the money .
american	getting to and from the restaurant requires you plow through clouds of cigarette smoke ( unless you arrive by boat : ( ) . once there , the entrees are very overpriced and the quality is not that good . the carpeting where the waitstaff walk to and from the kitchen is worn to the threads ... doesn 't bode well for they may maintain the restaurant in general .
american	if your palate isn 't particularly refined , you 'll probably love it , and they had a special kids section , if the children in your party are the chicken fingers / mac n cheese / pizza crowd . otherwise , the food was only okay . it 's worth going to if you 're staying in the hotel and don 't feel like going elsewhere , but it 's nothing to write home about . for a really amazing buffet experience , i suggest the wynn .
american	i 've been here a couple of times because it is a couple of steps from my office , but i won 't be returning . the food , at best , is mediocre . the service is also sub-par . i waited 40 minutes for a tuna sandwich with fries . the restaurant wasn 't busy , patrons that came in long after i did received quicker service and to top it off , the sandwich was salty and the fries were bland and under cooked . don 't waste your time and money - there are plenty of other spots in the neighborhood .
american	i was put off by the " sides . " you had to pay extra for a baked potato or corn . you get access to the " salad bar , " if you really want to call it that . it was lettuce out of a bag , cucumbers , tomatoes , and cold green beans ( out of a can . ) if you are going to charge me over $ 20 for a piece of meat , the least you guys could do is provide sides that are fresh and not bought from costco . very disappointing .
american	part of the steak was made carbonized , barely edible . although the manager took the steak from the check , but the dinner and the whole night were ruined . just so disappointed .
american	it came out well done . no attempt to resolve the issue by the waitstaff when we complained .
american	i 've been here twice , hoping the first time was just a fluke . the first time the appetizers took an hour and a half to get . the second time we ordered the special of the night , as did the table next to us , all five steak were cooked well done when everyone ordered rare to medium rare . i also heard someone in a large group behind me mention something similar . none of the non-steak items have been memorable or worth mention either . i 'm sincerely disappointed , as i had great hopes for this place . it just doesn 't cut it . i gave it two stars for decent cocktails .
american	we had four in our party , one steak medium rare , two mediums and one medium well . all cooked medium . don 't get me wrong it was a nice cut of meat at a reasonable price , but that 's useless if your cooks suck . be very specific about how you want your beast cooked .
american	for a chain , not bad to bet on consistency but don 't sit at the bar long because it will cost you . a round of drinks ( 5 ) for $ 130 is not my idea of fun . big steaks , big sides but avoid the beaten path and try something new !
american	won 't be back - i can buy fish sticks at the store - this is basically what this was . we had two orders of 5 piece fish and chips that were edible . unremarkable and certainly not worth the money .
american	pizza with prosciutto and arugula resembled cracker bread with a meat volcano on top . waitress seemed to think the pizza was the best thing ever but she also looked like she didn 't discriminate against too many meals . great ice water though ! high quality stuff on the rocks .
american	sure , the price ( $ 6.99 / lunch ) seems low , but when you come face to face with the food , it screams blandness , unhealthiness , and low quality . the lunch selections include a taco bar with greasy , high-fat beef , a salad bar that attempts to imitate sweet tomatoes but it comes up far short , some other low-quality chinese and italian options and a dessert bar . so , if you are searching for a buffet , i highly suggest that you continue the search and pay a few bucks extra per person for a higher quality and better selection elsewhere . learn from my mistake as my first time here was my last .
american	my wife had to find the waitress ( who was playing on her phone ) to let her know we wanted dessert . i joked that our ice cream was going to come out melted because the waitress would never check on the food ... yes the ice cream came out melted . if you have all day to wait , this is your place . if not , look elsewhere .
american	i 've experienced better . i will be reviewing the veggie burger costing about $ 6 . good chunk of food . big enough to fill out our stomach even if you skipped morning breakfast . but it was not as tasty . the soy patty was plain tasteless and the whole wheat bread doesn 't fit a big burger . it could use more lettuce and less salt .
american	just cause you can make them doesn 't mean you should . the ipa tastes like mildly sweet water , fish and chips were mediocre . the best item i had was the tap water with ice . yummy . please do not ruin the three little beautiful letters , ipa by labeling your beer with them . i 'll bypass this place next time and go to cinnabon .
american	mind you i have not been in years . the menu definitely has changed . what used to be my favorite broccoli cheddar soup that would come in a ginormous bowl sprinkled with cheese and had a side of endless butter crackers it came out in a disappointingly small little cup and was not as special as it once was . it tastes as if it was microwaved . my steak was extremely chewy and over seasoned . our service was also subpar for not being busy on a weeknight . the soup ended up coming out with my meal , because it was forgotten about . it might be my first and last time at this location .
american	i tried to brush the onions off with a napkin and somehow got ketchup from the onions on my hand . ewwww ... i immediately left , out of disgust and went to bw3s with my girlfriend . this is the second time in a short period that i have noticed things that could be cleaned . the other time was ketchup all over the menu . i mean all over the menu . i think the managent there doesn 't focus on cleaning like they should . john taffer should inspect that place . it 's a shame because we love go there but it 's a a huge turn off when they can 't keep it simple clean .
american	it 's been there forever . nice ! tip : please don 't expect much from the waitstaff - they are not happy you are there taking their food and wasting their time . i only get the salad bar so as to not unreasonably bother the clearly pre-pissed off staff . i get it to go despite the warm and inviting atmosphere . yep , it 's special . and no , management , i 'm not going to email my review anywhere else . feel free to cut and paste . or better yet , work on your customer service .
american	how can you messing items as simple as eggs over medium , potato bites and eggs benny ? the food was gross , and my stomach concurred for the next hour after i left . even the salad tasted like potpourri . astonishing lack of adequate ambience ; it looks somewhat decrepit and dirty . look for something else .
american	waiting for brunch it took a long time to get coffee and it arrived lukewarm ! ! ! ! always understaffed ! ! !
american	the menu is pretty dang awesome , lots of salads , burgers , appetizers , nachos . but cheap bar food is apparently cheap bar food universally it seems . we were not expecting fine quality food here but our food came out cold , soggy , and took an exceptionally long time to be served . the service was terrible . after quite a long wait , i asked the waitress what happened to our food service as we saw others who arrived after us with their food . has potential to be a decent cheap spot for some drinks and bar food but i would not recommend .
american	disappointing . what was good = quick service , friendly staff . what was not so good = bland frozen fish , mediocre fries . save your hard earned money and go somewhere else .
american	a strange place this , like it was america back in 50 's but i was hungry and visiting in a new town.the joint was empty bar one but the server was sweet and generous.i scoured the menu for something that wouldn 't kill me and settled on the blt with a side of sweet potato fries.the bread choice was brown or white .. that was it.i nearly pissed myself laughing.the filling of my sandwich tasted okay but the bread tasted like fibreglass.how do these guys stay in business with such out of date food ? i 'll never know because i 'll never be back .
american	kind of empty . too expensive for coffee . omelet was so-so . watermelon was bad / sour . you can do better . ( don 't like the name . )
american	i was extremely disappointed by the menu selection also . as a vegetarian there were no options for breakfast sandwiches . the only choice i had was to buy the more expensive sandwich and specify no meat but still pay the inflated price . i won 't be back unless major changes are made .
american	with $ 24 entrees you would think they would serve their condiments in something other than plastic cups . mundane waitresses with poor attitudes and a pork chop that tasted like fish . way overpriced for the type of atmosphere .
american	i wish i could give it some negative stars . the worst thing is that i 've been to at least four other burger king 's and have had the same problem with the ketchup , but i guess that 's not as bad as the time when they ran outta buns ! ! you run a burger joint ; how are you going to run out of the two essential things to run a burger joint ? ! plus the bun is always two sizes too big for the patty . just have sloppy made burgers . worst chain ever ! ! ! !
american	and this time was another " miss . " waaayyy too peppery ! also as usual , the side dishes for one of the guests in my party didn 't come out until after three requests for them ... and probably 15 minutes after chicken & waffles came out . the waffles were underdone . finally , as usual , the service was spotty .
american	we have been here @ 10 times over past 2 yrs , the food is always fabulous but wait staff is horrific . service is slow , an attitude like it is the end of the world to be serving you and in correct bills . i once emailed manager and never rcvd even an acknowledgement , guess they don 't care either . and for what 's it worth , my wife and i are not complainers . everyone has a bad we get it but now it has become a joke of what type of terrible service will we have this time . to bad because again the food as always been good .
american	i had the new advertised rueben and sure wasn 't impressed .
american	we almost drove off thinking a & w was closed but we saw three customers inside by the register and decided to try . the door opened . it was about 9 pm . the lady behind the counter actually told us they close at 11 . i don 't know why only half the lights are open . it looked closed from the outside . we tried the mama and the papa burger . the only difference is there is an extra patty on the papa burger . there was no fixings on the burger except for a little bit of onion and a couple of pickles . i found it bland . i 'll skip it next time
american	i ordered the shrimp & grits , it was just ok & came lukewarm . shrimp were very small & dry . really could have been served with decent sized juicy shrimps for the price . others ordered the crab salad - nothing really special . we all found the chairs very uncomfortable especially since we got together to gab a bit . it 's definitely not a place to go if you want a leisurely lunch and enjoy your friends company . service wasn 't that great either . not sure i would go back . disappointed in anthem
american	spirits lifted we raced inside for the sidewalk advertised breakfast glories ... sat down ... and were told brunch was only on sundays . my lil heart fell . regroup . i ordered the half sandwich and chili and my partner in this mess ordered a chop salad . the chili should be renamed alpo & cheddar . the salads are better at get go . and direct quote upon our server checking on us .. drumroll .... " from what i see i presume you are okay " and a quick exit stage left . we shall not be returning . even as tempting as the $ 10 sangria made of pure canned fruit juice appears .
american	and i am not exaggerating ! i made a comment to our waitress that i was offended and that i could not believe that his boss would let him walk around in a place of business like that ! the waitress said yes we have told him many times and walked away ! she proceeded to tell him and the manager on duty ! i didn 't get his name or the managers wish i would of then i would filed a formal complaint to corporate ! because when she told both of them they proceeding to give us dirty looks and stare us down ! now mind you i had my children with me ! we actually felt threatened needless to say we will never return !
american	after five minutes i finally got to order . i 'm a simple girl and i only like ketchup mustard and cheese on my burger . of course there is pickles and no ketchup so i had to go back tell them and wait another five minutes for a burger . my s.o. had to wait so we can eat together and his burger bun was completely stale ... gross . maybe there is some new staff but it 's kind of annoying when they ask you the same thing five times .
american	however , out waiter was extremely rude and condescending . he seemed to help everyone else around us but our table . the food was ok . my friend ordered the lobster bisque and there was no trace of lobster . it tasted like creamy tomato basil . if you order shrimp or chicken to a dish expect to pay $ 6.00- $ 8.00 extra . i recommend trying another restaurant in this mall ! !
american	we 've visited this place on several occasions and each time we have the same experience . tonight we waited 30 min for our check . that is 30 min from when plates were cleared . this was not a very busy time this evening and we still left a tip but a tip was not earned . had to ask for silverware had . have to always ask for refills . the food is ok but nothing speciak , it 's breakfast for crying out loud . the place is freezing , the seats are not comfortable and the table and floor were dirty
american	mother finally came by placed the rings in said again and we told one of the workers and replied with : you just came in to tell us that ? i told them i came in to dine in but after seeing that i will not . she replied with well sorry it 's not like i can go throw away all the salad . disgusting ! very bad customer service and who knows what other food is dirty on the buffet ! never again !
american	i start taking a look at the menu and seeing the price hike is a pretty big hike from what i remember . no thank you i don 't want to pay for the facelift ! our server or lack there of was more interested in the other party seated after us so i took that as my cue to leave ! peace out old spaghetti factory i will not pay your prices it 's not that good ! !
american	please see photos for details ... canned / frozen veggies instead of fresh .... others after us received fressh veggies although they said they had none . served mashed potatoes instead of baked and as they were repairing pur plates the steaks aling with friends veggies became cold . bug crawled across table and i caught it in my napkin ... didn 't seem to phase waitress ! friend ordered fresh strawberry cake that didn 't have one slice of strawberries ! that was it ! no manager on duty . spoke with manager on phone ... no help . excuses
american	when you call yourself a burger place you should first have good burgers . the patties seemed to be premade , probably frozen , they were identical . i asked for mine med well the other requested med rare , the were both cook well done . i ordered mine topped with an egg which are normally served over easy or sunny side up so that the yolk runs over the burger . the egg on mine was cooked over hard , the yolk was just a firm lump . the french fries were limp and soggy . i 'd suggest that if you eat here , try something other than a burger ...
american	out of chicken , it 's what the company in based on . and what 's the point of the convenient drive-through when it takes so long . either cancel the drive-through method altogether and have only customers come in for takeout and dine in or do the drive through the right way for people on the go . i 'm not sure if all of the locations for swiss chalet are like this but the wycroft location in brutal . hopefully this location will improve their drive-through methods and have chicken ready ! ! !
american	i don 't like their breakfast items , so i will probably not return here .
american	every single time i go to this mcdonald 's , they are slow , rude , and above all do not care one bit . the drive through is always 20 min or more wait time , the inside is not great either . i try to actively avoid this mcdonald 's now . something needs to change there .
american	i 've experienced better . " the food is totally fine , although only one thing stood out to me , and that was the foie gras snickers dessert thing . the service was basically fine too , certainly nothing special . basically , nothing made sage special . and also , the fact that the place was barely occupied at 9 pm on a friday was just straight depressing . they need to work on their marketing and get some people to make this place have more wow factor . overall , for the money in vegas , you can certainly do better .
american	the drinks are great , the outside deck is great , and they are always crowded with folks , but it is not for the food ! the buffalo shrimp for a snack very tasty , but the steaks , the steak sandwiches , and the burgers are not . one exception--the ribs are not bad and edible ! go , have a drink , eat a snack , for that it 's all good !
american	that 's all you can really say . some say if you are looking for gourmet- not service , go here . seriously ? ! if i 'm spending the money on a roasted chicken , i should get served in an appropriate amount of time . i shouldn 't have to wave down a " water boy " for a refill of water . i shouldn 't have to flag down a server just for my check ( our dinner plates were taken away 30 minutes prior- no one asked if we wanted dessert ) . the food ? yes , it 's good . the service will keep me from going back . i can get better service at denny 's ...
american	the appetizers and main dishes were tasty and correctly proportioned for a pleasant experience that didn 't overwhelm . it was very unfortunate that our dessert ( a mousse with a sponge base ) had picked up some mold ( yes - blue mold on the base ) . we alerted the kitchen to this fact only to be told that it was not mold but chocolate powder and flour . i don 't know why they felt the need to deny the extremely characteristic smell / taste / color - perhaps they were afraid of a health inspection . at least they comp 'ed the dessert . we left insulted and disappointed for that single unfortunate event .
american	walking down the stairwell was fun ! ( minus the heat-felt like youre walking into an oven ) the server was awesome . she knew her job well . she does crack your crab legs for you- that was cool . other than that , the food quality was poor . this was extremely overpriced for the quality ! we were in a party of six and all of us had to agree we were all upset about the blan food . im not a huge salt fan- i had to put salt on my food about 4 times to give it flavor . i do not think an expensive menu makes for good food .
american	then you see the special board which read " good food takes time " and there is a clock next to that . fine that 's cool but the problem is that after waiting for our " good food " it came out and was awful . my wife said she has tasted better pancakes out of the freezer section at the grocery store . $ 30 later we boxed up the food only to throw it away . the good news is that we went around the corner to the breakfast club and had an excellent meal .
american	sadly after waiting three times the length the host said it would take we were escorted to sub par dining room . service was lacking , waiter was brief and short on manors . we ordered a number of different courses and found them to be middle of the road in flavor and taste . the salads were tasty as a perk . portions were large and drinks were good as a plus .. on the way out you get yummy mints .
american	for 11 , 12 bucks you get a tasty , but puny little burger and no fries ! needless to say , not the best place to go if you 're hungry and on a budget .
american	all i tasted was a mouthful of mince meat and onions . i 've tried the frozen white castle burgers back in college , and i think those were more memorable . skip this place , and save your belly for tastier vegas eats .
american	struggled to fill my plate up once with something appetizing , seriously one of the worst , cheapest looking spreads i 've seen , dennys is better , not kidding .
american	it is just a step above a motel 6 like hotel . the hotel in many areas is basically falling apart .
american	don 't spoil a great day by eating microwave fast food . the spinach dip was disgusting . the burger was much worst than a microwave frozen burger . the chicken sandwich was cold and the fish and chip were so gross i was speechless . oh ! and i almost forgot ... this was by far the worst service i 've ever experienced in toronto
american	as we are waiting for a refill at the salad bar , the person working there takes out a bag of salad opens it and brown goo oozes out . she continues to pick out the rotten leaves and uses the rest . no salad for us . the bbq was awful bar the mashed potatoes . the chines was cooked to rubber , the pizza looked good , but tasted like cardboard . not sure how they managed to make it so bad . given this , i dared not try the sushi . the beverages where of course self serve . the chocolate ice cream was ok . the staff was polite , but uninspired . total waist of money .
american	party of 5 and had to wait 20 minutes to be seated . food was bland and cold . sausages taste like spam , sushi was packaged as sold in store , and chicken waffles had no chicken inside ( we tried a few ) . we will never come here again !
american	don 't waste your time or money . food was good - not great . service was sloooooooooooooooooow . the " chefs " circled our table like buzzards- the waitress was no where to be seen- until she popped over and with perky grin - your order is next ( 4 : 45 ) wondered if we could sneek out- but there were only 4 other peopled tables . ( came in after us ) i had urban chicken - ehhh okay- lame tex mex offering - he had tortellini and chicken ( that is it ! -no breadstick no salad no crouton or even parsley ) and some chef boyardee sauce . don 't go - hold out until 5 for boca !
american	one of our dishes had literally spoiled , smelled like a barnyard floor , and had to be sent back . the chef admitted it had gone bad . nothing we ordered attained a rarefied level of culinary excellence or elegance . the service was excellent , and i 'm sure fancy people are going to continue spending piles of money here , but for this kind of money i won 't be giving them a second chance . ultimately uninspired .
american	service is terrible . bartender doesn 't understand the term " another round . " so we move to the tables .. the server would rather text and roll silverware than even acknowledge your existence . party of 5 ... we left .
american	when i got there to pick up or to go order i was told it would be a few minutes because the cheese was being melted onto the burgers . i ended up waiting a good 10 minutes and then when i got our order home every item in the app sampler was grossly undercooked . the breaking was just sliding off as soon as you picked any item up and there were pools of water making everything soggy . yes , water not grease . i regret spending the $ 50 here and should have just taken my family through the drive through at wendy 's right next store .
american	after 2 attempts to have salmon cooked properly i gave up . the portion sizes have been reduced drastically adding to the disappointment from a prior above average chain . the ladies rest room was a mess , i could go on but you get the idea just go to , delallos for a fab dinner
american	... out of prime rib . .. no prime rib french dip . . .out if the chicken sandwich . . out of the specials . . . service slow . . .explained our disappointment and got fake apologies . really disappounting .
american	i order medium fries . 9 : 28 i 'm at the window waiting . 9 : 33 still no fries . i left . no excuses for such poor service .
american	once we got to our table we sat at our table we were told our server would be right with us . 5-minutes in sitting time a different server with a giant flower in her hair said our server would be right with us . 10-minutes in that same server gave us some water . 15- minutes in we walked out . i don 't understand how this happened . we were looking forward to a delicious meal and received nothing but disappointment .
american	service was slow at best . soup was asked for before the burger and it came with the burger and had at best 2 tablespoons of soup in the bowl . wings were order off of the menu and later they told us they ran out of them . it 's 7 on a friday how can this be . salad was ordered with a burger never delivered . they have plenty of staff standing around and they seem clueless . i 've been coming here on and off since it opened a few years ago . never again . spend your lonely else where . if i could give it a zero star i would have .
american	taking over an hour to eat at a lunch time place is a no go . offering to refill two people 's diet pepsi and then switching the glasses is something we avoided on this particular trip , but has happened in the past . really only go here if you aren 't on a schedule and don 't mind fairly mediocre food .
american	so two stars for that . had a foot long with fries . dog was ok but bun was fully split into two pieces which mad handling an issue . the fries were well under done . sadness . this place could be a 3 but care and attention to detail was really lacking . they were not even that busy . the good all beef dogs the bad fully split bun . under done fries . servers just going through the motions . the ugly 20 bucks for a dog and fries .
american	yes , the price is reasonable but the food is pathetically mediocre . go across the street and eat at the market street cafe at the california hotel , and save your money to splurge on a really good buffet elsewhere in vegas . the glowing 4 and 5 star reviews here , make zero sense .
american	this place lacked the good food . my husband had a dirty knife , lipstick on his coffee cup ( really wasn 't his shade ) , and cold fries . my grilled cod fish tacos were lukewarm at best . we sat in the patio and the floor was sticky and had trash on it . server took off $ 5 for the trouble . manager checked before we left and we told him all of the above . he gave us a $ 25 voucher to come back . if you love beer , than this will be a 5-star place to come . however , we won 't be back .
american	my friend is on his third ribeye and mine was the worst cut of meat i have ever had at a restaurant . my jaws are sore from chewing the gristle . wine is great and sides are great . but the steak is awful and was cooked poorly - lots of char . was great four years ago but has gone downhill . cutting a lot of corners now .
american	it was a delicious burger and fries but my wife and i spent later that night and the next day in the bathroom . my kids had the hotdog and they didn 't get it . awesome way to spend a six hour drive home .
american	i 'm not sure of the hype but i was disappointed ! ! walking into the place , it seemed promising . it was packed ; we had to share a table with another family . the staff was very accommodating and the menu was loaded with bbq delights however the food was lacking . i ordered the brisket beef hotdog and the wife had the bbq chicken sandwich . both lacked favor and were over priced ( imo ) . i wouldn 't go back .
american	duck tasted as if had been drenched in soy , horribly salty and far over cooked . scallop risotto was a bland mush concoction with diced pieces of scallops . the person served this ate about 10 % of the plate . crab cakes were thought ok . appetizers were a bit better . cheesecake was shared by 4 people and 2 / 3 wasn 't eaten . service was nice and prices were reasonable . overall no one in our party enjoyed the place and can 't recommend it .
american	i show up at 2 : 03 and the host jokingly says we are closed . we laughed . but he meant it . last year my burger ordered medium came out almost raw . i am never going back
american	there were many different choices , from italian to mexican to japanese to chinese . some were edible and some were not . the only thing i really liked was the grilled asparagus . the dessert bar was a disaster which reminded me of a slightly better version of the hometown buffet . one would expect a better buffet at the mirage . what the hell happened ? the price is reasonable though at about $ 20 . if you are just going to 1 buffet , this should not be the one .
american	ate a burger last night , and got sick with headache , diarrahea , and the chills. will not go back .
american	the barbecue sause was flavorless. also the price was more than it should be
american	chose this restuarant because we ( me & wife ) were visiting las vegas with our 8-year-old daughter , who is a picky eater . the service was efficient , the ambiance is casino loud , and the food is pretty good . i ordered a basic hamburger with cheese and bacon and it was good , but definitely not worth the price i paid ( $ 14 ) . the fact that you have to pay extra for fries adds insult to injury . i cannot recommend this place because the value is horrible .
american	the first time , the burger was amazing . the second time around , just now , i got home and my burger tasted like laundry detergent . had my boyfriend check to make sure it isn 't just my imagination . he smelled it as well . disappointed !
american	i am still bitter as i am a loyal fan of gr . as far as the restaurant goes i thought the female staff were dressed quite tacky even for vegas .. if i wanted boobs / ass / gine in my face i would have gone to a gentlemen 's club . when hot food was brought to the table it tasted good , but terrible service and good food can 't balance each other out .
american	we had 2 salads and a child 's order of pasta . we waited for well over 20 + min . on top of this , i had to ask our waitress 3 ( three ) times for juice and more dressing . needs improving .
american	ridiculous i will never patronize again . also the food is just ok not the greatest they should b glad u stop in with all the other choices .
american	i have been to cravings before , but this time was a bitter disappointment . you go through the normal buffet queue to arrive at your table and i found that everything had changed since my last visit . they had waiters / waitresses serving tables , but they have basically been reduced to bus persons . you have to fetch your own coffee , orange juice or alcoholic beverages . the food was generally acceptable , but no where near where you 'd go out of your way to eat there . mirage used to have an outstanding buffet , but i would only eat there now if i was staying at the mirage and frankly you 'd be better off going to bellagio .
american	had a discount voucher purchased from living social . after 10 minutes waiting for them to try to figure out how to deal with it i was told for some reason they would not honor the voucher , which is still being sold on the living social website . i easily got a refund but if you want to attract business like this it would help if your employees knew what they were doing !
american	had to ask to get my after filled that 's after five minutes of my empty glass sitting at the edge of the bar lastly it was 810 pm not prime time and two bartenders
american	good thing it was free because we were very underwhelmed . the selection seemed small for a friday lunch . the sushi selection was just a few rolls , the rice was also hard so i got the feeling it had been out for a ling time . the prime rib and cheese blintz were really all i ate and found enjoy able . pretty sad for a buffet and someone who loves food . given free passes again i 'd more then likely pass . if you are looking for a good vegas buffet i do recommend the wynn .
american	dry , over cooked and cold . chips were cold . it looked great , the smell was awesome , the line was long for an expensive , bad food choice . the restaurant must be better but this was terrible . the chicken sandwich that my daughter had was great though . they grabbed our food from a line of pre-staged orders and that was the problem . eat before you arrive at the game .
american	they were so focused on taking care of the drive through that it took them 30 minutes to prepare our simple order to eat in their dining room . when we finally received the sandwiches they tasted like they were made 30 minutes earlier and left under a heat lamp . they were a little above room temperature . the fries were hot but over cooked . we asked for our money back and left .
american	29.99 per person , four of us . buffet was out of meats , pasta , and several main dishes . seafood enchiladas had no seafood , just an empty tortilla in sauce . i 've never seen a buffet in vegas out of food . people were standing and waiting on food . we asked for refills several times and no one ever came back . very poor service and poorly planned .
american	the menu is boring , and doesn 't have anything interesting on it . our food was ok , but we ordered the special - chicken nachos . they were pretty standard nachos , but nothing to complain about there . also , the women 's restroom wasn 't too great ; one ' out of order ' stall , and the other didn 't ' have a lock . my advice is to keep walking past this place , unless it 's the only open place .
american	my wife had a really nice salad . i ordered the fried oysters ( good ) and the asian bbq salmon ( sauce hid the taste of salmon completely . service was very good . atmosphere was dark . overall overpriced .
american	ordered " eggs your way , " scrambled eggs , toast , hash browns & bacon . everything dripping with oil / grease , hash browns mushy , bacon swimming in grease not drained , eggs tough , orange juice watered down , even toast spread with too much fake butter . i have eaten here before with better results . whatever fake butter / oil , grease they use , need to change to a more common healthy version and not use so much . i understand there is a new owner , he should send in undercover to check out the food . this was a holiday and lots of people should be stopping by , expected better service and food .
american	breakfast was okay . nothing to write home about . ate the egg white mushroom and spinach omelet . a little greasy but okay . glad they had a healthy option . also came with fruit . again , not terrible . it was just okay . service sucked . waiter was nice but clearly did not give a crap about being there . you could tell she was more interested in gossiping even though i mentioned ( more than once ) i had to leave at 11 : 15am and needed to get out of there .
american	i really expected more . the service was terrible . the egg white sandwich on a pretzel roll sounded great , but it was very poor . there was absolutely no care in the assembly of the sandwich and the " hash browns " were just a deep fried triangle potato patty . unfortunately it 's the airport , and when you give a long term exclusive contract to one operator , there is no concern for quality .
american	it wasn 't very good and pretty overpriced to be honest . i should have walked on down to subway . one night we tried to get some breakfast because we saw they started serving breakfast at 2 : 00am . we were disappointed to find they weren 't serving at 3 : 15am . they had closed for cleaning and then were kind of rude to us about how they weren 't open . well when i finally got breakfast i was looking forward to the " breakfast potatoes . " well they turned out to be tater tots ! blah . i would stick to lunch at this place .
american	not bad , just not very remarkable in terms of uniqueness or flavour of food . cozy atmosphere , but again nothing really to set it apart from any other cafe .
american	we were seated fairly quickly , but then it took forever for our waitress to come take our order . i ordered the 2 egg breakfast and my husband ordered a breakfast burrito . the couple next to us had to call the waitress over just to place their order . they didn 't seem that busy and it still took at least 20 minutes for our food to come out . the eggs were watery , my toast was cold , and their hash browns weren 't hash browns , but deep fried potato rounds . my husband said the breakfast burrito was the worst he 's over had . $ 40 for nasty breakfast food just isn 't worth it to me !
american	breakfast in a bar , surrounded by tv screens . at breakfast , really ? hash browns tasted of old grease , egg benedict - definitely not hollandaise sauce . my companion 's eggs were cold and runny . sorry - we should have known we were in the wrong place when we walked in . second star is for service - that was good .
american	the food was less than acceptable . eggs were really overcooked . ham was overcooked and really tough . even the bacon wasn 't right . i mean , how can someone mess up bacon ? coffee was barely warm in the pot they bring you out . the only reason i 'm giving two stars is because despite the quality of the food , the servers were doing the best they could . and they were friendly . i realize that it was mothers day and they were busy , but it 's a restaurant . there 's no excuse for the food to be bad regardless of how busy they get .
american	) the food was not bad at all . the service was abominable ! worst i have had in some time . after being seated , we waited at least 15 minutes before we were offered coffee . without a lot of work we would never have been served at all . most of the time it seemed like there were no servers in a larger room at all . understaffed and poorly trained . i would never ever go back . the aggravation is not worth it !
american	service is b team and consists of someone saying they are sorry for dirty plates , tough pancakes and a long wait . wont be back , they need a manager and some real waitstaff , along with a short order cook .
american	this is my third time here for a late breakfast . food was just your basic eggs and toast , the service was not so hot . been there twice before and had a great blond and brunette duo . guess they have made some changes and it sure made a difference . no smiling faces , no interest in having a conversation . just straight diner . if your looking for friendliness the staff has changed . sorry rambos , should have kept the old staff ...
american	did not meet my expectations at all . every dish was soaked in oil and the eggs i asked for to be cooked through came completely runny . the server never came by to ask how everything was and at the end when we finally tracked another server down for the bill and ours brought it over she did not ask why my meal was untouched . seems obvious i was unsatisfied since my meal was untouched but she didn 't seem to care at all . will not be returning .
american	i don 't believe it was beef . absolutely a different taste and not good . i have had good burgers but i am thinking possibly a different kind of meat ? awful . never going back !
american	if you want the most expensive tiny little hot dog you every ate , go here . if you want cheese fries , make sure you don 't need a fork because they don 't appear to stock forks . if you want heartburn , go here . if you want really mediocre overpriced food , this is for you . on a positive note , the fries were hot . almost $ 22 for 3 dogs , 1 french fry , 1 soda .
american	i 'm a native charlottean and have had many types of bbq and this is not a good carolina-style bbq . the sauce was terrible and the pork had an odd flavor . the bbq half chicken was good , but the pulled pork was terrible . the banana pudding was incredible though .
american	the salad was good , but ribeye had way too much fat and little taste . you are much better off for the same money at delmonicos . overall , not impressive , won 't be back .
american	i ordered the bobbie and it was ice cold . i saw another yepler mentioned that , so i was prepared to nuke it . but why would they serve it like that ? they should offer to heat it for you upon request . my husband took a bite of my sandwich , and pulled a bendable piece of plastic out of his mouth ! he got the castrami and said it was just meh . too bad , we were looking for a new sandwich spot .
american	ordered the bison cheesesteak , ate 3 / 4 of it , and found the most disgusting black curly piece of hair imbedded in my meat . couldn 't submit my review until now since it still makes me want to vomit just writing about it .
american	not sure why they have omelette in the name ? the omelette i had was overcooked and rubbery . it was as though they pre-made them and tried to microwave them before serving ( you know , when it 's so hot in the middle of the omelette ? you can 't help but suspect microwaving ) . no . stop now . turn around , go hit mcdonalds if you have to - just don 't go here ! edit 7 / 15 / 16 : this place is no longer in business ( gee wonder why ? ) .
american	the food was decent but the service is ridiculously slow ... our last time trying this place , we waited almost 1.5 hours for 3 burgers ( it was about 3 am ) . other tables who sat after us were receiving their orders before we did . we made it well known to the server that we were not happy . the manager did end up coming over and comping our whole meal . even with good management , i can 't recommend a place that serves this slow consistently .
american	there was nothing memorable from the pasta , chicken , or the salad i had tried . nothing was " bad , " but nothing to write home about , that 's for sure .
american	had an omelet that had way too much green pepper and mushroom and not nearly enough cheese and onions . and on top of that the whole thing tasted like old olive oil . toast seemed to have never been buttered . the potatoes were ok as was the coffee , but after making an effort to come here as a treat , we were severely disappointed .
american	too many people walking past our table , everyone was standing up and loud , so distracting , almost like the tables needed to be separated farther apart . the food was nice though , but nothing i had stood out as memorable
american	went there 2 weeks ago and it was horrible. i got the ribeye steak dinner and my fiancee got the ribeye steak sandwich , they were super thin , no seasoning not even salt and pepper , the steak was super tough and was reminiscent of those frozen steaks in a box the one could get at walmart . not sure what happened to this restaurant but it has seriously gone down hill .
american	the owner are filipino 's and may have never been to philly . .. lol and they sell philly cheese steak . according to the owner , they have been here for the last 15 years and the hotel will be turned into a parking lot by august . the owner and his wife was super nice , however , the philly cheese steak had no flavor . i 'm sad to see them shut down , but i 'm sure being here for 15 years they did something good . i wish them luck . but don 't come here if your expecting a real philly cheesesteak .
american	have to admit i 'm not a big outback fan but i had a gift card so we went . the service was pretty good . we were seated quickly and the waiter was friendly . i ordered the large prime rib . it was not very good . it didn 't seem to have any kind of rub on it for flavor . it had a fair amount of fat on it that wasn 't good . if it has good flavor i don 't mind a little extra fat . not a good meal for what it cost
american	i should have known when i saw the huge vat of precooked philly cheesesteak meat he pulled out from under the counter ... but i was there at the recommendation of a friend so i tried it out . never again !
american	last meal before extreme stomach pains . it 's now 11 : 30pm and still in pain . buffet in ceasars waaaaaay better . this one was kind of gross and it got me sick . booo .
american	by far worst food i 've ever ate , restaurant was dirty , food was hot only reason for one star would give negative stars if i could , the waitress spilled water all over out table as she was taking stuff from table then looked back blamed our table like we did it . fries we 're good . nothing else had shits for a week after . wash your hands in kitchen .
american	no crowd , sat right down . service was good , but the food was not . eggs and bacon were obviously being cooked in large batches , then just plated as necessary . all of our scrambled eggs came out cold , and the bacon was pink and rubbery . after sending it back , the manager returned with made to order eggs and some of the same pink , rubbery bacon that had been heated up . ridiculous that they can 't get breakfast right on a sunday morning when the place is half empty .
american	if there was butter on the burger i would not have known .
american	wondering if this restaurant wasnt a michael symon restaurant , if it would have half the good reviews it has . not impressed with the flavor or quality of the food and the service . not rushing back . very pricey for a tiny burger .
american	i had the lobster bisque out on the terrace with my friend , and i must say it was the worst i have experienced . it tasted like a pudding ( very sweet ) , with a dash of chili powder , and minute slivers of lobster . the price should have commanded a great lobster bisque . it prevented me from ever considering dinner there , even though the view is as beautiful as any place i know in phoenix . sorry about the delay in writing a review , but due too many bad food experiences with sizeable price tags , i have decided to speak the truth about food . if we all say nothing , bad becomes the order of the day .
american	not sure why so many stars . gave 2 stars instead of 1 because the chicken itself was tender and cooked well . the batter had no flavor , or only and oily flavor . very bland . the dipping sauce none of us liked . cole slaw was average . probably won 't try again . ps kids enjoy ranch on their strips , they don 't carry ranch .
american	i ordered a caesar salad which was flavorless and had barely any dressing . i would not get it again . i had the thin crust veggie pizza which i liked a lot and almost ate the entire thing . my husband had a pepperoni , but did not like it . he said the sauce was not good and did not go want there again . so even though with the restaurant.com deal making this meal almost free ( paid like 14 dollars total ) , we won 't be going back there any time soon most likely .
american	we should have taken a cab somewhere else . the cost is ridiculous for the food that you get . i would have appreciated hometown buffet more as far as taste , quality of food and price goes .
american	barely worth that much . food was all bland and the hot food was generally cold . there was a pretty good selection of food , drinks and desserts along with a friendly staff . that along with the desserts being pretty good raised my one star to two . if you get a deal on the cost and are looking for quantity over quality , this might be an option for you . however , with as many places to eat in vegas , i recommend finding a better spot .
american	this is my first time eating at this chain . i was not impressed . freschetta frozen pizza tasted better than this place . the prices were ridiculous . for the same price i would rather go to settebello 's . they are the best pizza in town ! save your money and forgo california pizza kitchen .
american	what a disappointment ! ! i ordered a regular coney with sauerkraut and onions and a side of fries and my husband ordered a calzone . all of the food was lukewarm , the sausage was like rubber and the fries were limp . the calzone was full of tomato paste and minimal pepperoni . we won 't be coming back here !
american	they butchered the lobster , scallops and shrimp . they were over cooked and peppered to the point the food was inedible . i would have been better off going to red lobster for a fraction of the cost or made it at home . definitely could have done a much better job . the other person in my party had the rib eye which was flavorless ! ! ! the service was good . so disappointed !
american	food was poorly heated and the sliced roast definitely looked better at the buffet , then when it was sitting on my plate , turning my stomach with it 's uneven cooking . i don 't know what happened to these guys since years ago they actuallyed seemed to know what they were doing , but we vowed it would be our last time to eat here . expensive too as buffets go ( even during a thanksgiving night ) .
american	my boyfriend and i sat in the bar . the bartender was extremely rude right off the bat . service was horrible . i had to wait a long time for my bottomless mimosas every time i wanted a refill . i also ordered a burger and not only was it really small but it tasted pretty average . nothing special about this place . overpriced and not worth the time .
american	1-placed smelled like dishwater or a musty clothes hamper . 2- waitress obviously hated here job and when a friend asked a question about a cut of steak she was told " i don 't eat meat , so , i think that one is better " 3- got the ribeye sandwich and the meat was cut so thin i thought it was a very inexpensive deli sandwich 4- even the beer had a funky taste 5- water glasses had that musty taste as well . try bonefish next door or melts down the road . i wouldn 't eat here again for nothing . not good at all .
american	they aren 't equipped to handle any crowds . the hostess kept running around and asking people what their pager numbers - why ? i have no clue . our table was dirty upon being seated . it took awhile to be waited on . the hostess cleaned a table and then put the towel on the floor then picked it up later to use again . another hostess kept wiping his nose with his hands and shirt . disgusting .
american	i 've had better breakfast at denny 's . my eggs were way over cooked and the pancakes were like cold cardboard . i had to send them back . the waitress was very nice and embarrassed about the food . too boot , the restaurant was full of these tiny little gnat type bugs that were flying everywhere . even after being asked to move away from the window they were still buzzing our heads.will not eat here again
american	the service was terrible . we only waited a few minutes to be seated , but getting someone to come and take our order took almost twenty minutes . water refills took forever as well . when the restaurant is full of empty tables this shouldn 't happen ! the food was standard breakfast fare , and the quality was decent . however , with two entrees and coffees , the tab was over $ 50 . i expected as much for vegas , but if i 'm paying that much for food i could get anywhere , it would be nice if the service was top-notch .
american	typical diner food . my omelette was pretty good but the hash browns were awful ! there was so much butter flavoring in them they were soggy . wouldn 't come here again .
american	had a cappuccino and the lox benedict . the $ 6 cappuccino was okay - could have been stronger . the benedict was basically okay . one egg was overcooked ( solid yolk when cut ) but the real disappointment was that the dish was cold . i was there at 7 : 30 and they were not crowded at all . no excuse for a sub-standard meal . especially at $ 30 .
american	dinner : buffet was available , but opted to order off the menu . ordered the club sandwich and it was ok . the chicken / turkey was very salty and i expect it was pre-frozen food that was defrosted . drinks : poor beer selection , but that seems to be typical of many hotel bars . mixed drinks were fine . breakfast : buffet was included in my hotel stay . decent spread , but nothing jumped out as amazing .
american	the sandwich was bland , but the sauce they use is pretty good . everything else in the sandwich didn 't have much flavor in my opinion . the fries were pretty good though ! the service was good , and they got out order right ! wait time before we got our food was about 10-15 minutes , which was fine considering it was about 12 : 30 pm on a saturday . will probably not eat here again .
american	took about 45 min to get our food once we ordered and it wasn 't even busy . also not good for small kids since they do not have high chairs available .
american	italian beef was dry , aus jus had no flavor , the hot dog was drenched in mustard to the point it was oozing through the bun . the fries were good .
american	very average at best . don 't think you are getting real southern comfort food . my poboy was served on a hot dog bun . catfish bites was more fried breading than catfish . coleslaw and hush puppies were best part of the meal . find a better option .
american	i had high expectations due to the reviews but i must say , the food was mediocre and the service the same . turkey sausage was disgusting my buddies brkfst burrito was dry . will not return . it 's over rated and over priced . save yourself the time and money , go to the cracked egg or egg works .
american	had the all you can eat fish and chicken . the fish was okay but nothing special . the chicken was overcooked and very very dry . son had a pasta dish with chicken and he complained about the chicken having a weird taste . service was slow . asked for more fish , ten minutes later i had to remind him . second round of fish was worse than the first . maybe it had been sitting for a while because the server forgot about it .
american	was going to have a turkey sandwich but the turkey looked disgusting ! then opted for the tuna which tasted terrible and ultimately made me sick ! ! ! will never eat there again !
american	i 've heard a lot of good things about this place and figured it was about time i checked it out . first and foremost this is a locals casino . there is a lot that comes along with that . usually kind of run down atmosphere , usually the smell of smoke in the air , and a lot of noise . this place was no different . as far as the food goes , it wasn 't awful . i would compare it to outback only cheaper , or tgif / applebees . it 's not awful , it 's not amazing . i will say that the staff was amazing . a + for the employees .
american	i had the pork benedict with home fries and a side of bacon while my friend got the denver omelette . the pork was dry , i was given the wrong kind of bacon . his omelette was ok but the biscuit on the side was so stale we joked about throwing it against a wall . i really don 't understand how this place has 3.5 stars . giving it 2 because the bloody mary 's were decent minus the entire stalk of celery taking up space where more vodka could be . the home fries were awesome . service was friendly . won 't be going back - not nearly worth a $ 43 breakfast for two .
american	nice atmosphere . food is too salty . even my salad was salty ! shared the half chicken for my entree . it ' s wrapped in a nice pastry and brought out before the chef carves it so you can see the presentation . again way too salty . i eat a limited amount of meat and a lot of the vegetarian options were sold out . disappointed and will not return .
american	we always stay at aria . got the pepperoni & house sausage pizza . we were surprised the crust was chewy after being cooked in a wood-fired oven & the toppings were quite greasy . really a let down for the place & price ! ! !
american	the food is a bit overpriced for what you get and the vegetarian choices are almost none . i got a 4 cheese grilled cheese . it was good but not what i would usually order for dinner . it came with a choice of sides and i got fruit . it was a little over ripe . the mojito i had was yummy though .
american	three people costs 97.00 with tax . we ordered 3 beers and that was an additional $ 14 . the food quality was ok but nothing that i would say separates mgm grand buffet from a circus circus buffet - honestly , you are better off going down the strip to eat not sure if it 's that no one is gambling and they have to raise the prices or if it 's just a matter of them pricing it high because they think they can . staff was nice and the deserts were ok - the rest was sub par , the meat selections were minimal and the seafood selection was a joke
american	attractive place and friendly staff . however the food was disappointing . it was not the " crispy crunchy " chicken described on their website home page . we had the tenders and there was no crunch at all . the seasoning is interesting but not anything i 'd want again . the choices of only tenders wings and thighs was surprising . what about breasts and drumsticks ? when i got back on line i discovered that the nyc location has these plus several other sides not offered here . i feel cheated as maybe it 's better at their nyc location but i won 't come back to this one . as others have said , way too expensive for what you get .
american	beet salad very good . brussel sprouts are excellent . butterscotch dessert fabulous . rib eye filled with strips of fibrous connective tissue too tough to chew ; i had to keep spitting out big gobs of it . rest of rib eye was tough , not tender . salmon was good . overall a big disappointment . i was ready for some great meat and what i got was sizzler . i don 't want to be overly harsh but the rib eye was not good . i wish we 'd eaten somewhere else .
american	both of our lobsters were over cooked , the sides of baked potatos and broccoli were cold . the broccoli was covered with a cheese product that was much too heavy for the vegetable . the baked potato was small and slightly larger than a red potato from the grocery store . parking is inconvenient and had to park at a business next door . very disappointing and i will never be back . i don 't understand the attraction .
american	ordered shrimp and grits . grits were so lumpy i wasn 't sure if they were cold or from earlier in the day . the dish wasn 't seasoned . shrimp and sausage was good . biscuit was the best part of the meal . deviled egg ... either made earlier in the day or day before . i did let the waitress know i wasn 't happy with the meal and she did offer something else . i declined . not sure what all the reave is about . much better food in charlotte for the price .
american	have to say i was disappointed . we were seated right away but dinner took a while to arrive ( 30 min ) , which should not be the case for a restaurant of this style , in my view . food was ok , not super . i had the smoked meat bagel . it was acceptable but wouldn 't seek it out again . experience was ruined by a chain-smoking lard ass on the patio table beside us . waiters didn 't deal with the guy .
american	our server , blake , left something to be desired . he forgot to give us the happy hour menu during happy hour ! ! sort of defeats the purpose . he seemed new , or just disconnected . my main complaint is the horrible pear martinis . my wife had 2 of these and they were as weak as dishwater ! ! ! also , we were charged the full price instead of happy hour price . also , there is no way to contact the restaurant itself on their own website .
american	if you love excessive cheese on your pizza this is a good go to . otherwise the balance of sweet and salty for most is off owing to the overwhelming cheese . service too was also disappointing as the waiter would sprint by asking if we needed anything . the two stars are for the ambiance which is fun and upbeat and loud .
american	while the food we ordered was flavorful , the service was horrible and slooooow . we waited almost an hour for the food to be served . the waiter could not be located and we had to ask the receptionist for drink refills . the manager ( if that was the manager ) just chatted with the receptionist staff and did not go around to check with customers . we were ready to leave when the food came . there are better options out there i bet . avoid this place if you are in a hurry .
american	note to chef .. blackened scallops does not mean you rub the scallops around on the dirty grill to make them black . that 's exactly what these tasted like. no seasoning whatsoever . she liked her perch and the fried shrimp was ok , though over cooked .
american	it wasn 't the best food ever but i did expect better for it being in yorkville and the prices
american	waitress didn 't say anything about the change until i was angry .. that 's just wrong .. food cost change everyday ... bring back the special in which gave you your space in the restaurant world ..
american	worst panera bread i have ever been in anywhere in the usa . large house flies crawling all over the food sitting at the pick up window . dirty tables , floors , and windows , yuk ! ! know one seemed to care or even blinked an eye . i will never come back here again . ill stick to the brunswick and strongsville locations .
american	you can find much better buffets for only a few dollars more .
american	was starved , and the burger joint was in the flamingo where we were staying . expected overpriced food ( it was ) but did not expect the quesadilla i ordered to be pretty much a tortilla with a full block of cheese inside . too greasy really to eat . my bf 's burger however was not too bad ( although pricey ) definitely said i 'd avoid it the rest of the trip , however once friends arrived ended up there another late night for wings ... guess convenience wins in vegas . ( one bonus is getting a discount if you are a total rewards member )
american	the crust was like cardboard , the sauce was just ok , nothing to write home about . the girl behind the counter was nice to us , but i did witness an altercation between her and another customer , he must have said it was cold or something wasn 't right because she ripped the plate out of his hand and forcefully threw it into a trash can behind her and then not so nicely shoved another plate with a slice on it at him . i would not go out of my way to go here again , unless i was so intoxicated that i couldn 't make it to another restaurant and even then , i might just try to go somewhere else anyways .
american	tonight we decided to go back and had high hopes . started off with the calimarie and when it came out , there was almost no sauce with it . the salad was fine but too much dressing . i had the chicken piccatta and it was very oily and the sides were penne pasta with tomato sauce and some steamed carrots and broccoli . my wife had the halibut piccatta special that was very salty . not really worth the money and the atmosphere was a senior citizen crowd .
american	the service was horribly slow . our waiter was obviously over-sat and it took almost 5 minutes to get a damn bottle of tabasco to the table . at one point i asked our server if he had a pair of scissors i could borrow and he informed me that he did not have enough time to look , wtf . the only thing i can say nice about this place was that my omleette was pretty tasty ( spinach and feta cheese ) and the hostess kindly located some scissors for me . if you ask for iced coffee they will tell you they do not have it but will make it for you , once again wtf .
american	the decor is way outdated . the carpet is supposed to be red but is black because it 's so old . the portion sizes are good but all of the food lacked seasoning . i order the country version of eggs benedict , which consists of a biscuit , sausage , poached egg and gravy with a side of country potatoes . i was so disappointed that the white gravy looked and tasted like it came from an instant mix ... definitely not a good quality sausage gravy ... it had no flavor . the country potatoes where crispy but again lacked any seasoning . bottoms line ... will never go back
american	drinks were expensive and small . littlest martini i ever had for $ 10 . food was good except for dessert---very average . star was so much better . place was nearly empty and it still took more than hour and 1 / 4 on a a very limited menu . can 't imagine what would happen on a busy night .
american	menu has changed and does not have quality choices and the food was poor and had very small proportions . very overrated restaurant . looked like it may be a good place to go have a drink though , just as you don 't order the calamari appetizer .... yuck
american	i like that some proceeds are donated to local hunger efforts . but , the service was somewhat lacking . we weren 't checked on after our food arrived . nearby tables were left unbussed . it wasn 't terribly crowded . the food was acceptable , though my companion 's steak was overdone .
american	in no way compares to rodeo drive location . outside of a helpful barkeep and some very fresh mignonette oysters food was disappointing , especially the chewy calamari but also chicken sausage pizza which was underwhelming .
american	super slow service . the brisket was pretty terrible . tasted like minute steak in the microwave . chicken wasn 't bad , pulled turkey was interesting , pulled pork was good , pork ribs were okay and boneless beef shortrib was pretty good . the sides and desserts should be skipped , don 't expect to eat a lot of them when your food comes as they are pretty awful across the board . not nearly good enough bbq for what you will pay , we 'll be skipping this place in future .
american	there wasn 't necessarily anything wrong with the burger , but at this price , you are pushing into " gourmet " burger territory and gourmet this ain 't . frankly this a step up in price from the five guys and in-n- outs of the world and a noticeable step down in quality . as such , i can 't say i really see a reason to eat here .
american	i found the burger utterly uninspiring . it 's pretty standard diner fare , except they don 't do it particularly well . it feels a bit like eating at a cafeteria with waitresses . the staff is friendly enough , and the prices are fair , but they need more flavorful food , better decor , and less cheap feeling furniture . maybe a decent lunch option of you work within walking distance .
american	exploring pittsburgh was a blast , but osteria 2350 was not one of the highlights . the food was blah and nothing to write home about . the low ratings from the 15 previous reviews are spot on . didn 't know about the connection with cioppino . might check that place out next time we are in town visiting . we will not be going back to osteria though .
american	i had the salmon kale salad and honestly think i got ecoli poisoning from it . going to gi tomorrow if diarrhea does not let up . ruined my trip to vegas - what a waste ! ! ! ! ! ! also everything took forever , including just getting the bill .
american	nice looking place but food was very average and i expect more for $ 30 entrees . very similar to houston 's or white chocolate grill but not nearly as good as those .
american	i can see how people enjoy this restaurant as it was busy with baseball & softball teams . kids were chewing down as parents ate and enjoyed adult bevies . however , the food was mediocre and left me with a stomach ache and my son got sick . the staff was super friendly , but the food was not good .
american	ate here on saturday and i ended up getting food poisoning here i don 't know if it was from the chicken nuggets or the spicy mc chicken that i got but it was from something my stomach hurt on that day and the following day worse feeling ever on top of that the employees at this mcdonalds are lazy don 't give a damn slow especially when it comes to the drive thru all i have to say is that this is one of the worse mcdonalds locations in las vegas and that 's saying something because there are a few more like that .
american	ordered a cheese omelet with pancakes . it was overdone and kind of bland . pancakes were just ok and they flaked so much i thi8nk they were a little undercooked . tiny amount of syrup brought out i had to ask for more . for $ 8.95 it was a lot of food but honestly it was just mediocre .
american	i could tell the one line cook in the back doing my order was new as he received constant instruction from the guy at the counter . i think he accidentally used tortilla mix , because the pancakes i received looked nothing like the one 's depicted here from april 2015 . they were flat and rubbery ... like a nasty grey-ish , flavorless crepe . the whole crew was very friendly , though , so it 's sad the food wasn 't awesome .
american	ate here recently , the diner was empty when we walked in sat , ordered standard breakfast food came out quickly in large portions but was just blah they appear to use margarine instead of butter food was very greasy quantity is no excuse for poor quality a lot of restaurants don 't seem to get that won 't be back
american	when i got my food it wasn 't hot it was warm ... bacon wasn 't crispy , pancakes were flat and their country gravy wasn 't homemade . i 've made myself homemade country gravy before and theirs isn 't . this was first time going here and more likely my last .
american	the fried chicken was dry , the portions were enormous and pretty expensive , and everything was pretty meh . felt very processed and not really as home-cooked and fresh as it could have been . yams seemed to come out of a can . i respect what they 're trying to do , but it just wasn 't up to snuff , especially not for 11 $ per plate . left us feeling heavy and weighed down and totally regretting our decision .
american	today , 7 / 25 / 12 we drove up to try it again . one server trying to serve 8 tables ! one hour to get our food . fish ' n chips excellent as was the steak salad . many flies to contend with !
american	the atmosphere was nice . felt like oldtime vegas and our server was good . so , one star for that . and one star for the apple martini ... the best part of my meal ! i ordered the veal parmesan and it was dry and a dinner salad that was swimming in dressing . my bf order the ravioli and it was fried ( what the heck ? ) . for the cost of this meal , i would rather have gone to the roulette wheel and bet all on green 0 .
american	so so yummy . mambo omelet very average . potatoes over cooked , very dark and greasy . staff were extremely friendly
american	all of our food was cold from the eggs to the bacon . the potatoes were so cold none of us ate them . there was a large piece of the egg shell in my eggs benedict . the stuffed croissant was cold . definitely will not be back !
american	one of the worst and most expensive meal 's i 've eaten . when you spend $ 180 on dinner for two you expect it to be fabulous . the only thing good about the evening was desert and very nice and knowledgeable server .
american	real classy bellagio. i realize this is a design flaw , but surely patrons paying hundreds for meals expect a little class & privacy to enjoy it obviously the people posting these reviews have extremely low standards for food & service we do not sorry - but i really have nothing good to say about this restaurant , and we will not return * * * i wrote this review some time ago - but for some reason it never posted - now the restaurant is closed - i wonder why ! ! ! * * *
american	terrible . not only was the buffet half of the size it used to be , the food was very bad . it was dried out and either too salty or flavorless . poor selection . it was a sad shell of the great buffet it used to be . if you want a good vegas buffet don 't come here . you 'll be disappointed . there are several other much better buffets here for comparable prices .
american	the service here is the worst i 've ever seen . it took forever to get our order taken , after that it took over 30 mins to get food . one person in my party ordered a black bean burger and the beans were not cooked . my other coworker also wants me to add that he had pickles in his falafel .. " who does that ? "
american	got the pizza eventually it was like wet , saturated in like grease i assume but it looked like water so off the get go it looked gross . go and pick the slice up and the pizza falls apart in half ( uploaded a photo ) the pizza itself tasted pretty alright even being wet and in half at this point but all of these events that happened in my 8 minute stay here had to be documented but you 'll be too drunk to care because this is vegas haha . don 't be a dick asian guy
american	we order the steak skillet . the potatoes were boiled and had no seasoning . so they tested like boiled water . tryed to order a chicken sandwich , but they were all out of chicken . so i ordered pancakes and bacon instead and asked for the bacon wasnt crispy like i asked . they lady said she would bring me a new order , but never got it . we wont be coming back !
american	literally the worst food i 've ever had . i 'm from the coast of nc and know seafood . my body also knows / tells me when to not eat something ... that was tonight after ordering a $ 95 seafood dinner . oysters and clams were nothing less than rotten . literally . i still can 't get the smell off my hands . no one apologized , blinked an eye when they saw i sent back 98 % of my $ 95 meal . there was 3 bites taken out . i 'm staying at the cosmopolitan . not shy of spending $ ..... where it 's worth it . # dontgetsick
american	we got calamari and deviled eggs for appetizers and the eggs were average and the calamari was chewy . the brisket my friend ordered was more like pot roast and the po boy sandwich was dry with over-ripe tomatoes that were mushy and grainy . we didn 't drink , so i can 't comment on those . the menu is small enough where you 'd expect everything on it to be good , but nobody was impressed and we won 't be coming back . 2 stars for good service .
american	it was by far worst food i 've ever had . the pesto parmesan grilled cheese i ordered was nothing more then soggy bread and on my second visit the hamburger was served completely raw in the middle . after having two bites i felt violently ill and had to deal with food poisoning for the following 8 hours .
american	once on a sunday and again on a monday . it cost $ 26.99 on sunday and $ 19 on monday . it 's alright , basic buffet . nothing to go crazy over . service was okay . on monday they were doing some sort of construction , they covered the corner of the restaurant with a black tarp so you couldn 't see what was going on ... and they sat us right next to it . it was inconsiderate to seat us and other parties near the construction . it was loud and smelly . my other complaint is that they don 't offer egg whites or turkey bacon , hence it being a basic buffet .
american	the service both times was very poor . the food was mediocre at best . breakfast - omelet was good , but the sides were not very good . lunch - turkey club was not very good , the turkey was from a package . overall nothing was very good .
american	sauces are oily and taste like it was poured out of a can , the lasagna was literally microwaved for 5 minutes and the salad wasn 't cleaned properly . save your money . pay a few more bucks and go to a cleaner , tastier place
american	both times they were served cold ! ! grease congealed on the plate cold ! i ate them anyway , bad decision but they tasted good- not worth being sick the whole next day tho ... too bad because it is a nice place but with bad kitchen issues .
american	nothing like spending $ 150 for 2 and leaving hungry . bar area i 'm sure is ok but the dinner was a bad experience .
american	we had the rueben and the meat was thick and tough . caprese salad looked great had lots of cheese , but greens and tomatoes were light on the plate . i would recommend onion rings as your side . beer selection is good , so a great place to stop for a drink .
american	we ordered the fish tacos and spinach / artichoke dip for appetizers . fish tacos were okay , dip was pretty standard . i had the chef 's special for main , a veal tenderloin wrapped in proscuttio served with gnocchi . the veal was pretty dry and the herbs they used made it kind of bitter . the gnocchi was alright . tbh , i think this place is a bit pricey for some of the types of food they serve . amy had a super cheesy mac and cheese that should not cost more than $ 10 ...
american	now the lentil soup is the only best thing to eat there and the hamburgers , ha ! pretty sure they are store bought . dolma was oily . now , out of now where , kebabs are made spicy . except for the chicken which wasn 't seasoned at all ! sadly , not coming back . i used to frequent this place and i was excited to introduce this place to family they love mediterranean . but even they knew this mediterranean food wasn 't good quality . i don 't care about the customer service , or the lack there of , but if you are going to have a poor attitude , your food better be the best in the city .
american	my coworker had a 20 percent off coupon . i ordered a gyro sandwich and instead of rice or fries i wanted a salad . i was charged $ 7 for a side salad substitution . annoying ! along with a bottle of water my bill with the coupon was $ 13 ! a bit pricey for lunch . food was too salty . didn 't finish most of it . i asked for a sprite on way out . as i was driving my sprite leaked . cheap cups , my beverage seeped through . go to mad greek on sahara and durango if u wanna go to a mad greek . they have happy hour from 11 to 7 and their patio is great !
american	waiter with the dark glasses and curly hair was awful and terribly rude . his actions showed clearly he didn 't want to wait on me . perhaps it was because i was the only one with different skin . the food was ok but the service sucked . i will not be returning again as that waiter does not need to be servicing people in this day and age of diversity .
american	my girlfriends biscuits were hard . the pumpkin pancake was horrible and my corned beef hash was average . a real disappointment considering this place was recommended .
american	more recently ... thought try again for st p day and got two reubens ... super excited until get home and we had no cheese , no sauerkraut , no thousand island ( 20 minute drive later in the evening after waiting all day for this sandwich ) - i was so mad i cried ! ! i called and the manager said he would discount the bill , we paid on a credit card . still paid full price for a meal that was missing all the main ingredients ! ! not sure if i care to try again here .
american	i was quoted 11 min from when i ordered . 25 min later i asked about my order and she brought it to me . wings weren 't hot anymore ( temperature ) . i saw the wings finished sitting in the kitchen and nobody was doing anything . won 't return .
american	had a fish sandwich which was just so-so . the french fries taste like store bought frozen fries . nothing spectacular ! the homemade chips were stale . i think they had been sitting around for a couple days ! i was not impressed !
american	the fried chicken was over fried and stale looking . how do you over fry fried chicken ? ! my blueberry lemonade was flat it was suppose to contain vodka , yeah right . my husband ribs smelled and tasted like rotten meat . the broccolini and mac and cheese was ok . oh their fries were also ok . never again .
american	i have eaten at aladdins in akron , columbus , and cincinnati and they 're very good . however the location in independence has a juicer that is unbelievably loud . it 's like eating in a construction zone next to the jack hammer . absolutely horrible . bring earplugs or eat somewhere else .
american	the hot pies were tasty , but i took a mini blueberry square to go and when i got home i found mould spores on the bottom parts of the crust ! they should be more careful with the items that they are keeping at room temperature .
american	new place in a great location . good beer selection and atmosphere ; however , food quality / value was well below average ( hot dogs , sliders ) . server was friendly but food was very slow to come out . i have a severe seafood allergy and when asked which menu items had seafood in it , no one was sure . doubt they will be around long if big changes arent made . focus on the drinks but avoid the food . wife 's tater tots were cold too . not coming back any time soon .
american	my chicken was cold and the service was rather poor . i dont think i will be going here again .
american	ordered hamburger and husband ordered a folded ground beef sandwich . so much grizzle that about a fourth of it was un-chewable . same with my husband 's sandwich . service was polite but slow . will not return . will not recommend .
american	had to hunt the waitress down to get drink refills . management was walking around cleaning tables off , but ignored or didn 't see our two empty drink glasses . had to ask for the check and once we finally got it she disappeared again . she wasn 't on the floor at other tables and the restaurant was only half full . the food was average . it was a disappointing visit .
american	the fries are just ok . the burger had a rancid taste to it - which usually means that they don 't scrape the grill often enough and the old burger grease goes bad . it makes me question the overall cleanliness of the place . harvey 's is a block away . go there . won 't go back .
american	not to mention the manager was then completely unapologetic . my boyfriend ordered a burger and fries and it was delicious . overall food is a hit or miss and service is blah .
american	usual poor service provided by pancake house . same old , same old .
american	our server was very attentive . the food was not that good . ok it was awful . the pretzel bun on my breakfast sandwich was very greasy and the hash browns were so salty they were almost inedible . they also tasted like a nasty cigar . my girlfriend 's beat ( ? ) sandwich had way too much aioli sauce on it and the aioli tasted like bad body odor . i 'm not a picky eater and i literally had a hard time swallowing the bite i took . almost made me puke . even our house coffees weren 't good , tasted burnt . how do you mess up hash browns ? we will not be returning .
american	as mediocre as it gets . deserves only 3 stars . overdressed calamari salad . ok for cleveland .
american	i am not sure how there system works as peps were just walking in to be seated . however the weather is nice outside a little loud but to watch people pass by is entertaining as its on the strip . food big portions careful what u order . our waitress passed us 3x without a word just asked for check . manager or lack thereof did not say anything when he seen us waiting for 20 minutes as other people were being seated that just walked in . i know he seen us because he hung out in front for awhile . just not worth the wait as the food was mediocre as well .
american	the food is way overpriced and mediocre in quality . the only saving grace is the view of the lake and it was a nice setting , especially from the patio . my advice , take a picnic lunch and enjoy in an outdoor setting . btw , the lake cruise is a great opportunity to see the lake up close . it 's a great ride and captain tom made it so interesting .
american	on top of that the manager was having a discussion with the servers near the kitchen door because the servers were complaining about the cook having an attitude ( couldn 't that be done somewhere besides the dining area ? ) and being slow . our server had an attitude the entire time as well , and even heard him complain about getting new customers and not wanting to clear off the tables next to us . negative experience all around , our food was ok but everything else was not pleasant to say the least .
american	have to say reminded me of 20 years ago eating at circus circus buffet . that was my last time i 've ever ate there and i 'm feeling the same way here . never again . food was terrible with no selection of anything decent .
american	the service is crazy slow and add in some " who cares " attitude from some low-rent servers . reason for 2 visits is that we were staying at the resort . i 've eaten there many times over the years and it has gone done hill , way down hill . there was a time that you could not beat a casino coffee shop for value and quality . neither exist here unfortunately . no excuse for soggy cold food especially when the restaurant is not busy . why can 't one item be brought out by itself ? why must it be part of a huge tray ? where is the food cooked --- detroit ?
american	ate there 2 weeks ago haven 't been back i got the turkey sandwich with the cranberry jam and cucumber i asked for mustard on my sandwich when i but into it none there menu clearly says pickle and chips when i open my bag no pickle chips aren 't the bag kind there who made except the taste super stale and greasy i waited for 5 mins to be helped when place was emptya a manager was at the register and a cashier there are to registers the other cashier is busy helping someone i go up to manager he looks at me says im not a cashier hell help you there are 2 registers
american	big fan of the wahlburgs ! ! ! very disappointing in service and especially the food did not live up to expectations would not recommend wahlburgers !
american	my buddy had the hash , which was very greasy and over cooked . the waitress recommended breakfast nachos ? not that good . chips piled with eggs , cheese sauce and then put under the broiler until it was completely dried out . the atmosphere and bar etc was very nice . but , not the food so much . my first and last time .
american	$ 16.50 for a burger , drink , fries and coleslaw . the hamburger was ok , with the exception of the bun being much too big . most upscale burger places include fries with their burgers , but fuddruckers does not . i paid $ 2.49 for the skimpiest portion of coleslaw , and $ 2.49 for 12 fries ( 12 ! ) . no one asked me how my food was , and none of the four employees i passed as i left acknowledged me . las vegas has many far-better burger places , so i won 't return to this one .
american	the coffee was at least a day old , the food was served cold . i can cook most of this food at home and it was not anything deserving of a good rating . the only thing that was good was the recees peanut butter pancakes . the waiter also tried to help us out and did not make us pay for the items that were terrible .
american	i 'm all for giving new small businesses a chance but never again will i give this place a chance no one wore gloves and hair nets i ended up pulling out a hair out of my food i myself have short hair not medium length brown hair . worst part was i already ate almost 2 slices before finding it .
american	was told by the waiter how good the steak sandwich was . it was so tough i couldn 't eat it . place was way over priced too ! we have been back to the gardens but not gertrude 's .
american	unfortunately , my waitress treated me like the patron of a half-way house , grunting questions and tersely delivering my food . further , for such a nice establishment , the food was barely above bland . i didn 't get sick , but this breakfast experience began a melancholic feeling of buyer 's remorse that followed me home to california that evening . staff other than the waitress were exceptional , fun and perfect for the location . unfortunately , the primary agent of my eating experience brought negativity to the entire stay in the hotel . on the positive side , there were quite a few veggie options , and on paper , the option i chose should have been amazing .
american	seafood was very very old and partially frozen and inedible . i was concerned about getting sick it was so bad . . all food not ready to go at seven am . they gradual roll out of food . expensive -30.00 . while it was breakfast in an incredibly beautiful hotel , i was very disappointed . some of the other restaurants were exceptional .
american	the bloomin ' onion was good , but the burger was mediocre at best . one side of the patty was almost burnt the other side just okay but the burger was pretty dry for a medium well done . sort of pricey for a hamburger and french fries and would not waste my money on that choice again . server was nice and service fairly quick at that time of day .
american	my po boy was not very good mostly bread very little shrimp , $ 14 weak tumbler glass margarita , my dads salmon was lacking in seasoning and it was on the high price end . hopefully dinner service is better but i will never eat there again .
american	i had the chicken pot pie . never again ! i 've had better at a fast food joint . their service is spotty , although today it was pretty good . i 'm just tired of paying for meals that i 'd rather not eat . probably won 't visit here again for awhile .
american	great location but the food was not good . i had the seafood quesadilla , i couldn 't even taste any seafood . i opened it up to see how much was inside , i saw maybe one piece of calamari and a few shrimp , it was mostly cheese . the quesadilla came with guacamole , all it was , was mashed avocados with no seasoning . in my book that 's not guacamole , it 's just mashed avocado . my husband had the perch sandwich and it was mostly bun , not fish , also with no seasoning / flavor and the fries were cold . it 's a shame , i hoped for better .
american	without a doubt , the most confusing menu ever ! ! confusing to the point of employees having to explain how to place an order . the food on the tray was unimpressive as were my girlfriends ribs . the sides were small my burger was good ..... but for dang near 40.00 for two people .... never again . 10 bucks a head is more like it .
american	ordered a barbecue sandwich . tasted ok nothing special until i started chewing something odd , a piece of aluminum foil . showed to one of the staff and after about ten minutes got some lame excuses but no apology . was offered to order something else but no thank you . and the big topper , they still charged me for it . don 't think i 'll be going back
american	normally , food is really good . had a lot of company , so i took our party there . breakfast was absolutely terrible . eggs not cooked ... one piece of ham in the omelet ... toast cold ..... waffle was just that ... a waffle .... cold . place was packed .... but again , food was terrible . other people sitting next to us were terribly disappointed also . we would have been much better off at eat n park ..... much cheaper too . will never go back for their breakfast .... and our waiter / manager kept telling us prior to us being served .... best breakfast in town ! ! ! !
american	was one of the worst dining experiences in vegas . not true bbq didn 't smell any smoke . rude service . we 'll never come back .
american	the hostess was rather rude when we asked if we could have a booth . i would have left right then but my husband was dying to try their burgers . he enjoyed it but said it was not really worth the price . i ordered the cobb salad . it was drenched in balsamic dressing that so over powered the meal it should have been called the vinegar salad . had the potential to be a great salad but wrong dressing choice and way too much of it ! when i asked the waitress about the dressing she rudely said ... " that is how its made here , " with no offer to correct it . i would not eat there again .
american	sangria was good-not amazing but good . bread came out and i was surprised at the time of bread and the fact that it had butter . it was decent , nothing special . got a salad to start . basic but the dressing was just " ok " and was lacking anything but lettuce and two tomatoes ( other salads that went by had peppers and cucumbers ) got the shrimp / sausage over rice . it was actually quite good , although lukewarm . overall i have definitely had better . i would give it a try again , though probably not anytime soon .
american	was surprised how bad it was , went to texas and and had same dish at a roadhouse there , it was so good ! but apparently this roadhouse does not get the same meat ! won 't be ordering that ever again !
american	ate there last night. selection was poor and the unlimited wine was putrid. would not return .
american	i ordered the mild boneless wings with fries and was completely disappointed . the sauce had way too much of a " buttery " taste and one of the ingredients the fries were seasoned with was sugar ! so disgusting . is this a new thing ? ? about an hour and a half eating there i got mild food poisoning . although it 's hard to 100 % blame them as the cause ... i would bet a lot of money my wings weren 't cooked properly . i 'll be sticking with buffalo wild wings .
american	what a huge disappointment . the place is dusty and very dated . the waitress screwed up our order , i ordered veal and received chicken . for the price of the food , i swear it tasted like a michelina frozen entree . really for over $ 22.00 , i should be getting fresh homemade pasta , not the crap i was served , it barely filled a soup cup . really bad place to eat . never been back , and never going back . stay away . by the way , comping a free pour drink doesn 't impress when your food is crap .
american	not only that , the manager brought over a chair for the poodle to sit at the table . i like dogs but not at resteraunts sitting at chairs . the manager said she claimed it was a " service animal " and he wasn 't allowed to ask for any documentation though . nothing like the smell of dog crap and pancakes .
american	big disappointment . prices are up , specials are basically gone . food was mediocre and overpriced . they took a lot of items off their menu that i liked in the past . this place has had a lot of ups and downs over the past 20 years . we ate there a lot in the past 2 years and it was very good . but now they 're definitely in a downward spiral . we 'll try again in a year or two .
american	ate there on 5 / 11 / 2014 the wings were not very hot and not as tasty as wing stop , three in our party had burgers and i had the sliders all were dry and flavorless like ground up cardboard , cooks must have had anything close to seasonings removed from their presence , at least a little salt and pepper would be a plus.don 't think we will be back , but the fries did have good flavor and were not cold .
american	not crowded service was good and the blt was good . good thing i did not go to the restroom before my food . bad sewer gas smell in the men " s restroom . when i mentioned it to the waitress she oh yeah it 's been like that , " i said get it fixed " " yeah " from her . paying the bill i mentioned it and the lady said we know " i said call a plumber " her response " well it 's been like that "
american	the food tasted like it had sat under a heat lamp for the entire day . maybe even the previous day too . even mcd 's has gotten away from that . plus not that much for what we paid . no thanks . should admit i 'm more a legs guy and not so much for the wings . i don 't think anyone in our party ordered wings either so maybe that 's why i wasn 't impressed .
american	actually , the biggest problem i had with this place was the extravagant price for the bland food . much better burgers and sandwiches in madison for a much more reasonable price .
american	i ordered the alfredo pasta that was close to 15 $ or around that general range to go . it came back and when i took it home there was no chicken . i realized that it was an extra 3 $ up charge that was a protein . they should have at least told me when i was sitting there with the rest of my friends . the wait staff is friendly . they could clean up the place but overall it was way overpriced and could do some renovating .
american	also , wait staff was slow and rude . my friend said his beer was ok , so one star .
american	my wife and i both ordered steaks . they were prompt with the salads and drinks . then we waited 30 minutes to get our steaks . asked one of the busboys to find our waiter , where is our food ? when the steaks came the were barely warm . he asked if i 'd like another . i don 't have that kind of time to wait again . the manager came by comp 'd our food and said he be back with his card for us to return on him . never saw him after 20 minutes . won 't be back to this outback .
american	poor food quality i 'll never go back there too many great choices in the neighborhood . mojo , first watch , general store to name but a few ! ! !
american	took out of town guests . were disappointed . my three onion tart was delicious , but i don 't think they need to add sugar to the tart pastry . my sisters fish was good . basically , the dishes themselves were fine though not exceptional . the bread was cold and the plates were cold , which is disappointing . the decor is very plain and not charming . why do they need a tv in the bar ? ! while noise levels were good , rooms feel cramped and crowded .
american	my wife and son ordered the italian beef sandwich and were very disappointed with it . it was very heavily flavored with black pepper ( overwhelming ) . now if that 's how its supposed to be , i apologize . i have never had this before and was caught off guard with the black pepper flavor ( and i 'm a hot sauce / spice freak )
american	i have eaten frozen pizza that tasted better ! first and last time i will visit , husband agreed with me ! !
american	ate there the other day and the service was ridiculously slow and when the three of us got our food it was cold , the buns for our burgers were dry and the meat was dry and old .
american	bacon was burnt , they forgot to add mushrooms to a ' mushrooms and cheese ' omelette , and to top it off i ordered a takeout bowl of soup and honest to god the waitress sneezed into her hand holding the styrofoam soup container and then said ' i 'll go get your soup ' . this is not my first bad experience here , but it sure is going to be my last . this place should have a lot higher standards if it 's going to keep operating in oakmont .
american	had beef hot links , baby back ribs , mac n cheese , collard greens and cornbread . i was highly disappointed . the links were over cooked to the point that they were mushy . the ribs were also over cooked . mac n cheese wasn 't very flavorful . greens and cornbread were the only two things i enjoyed .
american	horrible experience ! service was totally absent . i gave a waiter the empty coffee carafe and he never came back . the only thing i found good to eat was the cold shrimp and the omelet . most of the promised menu was absent . no sliders or shrimp & grits . no chicken wings . the meat they called prime rib was over cooked , dry and tasteless . the entertainment was a movie for the first hour and the a few women singing - i expected a choir .
american	did not like it . we ordered medium well steak came out med rare ! i ordered the salmon , asked for sauce on the side got butter instead . i asked if it had alcohol in it . it took 3 people to figure it out .then was told it had white wine . i said if i knew that i wouldn 't have ordered it . i said what if it was for a child , wouldn 't that be nice . i have had much better food at outback at half the cost . will never go back . not even half a star but isn 't on here .
american	i do have to say the prices are very fair . the service staff is very " alternative " lots of tats , bull nose rings , big hole ear stretch earnings , i don 't mind alternative but hygiene has to be there and i felt it wasn 't . they were out of about seven menu items and the service was very slow and lacked any genuine hospitality . i 'll give it one more shot because several friends of mine rave about the place but i was not impressed with my first visit .
american	meatless pasta pretty bland and overpriced for box penne pasta and a little vegetables and sauce . ice cream dessert was badly crystalized with ice , like it 's been sitting in the freezer for a very long time . overall pretty disappointing . server was friendly . place was really slow--very few tables .
american	waitress didn 't give specials , had to get bus boy to chase up a wine for us . calamari no taste , my wife had pasta that was hard just not cooked . bravo is better value , seems to be made for tourists or hotel stayers , am a pittsburgher who will never go back . definitely not worth the money .
american	upon arriving the man at the counter had his back to the door adjusting channels on the tv with a remote . he could no be bothered to turn around ad greet us until he was done choosing a channel he liked . ordered the italian beef sandwich with everything on it .. meh , it was just ok , had to add some hot sauce so it had some flavor . had the parmesan fries as well ... they were good if you added ketchup . won 't go back .
american	the bar area in teh back is so loud i couldn 't hear each other talk without yelling so we left . the first meal was just appetizers , drinks and dessert and was okay but nothing special . nachos are made with chips from a bag and they taste like it but dessert was good . next meal was a half rack of ribs and was absolutely terrible ... dry , crusty and over cooked meat and french fries were unseasoned and stale . was just glad i didn 't order an entire rack ... won 't try and eat there again .
american	my wife ordered the blackbean burger and it was dry and tasteless ! i got the mushroom swiss and i 'd rate it as " ok " ; i was expecting more ... for the price .
american	wouldn 't explain menu sat me in back private section . brought another dish with grits half cooked . terrible experience . another occasion had hair in my eggs after i almost finished breakfast made me instantly sick . don 't go breakfast bad ! ! ! ! ! !
american	about 10 minutes later he vomited up his pancakes . we asked a friend who also had the pancakes and found out she was ill as well . called cherries and after speaking with 3 people got nowhere . 10 minutes later a fourth person from cherries called and after explaining again what was going on was yelled at for not telling them sooner . do not eat there .
american	family of 4 and our grandson . one extra square of cornbread was $ 2 . macaroni and cheese is the kind from the blue box . meat was dry and overpriced . peach cobbler was inedible ( we took it to go or we would have sent it back ) . the sweet potato waffle fries were good ! next time , for $ 70 , we will go down i-17 to bobby qs and wait the 30 minutes for a table . this place was empty on a sunday afternoon . now i know why .
american	i ordered a sandwich with onion rings ... waitress delivered it with fries . my wife ordered a burger median rare , it came so well done it was barely edible . not while we were eating , or at the check out were we asked " how was everything .... " i think they knew !
american	cheap ingredients . pasta drowned in cheap oil ( certainly not virgin olive oil ) is a no-go . food served late and not warm enough ( should say cold , really ) rude service . make you wait even though there are empty tables . i do not recommend it .
american	ate there yesterday , salad had insect holes and was slimy i sent it back , i had salmon it was freezer burned and bad part was hidden underneath on the bottom side , scraped all the slimy freezer burn off ate the rest of the salmon green beans were soggy over oiled limp and tasteless the only good thing was that the potatoes were very good
american	now i like guys . 10 / 10 would recommend . the guys . not pita jungle . food was decent . ordered a flat bread .
american	first night just a hotdog and sweet potato fries . actually they were sweet potato chunks - not fries . kind of like leftovers - soggy and limp , too . my sister 's onion rings were so hard you couldn 't stick a fork in them . second night , my sister 's steak was over done . my salad was okay but certainly nothing to brag about . service was adequate but , like another review said , they don 't really seem to care . hostess was nice . won 't be going back .
american	i would rather eat at mcdonalds and i don 't like mcdonalds . save your money and spend it somewhere else .
american	service was not the greatest . the order was mixed up and belonged to another table , but the food was acceptable . the manager seems to not be involved in matters and that appears to have always been an issue there with the guy . i actually had an issue one time before and asked to see the manager as i was overcharged for drinks and he told the waitress that he was too busy to see me .
american	however , one teeth sticking rack of ribs and an overpriced cocktail later , i can safely say - save your money for prohibition two doors down . when swiss chalet can make a better rack of ribs , you know you 've got trouble .
american	agreed with another reviewer that for people with bags there are far too many tables . it seems like a busy place with decent drinks / food but service is very lacking . no leadership is visible whatsoever . decided on some tater tots with chili after the menu didn 't explode at me , and you can 't screw up tater tots . or chili . very average fare . prices were high for drinks but that is to be expected at the airport . not a bad experience but certainly not a good one . overall won 't be back on my next trip through charlotte to give the gourmet burgers a chance .
american	we waited what seemed like forever for a server to ask what beverages we wanted . as i looked around much of the servers look lost and like they don 't know what they 're doing . we ordered breakfast and one entree , entree wasn 't worth the price and apparently everyone else seated after us got their food before we did . never again .
american	the food was unexcusably awful . we started with the deviled eggs which were simply boiled eggs cut in half with onions and bacon bits . they were gross and definitely not restaurant worthy . we shared the swiss alps burger which tasted fine , not great , with un-melted swiss cheese and with bacon gone terribly bad ( how do you mess up bacon ? ? ? ) . then , to top of the evening , our table light went off and we sat in the dark for the remaining part of our dinner . the waiter came and left with no apologies , no comps and pretty much continued the level of service he gave us all night .
american	however , after eating there twice while visiting someone at the cleveland clinic i have to say that i was severely dissapointed . the service was mediocre , the food was just okay , and the prices were insanely high . if i knew anyone visiting the cleveland clinic , i would tell them to spend the $ 10 to go downtown to another restaurant rather than eat here . it was that bad . see my other review on the greenhouse tavern if you want some good food in cleveland .
american	after our dinner i felt different , the cocktail i had was pretty average at best , we waited a long time to get our meal and our help was not very helpful with suggestions . if you are dining in this general area i would suggest somewhere else like ladera or richardson 's . caio .
american	chicken and waffles .... then i saw them slice the cake . yes , its airport food , but $ 7 for a tiny slice of cake ? come 'on . didn 't even get a real piece ... for $ 7 , lolo you can do better . will update the review after i try the chicken , but not high hopes so far . was so shocked had to review before i even took a bite . poor showing .
american	it caters to people who have money but don 't have developed palates . similar to the yorkville retail , money but no style . peice of meat with steak sauce on the side . crème brule the same way it was served 20 yrs ago , really now ! . sorry marc i like your other restaurants .
american	the buffet had a good presentation but the end result , the taste of the food was not memorable , i could not think of a dish that i wanted to go back for and eat again and again like in other casino buffets . the only thing i could think about was the freshly squeezed oj that 's it . i will not go back to this buffet again unless their menu becomes tastier and exciting , on the other hand the service was outstanding .
american	the portions are dinky and the sausage patties were overcooked . i took a picture for you .
american	unfortunately the food wasn 't great and the service wasn 't good . however if you want to have a drink outside they have a rooftop patio
american	now we go in and the food is okay but it 's hit and miss , service is mediocre at best , and we never see anyone win on the machines . the bar staff is friendly but it 's quickly becoming a typical smelly bar .
american	there were a lot of stations with different types of cuisine like mexican , american , chinese , and italian , and i tried all of them . the problem was that while they all looked great at their stations , as soon as they were back at our table , they were cold and dry . i did admire their selection and stuff myself with food . i just wish it would have tasted as good as it looked .
american	our server seemed attentive for how busy it was . i ordered a hand made lemonade which tasted like maybe at one time it was lemonade but they stretched it out so much it just tasted like sugar water . it seemed like the slower it got the worse the service got. getting drinks took forever , dirty dishes weren 't cleared and there were flies everywhere . in fact as i watched another waiter bring chicken out to a customer she had to shoo flies away as she put it on the table . nothing memorable and nothing worth coming back for .
american	if you 're looking for a boxed burger on a not so good bun then this is your place , enjoy !
american	party of 14 . my new york steak - worse than gross . denny 's is like mortons compared to this . i ordered medium . barely ran past the fire . lobster mac n cheese disgusting . bearded waiter - convinced this stuff was going to be good ... maybe it is sometimes . people at our table really liked the bone marrow dish . crab cake was good . calamari was very good .
american	took forever to get our salads and have now been informed that the kitchen is backed up and it may be quite some time for our dinner ... really ? ? ? we have already been here an hour and had to beg for our salads . ready to blow this place very soon . mcdonalds here we come ! ! ! do not come here .
american	at least for today ...... broken grill ...... waiting 45 for a chicken wrap ( still hasn 't arrived ) many empty tables .....
american	i mean seriously put a better girl upfront because i was ready to walk out the second she started taking my order . made me feel so uncomfortable and like um hurry up what do you want . also it took 30 minutes to get a lemonade . i understand your busy and the food may take some time . but when i was a server i was taught your table should have beverages within 5 minutes of them sitting down . get some better employees cuz these ones got to go ! at least the very rude one up front ! ! ! i was there last sunday morning ... im sure you can narrow it down to who was working then !
american	my chicken pita trio was sad . my pita had no flavor in it what 's so ever , not to mention fell apart soggy from the water off the lettuce , it wasn 't even closed at the bottom . i asked for half potatoes and half salad ( they had 6 salad choices that looked decent ) and was handed flavorless / textureless potatoes and a " salad " of the plain julienned lettuce they use for wraps , and when i say plain i mean with zero on it , not even a sauce / dressing . seriously ? i ordered from this place once off just eat and thought the awful order was a fluke , i was proved wrong .
american	the decor is cheesy . better steak in vegas . gordon should step up his game or i 'm going to yell at him !
american	terrible across the board . there was not one redeeming quality here . the payment / seating process is slow . the food selection is poor and taste is bland . awkward sneeze-guards . piles of dirty dishes everywhere . the one thing that i must emphasize ... i had to scrape the chocolate cake out of my mouth with my spoon . that is not an exaggeration . scraped it out . take a hard pass on this one , trust me .
american	i had high hopes for an expertly crafted burger . but to my surprise i will just have to wait a little longer . the burger was so salty that i wondered if perhaps one of the chefs was listening to and going along with mercy me 's title track " shake . " it is a very catchy tune ! and the issue i had with the fries is that they are made for skinny people since they somewhat resemble shoe string potatoes . but i guess i am dating myself with the shoe string potatoes . a long ago staple . now for the positive -4 stars for friendliness and service .
american	price is not a concern when the item fulfills the promise . this failed miserably . our waitress led us to believe a salad was included--it was not . i enjoyed the space but i will wait for them to earn more ratings .
american	server offers fries or fruit instead of veggies . kids of course say yes . $ 2.95 upcharge per kids meal ... never disclosed by the server and not printed on the menu ( kids burger comes with fries after all ) . server got our fries order wrong ... told us that when we asked for " s & p " ( as it is described on the menu ) she thought we meant sweet potato . huh ? both adult salads were filled with limp , wilted , brown lettuce . at the end of the meal the server offered to get the manager , then came back with no manager and a list of excuses . never coming here again .
american	beer ? tasty . i had the stout . pizza ? horrible , horrible , horrible . a waste of a good wood for the joint 's wood-fired oven . the crust had absolutely no flavor . devoid of salt . no carbon burn from the oven . flatter than the desert 's floor . no bubbles in the crust . my pizza came with a sunnyside egg . the egg was sunnyside decimated and the white was runny . and with this review i do solemnly swear that i will never finish a restaurant meal if it is not good . if the first bite is terrible , back it goes to the kitchen .
american	atmosphere : 4 / 5 food : 5 / 5 service : 0 / 5 drinks : 1 / 5 inconsistent drinks , clearly depends on which bartender is there. food is always fantastic. service is always disappointing , just terrible. if the company is only looking toward their image , they will fail , as there are better restaurants nearby that can provide a consistency in all areas. will reiterate : horrible service. never fails in that area each time we visit .
american	no bbq and chicken was cubed . in all pretty much cut up chicken breast with coleslaw . how can you claim it 's pulled bbq chicken ? house fries cooked ok ... however barely any cheese , a few squirts of bbq sauce and no chives . boring . needed ranch dressing to make it exciting . will only come back for a drink otherwise no need to waste money on less than mediocre food .
american	my wife 's food came out as if it had been dunked in the fryer ... the server had to be asked for more coffee and even then it took her a little while to get it ... then , it wasn 't even warm . i asked for more cream and of course it never came . the server had work a quick turn around and it showed ... i don 't blame her , but you have to have a little more enthusiasm in this job even if you are tired . unfortunately we will never return !
american	food is served in a high end cafeteria style but tables can be tough to come by since many customers hold tables against the rule of waiting until they have their food . no policing of tables and bussing is very slow . line to pay can be long and slow . last time we had to request ice several times since fountain was out . they also hold numerous tables as reserved causing more congestion . a nice feature is the live soul music but it does cause difficulty in getting through checkout . cooks are generally very pleasant and courteous . very hard working . good for lunch , avoid at night or during rush periods as the place does not seem well managed .
american	i was not impressed by the deserts , but i did like the location and environment they had created . i ate here about a month after they opened and when visitors want to visit we normally suggest they go to the take out window on the side rather than having a sit down meal inside .
american	the spankings there when you don 't finish your burger are brutal we saw a paddle get broke on one man . the food is horrible greasy burgers and no flavor i actually ended up getting sick afterwards . would not be a place we go back to .
american	1 / 5 , 4.99 special , makes me wish i spent it on tim hortons instead . bread was so buttery that it was no longer toasted , sausages were dry . display of the food was so unappealing . overal : we found food still stuck on the utensils , will most definitely not be back
american	buffet restaurant sweet tomatoes was our biggest delight . food was dry . coffee not great . desserts sad . atmosphere was absent . we struggled with crab legs for about 20 minutes and were finished , when our low energy table host brought us a single shell cracking tool . cravings was simply a waste of good money and is strongly discouraged . hit your local crappy buffet wherever you 're from at half the price , and you 've had the same experience .
american	decor is modern and pleasant . food is good and portions presented well and adequate . my waitress was warm and friendly at the start , then as two and four tops started to fill up she obviously concentrated on those tables rather than me , a single . it took 21 minutes to finally get my check and another waitress had to get it and took care of the transaction . i tipped her cash for that , left nothing for my initial waitress and informed the manager of what had transpired . his reply-- " she 's out looking for a husband and quick tips . " rather than disappoint anyone , i decided to not return to this establishment .
american	we are eating fruit & eggs , not caviar . cuisine : breakfast facilities : need more attention . low paper towel and one stall , no toilet paper . food : nothing special . average quality . coffee tasted burnt , and food doused in canola oil . fruit was displayed nicely . likeliness of returning or recommending to others : not returning / recommending parking : private portion sizes : average price : over priced service : could stand to be more friendlier selection : basic type of meal- breakfast / lunch / dinner : breakfast
american	with all the hype and my expectation , i honestly wasn 't diggin ' it. i could get a better tasting shake n better tasting burger at in n out for a third of the price .
american	food : really bad and way overpriced ! ! ! ! service : very poor ... i think they hire food servers with no common sense or any people skills . overall : save your dime ... mosey on over to the food court after you stand there ogling over the animatronic alligator and fake fog . paying for overpriced , crappy food with bad service is not worth it .
american	breasted chicken and rib dinner = chicken great tasty and juicy . ribs tough = these babies will never fall off the bone . 6 guys went for ribs all agreed . too bad the ribs are what you come for .
american	however one of the worst meals i have had in phoenix . i had the chicken tenders . for $ 11.50 i thought they would be decent size tenders but no they were small . 2nd the tenders had no flavor and on top of that were tough . my friends burger looked good if i go back maybe the burger will be better .
american	service - terrific . food - blah . i had the chicken fried steak , it was bland as hell and horrifically greasy . my wife had the chicken kebab - it was at once overdone and yet smothered in butter , apparently to moisten it back up . if you are at all health-conscious , try another restaurant . if you are from texas or just like bland , fried food with good beer , this is your place .
american	ordered a patty melt it came with nothing but a burger and bread ... no onions no cheese no mayo ! they offered to redo it and brought back same , with cheese and not melted . still no onions like a patty melt had ! many times i have tried this place and the food and service continues to be bad . i think i 'm done trying after 5 visits , shame
american	i had the 3 meat item . all three where subpar at best . tri-tip was rubbery . ribs were just flat out terrible . pulled pork was super wet , almost like it sat in water . i should have known something was wrong when all three came drenched in bbq sauce .
american	best tip about this place : get the deviled eggs app !
american	i ordered the rueben and that was a mistake . although it was tasty , it was almost all fat and grizzle . i really struggled to finish it , but was so hungry after a long day of travel that i just pretended to be a lion on the serengeti and took it down . would not eat there again .
american	unfortunately sat at the bar for 20 minutes , took 5 minutes to get menu and could never place an order . a lot of staff , asked to place order and they kept passing the buck . phoenix does an amazing job so will wait til i 'm back in that city .
american	the worst buffalo chicken salad i 've ever had . chicken was cold with a 20 minute wait and then a longer wait because they didn 't put the buffalo sauce on . not cool .
american	the burgers , not at all what we expected . every part of it was cold from the patty to the mass of bacon and unmelted cheese . didnt care for the fries either . onion rings and shakes were very good though .
american	recommend you go and have a beer and the pretzel and cheese appetizer ; it is very , very good . don 't stay for dinner . we tried the devilled eggs ; three halves for $ 5 . not bad , but an overwhelming smoke flavor . also tried the chicken meatballs , which were deadly dry . the sweet potato cannoli was inedible , and the cajun chicken was so salty none of us could eat it . the salmon was okay , and the fries are good . we went late and they were out of many of the entrees . we 've eaten at a lot of restaurants in scottsdale , and this is probably the worst ; over-priced and over-salted food .
american	food was ok , came out cold . not sure if it was the kitchens fault or the waitress . service was deplorable . i usually go to blue 32 which is next door , but the wait was too long that night so i thought i would try harvey american . next time i will wait it out at blue 32 .
american	$ 28 for a steak that was over cooked , they don 't have steak sauce , which usually isn 't needed , but with this steak it is for sure . if i do come back , it 'd be for a beer only .
american	prepare for disappointment , however . the " susci " while beautifully prepared is bland and falls flat . the short rib appetizer is much better , but disappointingly small serving . got the seafood pasta of crab , lobster , and shrimp . the seafood portion is generous , but the flat pasta sticks together and congeals into a doughy mess . finally , the hostess was rude and obnoxious . come on , your job is to just seat people and answer basic questions . you can 't be polite ? overall , spago is much better bang for your buck in las vegas .
american	the beer selection isn 't great . the glasses our beer was served in was dirty and we had to ask for a new glass . when she brought back a new glass it was still dirty ( had crusted food on the rim of the glass ) . prices were decent . i wouldn 't recommend it as there are many other places to better spend your money better .
american	service was spot on . food was terrible . we got the beer cheese fondue - bland , buffalo shrimp - okay . beef brisket - boring and dry . side of mac and cheese - not good . so wanted to love this place - location and patio so fun . but food just really wasn 't good - at all . very disappointing .
american	food is good . especially the fried chicken . service is horrible . takes forever to get a drink and some of the waitresses seem to hate their job . snobby attitudes and all around bad service . i will spend my money elsewhere until they retrain their staff .
american	hamburger was barely mediocre at $ 17.60 for a plain one . meat was tasteless & in a ball , so didn 't fit bun well . fries were good . french onion soup not hot enough - wasn 't that brown crusty melted cheese we like and too . sweet . asked for mayo-got one teaspoon -no kidding . service was not greatest , so overall , not going back & rated it one star ( especially since it was overpriced )
american	the food however fell short , i don 't understand the hype . the hand cut fries are far from the best , boardwalk fries , smash buger , five guys , etc. all has them beat . they remind me of trying to make them at home with the wrong equipment , flavorless . their famous sandwiches also fell short of flavor , way to much starch when they combine their thick italian bread and the fries pilled on top your choice of meat . i had the favorite pitts-burger and was very disappointed , no flavor , the meat was mush and topped with the fries it was gross . the pizza however was good .
american	even though it was extremely slow on a saturday afternoon with barely anyone there , i sat at the bar and had to get the bartender 's attention after sitting there for 15 minutes waiting for my check . after the food was delivered , she didn 't bother to come back and check on me - then she left and another guy took over , and he never spoke a word to me the whole time i was there until i asked for my check . taphouse sliders - flavorless and greasy . shrimp mac & cheese - rich , but more like cheese soup with shrimp and noodles
american	service was fine . hostesses very nice . food was ordinary . out of 5 in our party , four would not return . the fifth had left so didn 't weigh in !
american	disappointed in the turkey burger . i was hoping for ground turkey meat . not the processed ' white meat ' turkey burger . it was tasteless . its ridiculous how extra sauce is $ 1 also . fries were okay .
american	food was way overpriced and quality was eh . it was all frozen stuff that they are just reheating . they have a beautiful location on the river . i would think of the quality and price were to change they could really do some business . guess that explains why there was only 1 table of people in there .
american	that 's about it . food , i 've had better & for a better price . yes , i agree other places in toronto are more " rustic , " but i go for the food not necessarily decor ... especially with what they charge at this place . i am from perú & i will not be going back to this place . would not & will not recommend it to anyone i know . with so much in toronto , this place needs to find something that 'll keep people coming back for more .
american	meats were ok , and servers were friendly and quick . salad bar was not good , more like golden corral quality yet much smaller . beware they charge a water conservation fee . wtf ? they charge for having tap water on your table . dessert was like cafeteria too . overall not worth the money .
american	arrived here for brunch and we were impressed by the atmosphere . we didn 't have reservations but the place wasn 't busy and there were plenty of tables available but for some reason we were told there was a half hour wait. we finally got a table and our waiter was as bland as our meal . the menu is overpriced and under flavored . i could fathom a bad meal but not in the company of bad service and high prices .
american	service wasn 't that great and i think hot sauce should always be given with fried chicken & waffles. with brunch options coming out the wazoo around the west end i 'd rather go elsewhere .
american	burgers were good , but nothing about makes them stand out amongst all the $ $ $ burger joints . service was slow .
american	the food is awful and really expensive . the ribs were dry , salty , and had pesto instead of bbq sauce which overpowered whatever smokiness the ribs had . pesto was good on its own . the pickles weren 't good , baba ganoush wasnt good either . i tried a piece of the tri-tip and that was good . drinks are also more expensive than most places . i got charged $ 28 for a double shot drink . music was all backstreet boys and nsync great place to take someone you hate if they 're paying
american	the menu was difficult to read ( could be that it was just not familiar to me ) . the salad was ok but the house dressing was basically just oil with some bland herbs . the pizzas took forever to come out and when they did they were soggy in the middle which meant i had to cut and scoop with a fork . not the way a $ 20 pizza ( 10 " diameter ) should be . the server was very nice but anytime we needed anything he was nowhere to be found and took a long time to find him . i don 't plan on being back anytime soon .
american	food was so so . our party ordered the " spicy " chicken wings as an appetizer but no one tasted anything remotely close to " spicy . " i had the fish and chips ... the batter was good and the fish moist , well prepared . service was a bit slow , considering they were not busy at all when we were there .
american	service : our server didn 't have much to say , we had to ask about the specials , soup , etc . food : the bottom bun on the med rare burger was so soggy it fell apart as i picked it up . sent it back , server was unapologetic . a forgettable experience .
american	have had better for the price . fyi ... take your own bottle of wine and pay the corking fee ... crazy expensive for average bottles ( unless you are looking for the rare / $ $ $ $ bottle )
american	nothing really makes it stand out . no decorations . service : it was fine . nothing special . they got you what you needed when you needed it . price : $ 16 for 4 chicken tenders . biggest rip off in vegas out of all the places we dined . note that they were frozen garbage . food : nothing special about the food here . it was bland , lack of flavor , and a lot of the late night menu is frozen stuff out of a bag . i ordered off their regular menu the vietnamese spring rolls . the sauce had no flavor . too much cilantro .
american	fairly loud but it 's expected . got appetizer and 2 meals with soda and total came to a little over 55 $ which wouldn 't be bad if the food tasted better . waiter was fast but i drink a ton of soda and only checked on us 2x with my 2nd refill of soda being as i got the check . my wife likes this place but i like angry crab shack a little better i think .
american	flight of wine was $ 16 . apps started at about $ 11 . wait staff was more concerned about the 2 large tables behind us and didn 't come back to us so we walked out . plus $ 8 for a chardonnay is ridiculous . sample was $ 3 . barrel run sample is $ .50 . highway robbery for $ 3 .
american	but u pay alot of money for no service . u place ur own orders like a food truck but ur in a restraunt . 13 bux for a wrap . not worth it
american	roast chicken cobb salad ... it came with half of a iceberg lettuce , literally that was the salad with some dressing and they claim there was puree avocado which i could not taste any , and chicken was invisible . i actually asked where was the roast chicken when the server brought it . i could not see it until it was pointed out to me .... yeah ... and that plate was $ 14 ... seriously .... not recommended .
american	fun pool table . decent happy hour . the food looked amazing at first . chicken fried steak and the 90s fatboy burger were good but after i had the burger i got insanely sick . i feel like there was a poor preparation of the meat and mishandling of the avocado in the burger . i don 't know if i would consider going back if they don 't know how to properly cook and prepare food
american	service was reasonable but , food was very bland . i even ordered a special . i upgraded my regular cheese steak to a southwestern style but , still was very plain . i won 't be visiting again .
american	they had a band the night i was there , it was out on the patio . couldn 't hear myself . talking was impossible unless you yelled . we sat as far away as possible . when i got there i ordered a gin and tonic . $ 7 , really ? did i mention the tonic was flat and i believe there was no gin it , as i could not taste any . the food was normal bar food . nothing special , it didn 't stand out to get me to return . so if you like mediocre this the place for . as for me i 'll take a pass .
american	i wanted to kill all the biltmore business people in there too . with a sword .
american	we ordered the margarita pizza on the gluten free crust . it was a little dry and needed salt . the sauce wasn 't enough to wet the pizza and so we asked for a side of sauce . he charged us for it without telling us . it also needed flavor . we also had a pizza with sausage . this was better but still needed something . we had 3 sodas , a half salad and 2 small scoops of gelato . $ 80 ! i 'm sorry but this is too much for the quality of food . never again .
american	employees were fair , however the young man , christian was very nice . knew his lines and promotions very well . the food on the other hand left something to the imagination . the burger , the farmer brother , was dry . the charbroiled taste was too strong . tasted like charcoal . the onion rings weren 't bad , but also to dry . not worth the price .
american	however , the steak was a joke . i ordered the seared steak which might as well been a tv dinner piece of salisbury steak . if the steak was a 1 / 2 " thick that would be a stretch . also , the steak was about 4 " s long . next , there wasn 't a seared mark on the steak . to top it off , the plate came with my steak and spinach and zero presentation . it looked like a serving from a school cafeteria . to think they wanted over $ 30 for this . do yourself a favor and have drinks and go it somewhere else to eat . it was an embarrassment to take 7 colleagues there .
american	atmosphere was nice ........ waiter was great ...... do not order the ny strip , over cooked and more than half of it was fat
american	food was ok . price was a bit steep for ok atmosphere and food . had a porter house steak that was pretty tough .
american	food was tasteless which is great for people that were born in the early 1900 's . if you don 't mind hearing all the old people talking loud cause they didn 't turn their hearing aides up . service was mediocre . i would not recommend it to anybody that like flavor in their food and likes a little peace and quiet while they eat
american	over 30 minutes to wait for a hot dog that by any means was not gourmet is way too long . i was not expecting to get such a teeny tiny hot dog either . although our waiter was nice the service overall was very very very slow from the time we sat til the time we left . and we all left hungry .
american	looks very elegant however . the food did not exactly complement it . the food was not the greatest , my chicken was undercooked , nachos were moist and not crunchy at all . pasta was quite hard as well . was expecting alot more from this place .
american	you failed miserably , next time i 'll just order a shrimp pizza from little cesars .... and save $ 280.00 ! maybe thats why it 's in the basement ..... come to portland or seattle and learn all about " good , fresh seafood "
american	you have to order everything a la carte . the reason i 'm giving this place a 2 star review is because the service was horrible . it took us about an hour and a half to get out food and it was a slower monday night . server was not attentive as far as refills etc .. again the burgers tasted good however not cooked to what we ordered i noticed there was a lot of frustrated tables . we certainly we 're not the only ones . the table next to us had to return their burgers not once but twice bc they were cooked wrong . save yourself the time and money and go to 5 guys or b spot
american	our server was not friendly and was slow . drinks and food tasted good , but portions were extremely small . my $ 12 coconut old fashioned was about an ounce of actual drink coupled with a lot of ice . my husbands $ 12 pinot noir was half a normal serving at any other restaurant . the $ 9 deviled eggs and chi orzo sausage came as three and had the thinnest slice of sausage you could barely taste it . the pa burger was just ok . all in all very disappointed in the commoner . will not recommend to anyone or be returning . the hotel monaco though was very appealing . it 's nice to see a hotel like this in pittsburgh .
american	but the servers dress was inappropriate for a breakfast place if i wanted to see that much skin i would have gone to hooters at least there they don 't look like they just got out of bed .
american	service : questionable , server seemed untrained and uncertain of how to do the job food : acceptable , but the menu was oddly limited and had nothing in the way of sandwiches or other medium-sized meals pricing : not totally out of line , but a little high for what you get
american	while there is a large quantity of different food options , the quality makes many of those options inedible . there were a few different things that i was able to eat but for the most part i filled up on the desserts and not the actual food .
american	service : counter service . friendly , in a swedish kinda way . food : ok - i had the chicken wrap . it took 30 minutes to get a chicken wrap . 30 minutes . and it was not crowded . it tasted pretty good . i assume it took 30 minutes because they were waiting for the chicken to mature enough to slaughter it , butcher it , dress it and cook it to put in my wrap . 30 minutes for a chicken wrap ? really ?
american	a today went out for lunch with my brother and friend ... my meal was going great only to find a long black hair in my food ... i was so disgusted i had to spit out my food ... the manager came over and all he offered me was an espresso ... without an apology
american	waitress was rude , and passive aggressive . $ 38 dollar steak over cooked came with no sides . waitress said " well it 'a a steak house " i 've been to many steak houses they come with sides . steak was bland had no flavor , i 've had a much better steak at denny 's dinner . waitress threw some wicked shade when we said no to desert . overall just a horrible experience ruined our night .
american	lame ! ! no more business from me ! ! ! ! cheeba hut is much better and a couple buildings to the east ! this location has gone down hill ; used to be very busy years ago and hardly has anyone in it now .
american	at one point gt was a great place for dinner now just bad food and bad service ...
american	they have since " changed " the menu several times and remodeled . the bar side of the remodeling looks really nice , but it 's like they did that part , ran out of money and forgot about the restaurant area . in addition their most recent menu change did not include any additions but they took several items off . at this point , i 'll go there for drinks or dessert to watch a game , but i 'm not a fan of dining here anymore .
american	gone are the chimmichurri wraps , quinoa and tabouli dishes , no more are the vegetable pastas . you can pick burgers , flatbread pizzas , or pulled pork . they 're not bad , but i can throw a rock and hit four more places to get those foods . additional star removed because they can 't seem to keep their own hours- out of four attempts to visit , they 've been open once during their posted hours . the fried zucchini is about the only option left that is at all interesting left on the menu , and even that 's not actually healthy at all .
american	times have changed , not the value it was nor attention to the customer . everyone is friendly but waiting at the register for 20 minutes while the pizza i ordered got cold . 15.95 for what i consider 3 slices of product . too bad .
american	i 'm my opinion the executive chef has lost his passion to cook . i 'm sure you have other chefs waiting in line that can do much better .
american	we came here for a birthday dinner and had the worst experience at a leroy fox to-date . the service was slow and unattentive ( it was a slow sunday night ) and our food was delivered incorrectly . we ordered the salmon with honey glaze and was brought just the salmon . we informed them that this was incorrect and they brought out a cup of the honey glaze and was told : " i know this is not what you ordered but here you go . " needless to say , we won 't be back to this location anytime in the foreseeable future .
american	food : our orders that were protein-based were exceptionally well prepared with obviously very fine ingredients . vegetables were mostly undercooked and starchy . all were served on absurdly large plates , obviously trying way too hard to be chic fine dining . service was awful . " we 'll see if we can find a place for you " sort of mentality . we were not given cocktail menus at the start , our waitress totally lacked confidence and finesse . you can bring fine dining to madison without pretension and faux-exclusivity . i live in brooklyn and can smell bullshit a mile away . this place is bullshit .
american	my expectations were set by the many , many raving reviews , but it was a waste of money . ordered the montagu and the ingredients were very skimpy . the sandwich was primarily bread with vague and scant flavors ; nothing like anyone 's descriptions . this sandwich could have come out of a vending machine . salad portions are a rip-off . not worth the money or effort . lame .
american	the steaks were mediocre at best , and the wait time to receive anything was way too long . they charged for everything , even extra for steak sauce , and the prices were way too high , even by vegas strip standards . they obviously rely on gordon ramsay 's fame to draw people in . there are many other places in vegas to get a fine dining experience . i would not recommend this place to anyone .
american	buttermilk chicken and red velvet waffles are amazing and the mixed cocktails are tasty and not diluted . shrimp and lobster fritters have a great sauce . sides are great although wee served cold the first time and subsequently redone . the service lacks all round . from the lackadaisical greeting to the always constant need to ask for water , cutlery , the check , there is a basic lack of service . such a shame because the food really is tasty !
american	terrible service already . let 's wait for the food and see how it taste . first time at oyshi . maybe last ?
american	all of the server staff stand around doing nothing , one was playing with her hair near where the food is picked up . the only server who seems to be busy and knows what she is doing is a lady named joey . the rest of the servers all are pretty much useless .
american	i like applebees as a chain , but i 've decided to not go to this one any longer . i 've had a few meals here with friends and family . almost always a meal is sent back because things are under or over cooked or very bland . cold shrimp , soggy fried shrimp and stale items on salads are just a few reasons i won 't go here again . also , my last visit we did not send anything back to the kitchen , but two tables around us did . just not up to the standards that applebees should be expecting .
american	the room was freezing cold ( in the low 60s ) and the food was absolutely abysmal . i couldn 't imagine any circumstances where i would find myself eating at city tavern again .
american	if you can 't handle the pressure of " restaurant week " then perhaps you should reconsider participating in it . the self-proclaimed " maitre 'd " harrassed customers , and whether veronica is aware of it or not , she comes off as completely passive-aggressive and unprofessional . a restaurant of this supposed caliber should not have people at the helm who haven 't the slightest clue when it comes to customer service . harvest should seriously reconsider the employment of an individual who will only drive business into the ground by destroying it 's reputation .
american	long john silvers as a company should be absolutely ashamed . total disgrace all the way around .
american	apparently they ran out of silverware - how does a restaurant that has been opened and established run out of silverware ? ? wings are very good but i won 't go back because of the service . received the wrong drinks and food took forever .
american	biscuits ? sorry , we 're out for awhile . hashbrown potatoes ? sorry , we 're out right now . fries ? no we 're out of those too . so i order the panini breakfast sandwich without meat . when i get to my gate , i see the sandwich is also lacking egg ( meaning it 's just the cheese & condiments on it ) . brilliant folks working here ... brilliant !
american	the server was fine and very attentive when we came in . after ordering the food , it took forever to get it . on his recommendation i ordered the corned beef sandwich with extra crispy fries and asked for an upgrade to truffle fries- $ 3 extra . best thing in the sandwich was the bread and it was soggy . the fries were limp and i had to ask if they upgraded to the truffle fries-which he said they did . not ! ! ! ! my husband had their signature fish and chips and it was tasteless . so the over-all meal was a fail . gordon ramsey is hard in the hell 's kitchen crew-he needs to be hard in his crew .
american	just so happens that that area has servers , so i couldn 't sit there as my husband was bringing food and i was told the servers would " lose out . " i moved our stuff to a general seating area while my husband is being told he can 't take food out to where i was . he gets out of line , finds me and gets back in line to order food . this is so ridiculous . decide if you 're a bar or a restaurant , servers or no servers . just told i can 't have the grilled cheese i wanted because that is only for lunch . what a pain .
american	breakfast should not cost $ 30 ! service was ok .
american	i wish i could take thanksgiving back . food would have been ok for an outback steakhouse . no table service-no plates bussed . no water filled . no wine list offered to us . every time i asked the waitress for something she said let me get the manager for you . " sorry , we have a large party upstairs-things are never like this . " guess what ... that 's not my problem- if you are understaffed for a major holiday , close your restaurant . i gave two stars because a bottle of wine was comped for us . i wish i could go back , i would 've paid double the check amount to have eaten somewhere else .
american	why , why , why would anyone eat here ? because they 're desperate , that 's why . traveling for work and just looking for a decent meal . the food was edible . note to self , don 't set your expectations too high . only order steak & potatoes . the suggested wine tasted like when we put ice cubes in the cheap box wine on a hot summer day . except it wasn 't hot , or summer , or daytime . highly suggest avoiding br at all costs , unless applebees-canada is your thing . and don 't get me started about the management ...
american	i work night shift so i can 't find the coffee pots 2 . your ticket got lost between the waitress and kitchen 3 . we aren 't sure what happened , let me find out . - the lady never came back to tell us what actually happened . 4 . we went to the cashier to finally get re-fills on our coffee . an hour after arriving we still weren 't served and left without eating . we will never return to this location again . welcome to the west valley indeed !
american	the worker grabbed the flat bread . i again asked for the sub and pointed on the menu where it was and what i wanted . again he grabbed the flat bread . i tried still a third time that i wanted a sub and he rhetorically said you you want the flat bread . i proceeded to walk out and grab breakfast elsewhere .
american	might be worth putting on their site as we traveled across town instead of checking out a different bbq place .
american	attended a birthday dinner for my friend with about 10 others , we placed our apps and dinner orders and ended up waiting close to 2 hours for anything resembling food to appear ...... i mean we didn 't even receive the appetizer ahead of time ..... and no explanation as to what was taking so long until 2 hours later ..... the manager comes out to make sure we still want the food before they put it on plates ... really ? how about a manager appearance at the 45 minute or 1 hour mark ? we did get an apology and half off but still completely unacceptable for a ' wanna be ' upscale restaurant ...
american	maintenance guys were going through fixing and replacing lights during the event because they weren 't checked in advance . the room looked extremely low budget and the drinks were so over priced that mill ave looks cheap . the food was also very blah in flavor and not much for the cost of the place . i 'd recommend several other venues over this place such as the the monorchid ( which i 'd only rate slightly higher for location but the food was really good ) , the renaissance phoenix hotel at westgate which did a great job for our 2014 christmas party , or the wigwam resort where luke afb held it 's last air force ball .
american	" oooops .... there you go , no hair in your salad now .... " but we 're still going to charge you the $ 1 dollar for the salad upgrade ... this is my pleasant review if i wrote what i was thinking i 'd be put in jail . wow , yelp really needs to re-evaluate the zero star policy ...
american	beer was ok but food and service terrible . they spilled ketchup on one of the guest , another found plastic in the mashed potatoes the manager was made aware and tried to rectify the issues . salads came out after the entrees people who were supposed to get desserts finally was asked when everyone was ready to leave . as for myself i had the blue burger sirloin it was luke warm . i have driven by this place many times and will continue to drive by never to enter again .
american	second visit . as a place that aspires to southern cooking , especially bbq , lucille 's falls far short . beef brisket was tough ; bbq chicken was ok ; sides not so much . and how can you pose as a southern restaurant and not serve cornbread ? or hushpuppies ? good draft beer selection . service at the bar was friendly and quick . live music was good , not outstanding . if you 're a fan of good bbq , then there are much better choices in phoenix . avoid lucille 's if you 've ever had the opportunity to eat good southern bbq . this most definitely isn 't it .
american	supposed to start at 2 : 30 . didn 't get in till 3 : 00 . a hundred more behind us . bars not ready at half hour . # toms urban disaster .
american	do not eat here : 1 ) signs of old bread 2 ) when the bread is falling apart 3 ) they tried to toast the old bread so you wouldn 't notice or taste the difference 4 ) found a small bug on outside of bread we will never be backkkkk , our first and last timeeeeeee
american	don 't expect anything more . options are limited , prices are high , and food is mediocre . if you 're looking for anything more than that , look elsewhere . it 's obvious that the hotel management has decided to invest its money in other parts of the facility . of the many places we visited within the hotel , this was the only true disappointment . biggest let-down was the weak , watered down , overpriced coffee . not recommended .
american	some tvs for the sports fans . expensive , so recommend visiting during ' happy hour ' and just order from the limited appetizer menu . learned the hard way that this restaurant does not accept meal credits given by the resort .
american	waited 30 min for a falafel sandwich and chicken kebab platter . chicken was undercooked probably because others after us were complaining about the wait . one customer got her sandwich and waited 15 extra min for fries . if you can 't get the food out it 's going to be hard to expect repeat customers .
american	an apology and a refund was offered , however the manager on duty " ms anderson " was very rude when she saw that we were posting this . i think the worst part was as we we 're leaving a " chef " came running up with a rubber glove and said " look this isn 't even one of our gloves , this must have come from the proceeding plant . " so this thing went from the processing plant to the hotel buffet , cooked / reheated , then presented for serving and nobody noticed ? we are glad we didn 't find the piece of finger that was probably in the glove end !
american	great steak sounded inviting enough . it could not be further from great at all . cheese steak was way over salted to compensate for the lack of flavor i 'm assuming . we had the original philly and great steak . both tasted off and just horrible . i don 't leave many reviews but this was so bad 8 had too . price was 14 bucks for the sandwich and oversized regular fries . fries were soggy and too much for one person to even eat . maybe if they were worth eating i could 've eaten half of them . the only good thing was the ketchup packets to give this crud some sort of way to mask the horrible taste .
american	this place charges $ 87 for a lobster tail and $ 13 for a side of fries . they should be grateful for their employees and their hard work and they can afford to pay them more then minimum wage without asking for it from the customers . i don 't respect any place that pays their salt and vinegar french fries more than their employees , i don 't care how good the food is .
american	waited long time to be served the salad with the blue cheese or utensils . there were no refills on beverages and a filthy bathroom with overflowing garbage . it is so obvious that the employees and management just don 't care .
american	what a dive , i booked my staff there trying to save some money for the year for a convention last week . i love the location , just 5 minutes from the mandalay bay convention center , but what a sacrifice of quality . the minute you walk into the casino , it reaks of smoke and seems to be an attractions for what seems like the homeless . we parked in the back and left via poolside as much as possible . the rooms were corny and cheap , but clean and surprisingly quite . the girls dealing were really not all that good looking , just silicone filled . this place was pretty much a big disappointment .
american	ran out of food on fathers day .... really . place looks great but poor management . hope my next visit is better than this . no excuse !
american	smoked salmon on dark rye but wait ! it comes with hair from the kitchen & certainly not my dad 's ! ! ! server apologized no sign of a manager anywhere . pretty upset . do not recommend it here . the decor was my highlight .
american	we both had pork chops . one was dark and juicy , the other was white and bone dry . the bread was just ok , but the olive oil was bitter . the roasted beet salad was very good .
american	the onion rings i ordered were kinda overcooked and a little tasteless . my chicken strips and fries came out nice and hot which i liked but still the lack of taste made me wish i just went to mcdonalds to eat
american	from the beginning the staff was arrogant and unwelcoming . the salmon was cooked well , however the vegetables were ice cold . my steak was tough and unseasoned . having eaten at 3 of the top 5 steak houses in america , i was expecting more . worse yet , never was asked how the meal was by any staff . never told thanks for coming , even upon leaving . the valet guy did ask about our experience . we said thanks for asking and shared that my steak had run the 5th race at aqueduct . porter 's house has a very high opinion of themselves . in texas they would say all hat , no cattle .
american	at the risk of getting killed by everybody else who gave mickies 4 or 5 stars i just don 't think the breakfast here is a ) worth the wait b ) all that good or special c ) i haven 't had many meals here that didn 't go right through me go to original house of pancakes instead .
american	i had great service , but my steak just didn 't seem to be at the quality it should be to justify the price . if you truly want a high end steak house then keep looking .
american	a / c was out so it was a little muggy . service was pretty good . i ordered the rib eye 20oz. medium rare . it was on the lean side but pretty good . the only thing that was disappointing was the wine list . the first cab we selected was a 2007 and they brought out a 2008 . if we didn 't catch it they wouldn 't of said anything . we continued through the wine list and found at least 5 other bottles that had the incorrect year printed on the list . this combined with the broken a / c was almost a dealbreaker for our group . pretty sad in my view .
american	i had the southwest chicken sandwich , and my son had the macaroni and cheese burger .
american	my teammates and i were talking to each other about how we did not get our freckled lemonades in the special cup . she proceeded to walk up to our table and said with attitude , " are you sad you didn 't get it in a special cup ? " i believe this attitude she gave us was disrespectful and should be addressed . but i give the waiter shannon 10 stars he had amazing service and was very kind
american	we 've been sitting her for almost 1.5 hours waiting on our food ! i just cant understand why . im asking to speak to management . service this slow only leads to a snowball effect of extremely long wait times for a table . if i wasnt starving i would just walk out !
american	place looks like a total dive . we had tried the location at 59th ave and 101 and it was really nice , don 't know why they closed it down and kept this location open instead . we had a 5 : 30 reservation and the hostess asked if i had another shirt , needless to say we were happy to go elsewhere .
american	i used to eat here semi-regularly 3-4 years ago . went again this trip after having not gone in a while . service was good , but everything i had was bland and overcooked ... had to eat extra desserts and bread just to get full as the meat was inedible ( even the freshly carved prime rib . the freshly carved pork was ok . ) kind of sad . i will miss this place .
american	sat at a booth next to a very dirty wall . ordered shrimp cocktail which was served with 6 shrimp on a very hot plate . obviously just out of the dish machine . yuk . salad was ok . salad appearance did not pop , could have made it look good with 15 seconds of attention . dinner was flounder and broccoli . it was good . service was fine . could have been a much better meal with attention to detail and pride in their work .
american	a turd between two buns with over sweaty onions and the worst cheese on earth american mmmmm enjoy ppl .
american	no rhyme or reason to seating .... even taking into account parties of 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 or six .... certainly not first come . i ordered the chicken fried steak and the steak crust was cold and doughy . once the coating was removed it was edible . the potatoes looked good but were also lukewarm and soggy . my wife 's potatoes weren 't cooked on the inside .
american	you would think being in vegas it would be lively & more impressive . the gift shop was out of both items we were looking for . i probably won 't visit again ... been there done that .
american	full of drunks looking for greasy food at night . filthy dirty inside . soda machines are all out of carbonation . my wife had to wipe the seats and table herself before we sat . she even put down a layer of napkins before sitting . to top it all off something is dripping out of the ceiling . i gave it two stars because it 's exactly as i imagined it from the outside view and it 's cheap . plus the grease is a great remedy for a twisted tummy after a long hard night of drinking .
american	if you are looking for simple eggs , omelettes or scrambles , this is not the place . perfect for the avocado toast crowd-but be prepared to spend $ 15 for the plate . food was good , but certainly not worth the price . also very loud , not good for conversation at all . the noise of dishes and plates reminded me of a noisy cafeteria . i would not return . several places in the area offering much better atmosphere and value . fine dining sort of decor , ! which must be why breakfast for two was $ 50 . yikes !
american	augies sucks effen nasty ... white nachos how bout no ... pretzel burger how bout eff no 10000 thumbs down . !
american	my entrée was a pulled pork sandwich and it was uneatable . the top bum was burnt . it was called to the attention of a waiter and they said they would call it to the attention of the cook staff . that was it . someone is not paying much attention in the kitchen . repeat business , i don 't think so .
american	we were sat and waited 15 mins . kept making eye contact with our sever & he kept running off ! to top it off , they seated a part of 5 after we had been waiting 10-15 minutes and he immediately went to them ! ! i like the food here but we walked out on him & didn 't order anything ... feel like never coming back after austin 's horrible customer service & serving skills !
american	the only thing good about this location are the hostesses ! save your money and time .
american	tastes good enough , but not mind blowing . shared a pizza and two pasta dishes . could tell the ingredients were good , but just didn 't shine through for some reason . didn 't feel this was a good value for the prices charged .
american	don 't waste your money or time . incidentally , i am an avid gamer and used to just love this place . it saddens me that it 's fallen into such hard times .
american	50 / 50 waffle fries idea is really cool but they need better signature bowls .
american	had the chicken and cheddar which was ... average . too many sub options downtown to go back .
american	you can easily find any other place that serves burgers of this quality . patty was dry and bland . toppings for the burgers were boring and uninspiring . i was expecting more from a gordon ramsay joint but this was really quite disappointing . service was mediocre . asked for a new set of cutlery and the waiter forgot . asked for bacon with my burger and either the waiter forgot to write it down or he kitchen overlooked . i wouldn 't recommend this to anyone .
american	not to be chosen if your looking for a great culinary experience . think upscale chain style restaurant . lacks personality or personal care , a business lacking soul . the decor is uninspired trendy and suburban .
american	the burgers lack flavor , and despite the ' local ' appeal ( local is overdone and becoming a tag line that skeptics are teeing off on- yep , local is great and kudos to those who do it well ) . brgr / sorry , you food was once great . it 's now average at best . the burgers were dry and below average . the fries were average . the service was good which brings the overall visit to average .
american	agree with prior review that staff seemed annoyed i was there . order a buffalo chicken panini , but no buffalo favor . bread was soggy and blue cheese that came with it was in a packet with it was not homemade . very disappointed compare to café i / o
american	average at best. breakfast was bland. service a bit sloppy.not a good breakfast place .
american	sandwich i had was disgusting . girl at register was high .
american	have been wanting to try for some time , stopped in a little after 2 : 00 pm for lunch . dining room was clean with 4 tables of customers eating . greeting from the wait staff was cold . waited over 20 mins for the cheeseburger and mac and cheese that i ordered . mac and cheese was bland , with very little cheese flavor . cheeseburger was surprisingly small in size , only slightly larger than a mcdonald 's or burger king burger . appeared to be a frozen patty and no real flavor .
american	have eaten here 3 times over past year and a half and have yet to be satisfied . we arrived around 5pm and were greeted with a friendly hello from the bartender and the hostess . however , our waitress seemed to care less that we were there . i ordered the prime rib sandwich and substituted the wedding soup for the fries . soup was good , but the size was small and not worth the additional $ 1.99 . the sandwich was tasty , but small . my wife ordered the reuben , which was a good size but had very little flavor .
american	ignored all the reviews and decided to give it a shot . the food was decent . the muscles appetizer was good as was the tiger shrimp pasta . the main problem was the disinterested staff . no one really cared . the dining room set up left something to be desired as well . we sat at a small table facing the kitchen and the kitchen staff who looked like they were bothered at any request . take it from someone who took a shot , try it if you have a coupon , but don 't get your hopes up .
american	i had the lobster pasta which was drowning in sauce ; more like soup with pasta and lobster thrown in . prices are ridiculously high for food that is not that special . many other better places to eat in downtown summerlin so just go here for drinks and eat somewhere else .
american	i had the philly steak and chicken and waffles . the chicken and waffles were way too sweet and the philly steak was just gross . the homemade ice tea was alright . i wouldn 't go back .
american	i know vegas is expensive but $ 9 for a cheeseburger that has america cheese . nit eve cheddar or something with some flavor . onion rings are hand battered but bland . you need sauce to add flavor to everything . sweet potatoes fries were fine but nothing extraordinary . for the strip there are a lot of better options .
american	it is another applebee 's or champps . more chain junk .
american	it is very expensive for what you get . the bbq tastes ok but i can get ok bbq for a lot less elsewhere . the collards and potatoes were super spicy so my kids couldn 't eat it . our waitress was very grouchy and seriously didn " t get a smile out of any of the staff . they could use a good lesson in customer service !
american	nice decor , but our server was unattentive and lacked personality . we were expecting the salad bar to be included with our entrees , but nope , 2.99 extra ! really ? ? that was for a subpar salad bar at best . and get this , the saturday night prime rib " special " is the same cost as any other night . to be fair , the meat was tasty , but seemed small for $ 24.00 with no included salad bar . for $ 18.99 , the salad bar certainly should have been included with five pieces of shrimp and a baked potato . can 't justify going back ....
american	ordered the eggs benny . the eggs were perfectly cooked and the hash browns were nice and crispy , but the english muffins tasted kind of stale . it would have been nice if the waitstaff smiled . every single employee there seemed like they hated their life . a friendlier experience with the employees would have increased the rating . not a fan of grumpy people .
american	sarah h and i came after riding with big appetites and decided to split the vegan chorizo burrito , berry pancakes and a side of jalapeño cornbread . the burrito was great but everything else lacked . the sweet potato hash that came with the burrito was raw and crunchy . the pancakes were ok but tasted like they came out of a box at best . it was edible but not somewhere we will be back to .
american	stay home and make your food instead . atmosphere is blah , food is blah , coffee is blah and it was hot in the restaurant . won 't be back .
american	unseasoned burger dry overpriced overrated shulda went to mcdonalds ... honestly the amount of people who love this place makes me emotionally disturbed . if you have ever had a sirloin burger you would know what 4-5 stars tastes like . 16 $ for an average burger , fries that seem like someone barfed chilli on it and a canned drink ? thank you for wasting my time . edited to 2 stars : they forgot to give me my cookies .
american	way over priced for the quality . i got the cup o bread with my breakfast , over baked then over microwaved tough and chewy .... yet crunchy and dry on part ! had the ham steak and eggs , eggs were fine , ham was ok . hashbrowns were cold and over cooked , and the green onion in them were burnt black . coffee and breakfast with tax was $ 17.43 for one . and that was with the regular coffee . the french press coffee is almost $ 6 for 3 refills . probably won 't be back .
american	went here because the lines at the deli were endless and i can skip the line downstairs with my mlife noir card . in any way the buffet was comped from the casino side . it was breakfast time and even though i have seen plenty of breakfast buffets in vegas before this was one of the worst . not horrible but very average and depending on where you are sitting you have to walk endlessly to your table . not a comfortable environment either , it feels like a giant mess hall . can not recommend it , not even for free .
american	average . average . ordered the swiss mushroom burger ... it was so overcooked , almost dry . nothing dripped onto my plate . others that experienced the same thing were not wrong . mcdonald 's serves a better tasting burger . the location however is perfect , great fast food environment . burger 's priest is the benchmark . ub doesn 't even come close .
american	the wait staff was comprised of young kids that didn 't seem that concerned with delivering good service . the jalapeno poppers were disgraceful . my burger was adequate while my wife 's salad was pathetic .
american	my parents raved about this place from when they were regulars years ago , but needless to say when i have a hoagie & decent beer craving , i 'll be going elsewhere .
american	better places uptown and much better places outside of uptown . not a place i plan to visit again .
american	have to admit it 's kind of going down hill . they really need to change there food selections or they will lose more customers ... too bad cuz it 's a cool casino to stay and play .
american	their cheese curds sounded amazing on paper , but were very disappointing . bad cheese curds in wisconsin is kind of impressive . also , they seem to advertise their root beer / cream soda / ginger ale as though it 's house made , but they were all watered down and void of any real flavor . our server mentioned the sodas are from a mix . decent service at least .
american	could have made this meal at home . cali benny was requested as over medium and was extremely over hard . waiter did not seem to care about table . french toast and pancake were both doughy . fried egg was the size of a golf ball
american	bizarre that there 's no wait staff , so you pick up your own food and drinks . surprised you don 't have to bust your own table . seems like the business model for the place is how can we make the most about of money with little effort . come here if the better breakfast places are over crowded .
american	i think the egg dishes are more unique than ihop etc , but nothing really special . usually the servers are really nice , but there was one that made unnecessary comments on what my friend ordered .
american	the name said it all every plate contains egg in some form . i 'm not a big fan of eggs , i know crazy , why did i come to this place . well it was a group decision , apparently i didn 't win .
american	poor and crowded buffet layout . for the price ? ha . you 're better off heading down the street to denny 's .
american	i ate at 4 : 00 pm and a lot of the food was dried out or showed signs of having sat for a long time . i had a 2 for 1 coupon so two buffets for $ 40 seemed fair . if i had paid the full $ 40 each i would have felt ripped off
american	you know what you 're getting when you come to one of these : quantity over quality . like most vegas buffets , it is grossly overpriced . if you stay at the casino , you 'll get a 2 for 1 voucher though . vegetables don 't live here . on the plus side , they do have a made-to-order egg station , yay !
american	had breakfast here . service was a little slow had to wait a while to get a refill on my orange juice . had a bunch of bacon and scrambled eggs but they have a large selection . lighting is too dim , place needs to be brightened up ! ate here because it 's part of the buffet of buffets . but not worth the price on its own
american	because my mother is a platinum member through total rewards , we had the steamed crab , which was good . main issue is that the service was slow . a lot of tables were not cleaned off in a timely manner . ok buffet , but much better options available .
american	anyone who thinks this is good food has no credibility when it comes to food . if you want cheap cheese , bland meat , and a lot of grease and want to pay too much this is the place . i go to columbus oh for work , graffiti burger is the place over there . they have a big sign over the five guys in columbus . i passed by the five guys , almost empty , go to graffiti , packed . there is a reason for that , they serve the best burgers around . i so wish az had a place like that . until that happens , i am in search for the best burger in az .
american	good beer choices . service people have good intentions , no exprience . my burgee was punched in as a different item ( ext $ 4 ) and i never received the last beer order . waited 15 min . didnt wanna argue over the bill . ( last beer wasnt charged just never received ) when the weather is nice , patio is worth it .
american	as one person who walked by me commented , " definitely a college bar . " the place appears to be popular for birthdays . we went as a large group of around 13 people and were served by two waitresses however we waited for over 45 minutes for our meals and they still forgot one of our orders . but they managed to get the order out in 5 minutes at the most which makes me wonder why our orders took so long , especially since half the group was served before the other . it 's an okay place with a good price on their food but nothing special so i probably won 't be back again .
american	definitely had better . the buns are way too buttered up . the fries are somewhat dry . we also had the chili cheese fries , they were okay . onion rings were overly crispy . finally ended with the cookies and cream milkshake , which was standard .
american	no atmosphere . some one said let 's make it cheap and over charge for the food . bam . we have a business plan . cold beer and cheeseburgers is now a short drive away for a good burger . or four peaks has a burger for less price too many options in no scottsdale for this place . burger did not settle well for a friend and i ... too greasy ? too buttery ? whatever not good to be i 'll the next day
american	there are much better options in the area , if that 's what you fancy . asked about their pizza and was told the oven wasn 't hot enough . kids pizza was a pita covered in sauce and cheese . very disappointing .
american	average chain ... really nice outdoor area - really average food .
american	staff courteous and helpful . chicken was tender but i didnt like the coating . over salted but what fried chicken isn 't .
american	average diner food in an bland decorated building connected to a beer distributor .
american	not very big portions . foods average . the server was fine .. nothing special about this place at all ! they do make their own doughnuts but i didn 't even want to try them because the place is so over priced . the food was fine but like honestly we hardly got any home fries or toast .. the cappuccino was ok .. nothing great .
american	food : i ordered the reuben , which turned out to be quite salty . i ordered it to-go and , unfortunately , didn 't discover until i got home that they forgot the thousand island dressing . cost : reasonable . service : the staff were cheerful . the food didn 't arrive particularly quickly , but it wasn 't an annoyingly long time , either . atmosphere : eh , a bit cramped feeling . a bit like cracker barrel but squeezed into what felt like a smaller space . overall : it comes back to the food . i 'll give kneaders another try , but this time i wasn 't impressed .
american	average fare , and the service was a bit slow ... ordered the green salade from the table d 'hote it was very good ... but in all not really as good as it sounded from the reviews .
american	the only thing i liked was the outdoor patio that looked out to the strip and the space heaters to keep us toasty during the winter months . i 'm not a fan of the service though . it seemed like the waitress was bitching at all her customers and basically encouraging them to leave . i 'd come back for food or drinks but hopefully on a day that service is better .
american	three ribs a bit dry and tough plus an out of the bag garden salad with a 12 oz. soda alone , ran me 14 bucks !
american	we had breakfast here since we stayed at luxor . would i go back here ? maybe ... i wasn 't impressed . the cakes looked really good though ...
american	food servers not so inviting and always took a while to get their attention even when trying to pay the bill . 1st time i ate dinner at the bar , the bartender was absolutely rude to my boyfriend when he asked about military discount . bartender said why should we honor that ( sarcasticaly ) . my boyfriend was so mad he didn 't order a thing and was really offended . thought i 'd try again with my best friend , food was average , small portion again and the clam linguine was very bland . not sure i 'd go back , as i tried twice .
american	my waiter , in describing the night 's special , told me the wrong price , sides , and how the dish was prepared . honestly what i received was completely different from what he described . when i told him this he shrugged and said he doesn 't usually work there . wow . the food was really average ... salad had a smoky taste that i 'm still trying to figure out . the wine was also a different year than advertised on the menu . basically these people don 't seem to understand anything about how to run a restaurants , i.e. actually describe what food your customers will receive . please avoid , you can do better !
american	average food at best ... service poor from margret ( ? ) ... didn 't know the menu ... took 13 minutes before we stood up and went to the front and paid at which point she walked out the front door to get a vacuum out of someone 's car ... a lot of hype ... not worth the trip ... # dennyshasfrozenbuscuitstoo
american	wings undercooked and greasy . onion rings underwhelming . service poor . waited 30 minutes when place wasn 't busy ... won 't be back ...
american	average location . average drink options . " regulars " are somewhat obnoxious and the staff seems to focus on them vs. those that are first timers . original kenilworth is waaaaaaay better .
american	overall , if you have people who don 't want to try something good i guess you can go to this big box chain restaurant which i hope is among a dying breed . don 't know why you have to eat here in vegas .
american	average food , bad service ... sweet potato tots are ok but didn 't live up to all the hype .
american	one of our group asked for the veal dish to be prepared marsala , but the kitchen refused , citing some ridiculous , irrational reason . i like patronizing places where " the customer is always right , " not this place where " the customer is always wrong . " this is but one of numerous restaurants which exist only because it is located in a hotel and is located in an area with several better ones . do your self a favor a drive a few miles and you won 't regret it .
american	cheese curds were like an archaeological dig through the breading to find the cheese . i guess bread is cheap and cheese is expensive , but cheese curds are supposed to be all about the cheese ! prices are a little on the high side . house brewed beer was nothing special . i do not understand why people love this place so much .
american	three pancakes , 2 eggs and 2 pieces of bacon for $ 11 . the pancakes , biscuits and gravy are all average at best . wouldn 't recommend with so many other options in the vicinity .
american	ordered chilaquiles and funky monkey french toast . the french toast was very greasy and disappointing did not have a flavor of peanut butter at all as it suggested in the menu , it also did not have candy bananas as it suggested in the menu . chilaquiles were not very flavorful . at 1 : 20 pm two customers arrived and were turned away , because they were closing early although there was no sign indicating that . the server could not answer questions about items on the menu . interesting set up and decent location but will definitely not return .
american	nothing to brag about . it did manage to give me an upset stomach . the food is just ok and the deserts are not that great .
american	the duck and the shrimp were the highlights for me . the button mushrooms were good and the salad bar was a salad bar . nothing spectacular to warrant the high price . the servers were friendly and attentive , but why are all these places so dark ? my girl loved it , but she has rather simple tastes . sorry honey .
american	everyone seemed angry , from the 14 year old bus boys to the adult management . overheard several arguments and generally felt uncomfortable . we 've dined all over cleveland but i won 't be returning here - too many better options .
american	was dining with a friend with food allergies and realized the chef is too full of himself to care . if you need something off the menu , find somewhere else to go .
american	inhospitable hostess . we were expecting outstanding food based on other people 's recommendations . first person we see ( hostess ) is extremely rude ! i will point out our waitress was really nice and provided good service ( hence the 2 stars ) . the food was so blah , that i wouldn 't recommend this place . there are so so many other great breakfast places close o this area .
american	lackluster in taste . just like most buffet everything over salted . dessert was below average . nice decor though . by the way , got cold coffee .
american	the gal that brought us our food didn 't even care ( or so it seems ) . bad management ! get a grip and you just might make it .
american	the outdoor area was the only reason i we stopped and that was nice . my fish and chips were slightly above but everything else was meh . the " ice tea " was instant and the soup was ok . your probably going to get an ok meal here but for the price you have better options .
american	avoid the $ 3.00 new horrible tasting healthy soda . one star for being able to sit outside .
american	pay $ 80 for thanksgiving dinner . no king crab , no macaroon , sub par oysters . i am disappointed .
american	reuben potatoes were lukewarm . beer was foaming over top of bottle when waitress brought drinks to table . won 't be back .
american	in town for vacation and spent 1.5 hours of my day stuck in this place because the wait staff were so terrible . waited over a half hour to get my check and then even longer to pay after that .
american	this place ( the location , the actual building itself , etc . ) could be so much more . i wish they would either step it up , or sell the business to someone that would let it achieve its true potential . until then , there are other dining options in regent square and they should be explored .
american	sorry i can 't give a better rating . service was excellent . waitress was friendly . all other open kitchen staff coming and going never acknowledged the customers . sandwich had wilted , nearly slimy lettuce . meat was lean but bland . the person that made the sandwich knows exactly how unfresh the sandwich content was .
american	terrible service in the restaurant : unpleasant older lady . they charged us for freaking bread before our meal that took 1hour to get here . never going back : (
american	go here if nicely cut up under ripe fruit is what you crave . terrible value for your money and the fact that there is line ups every weekend makes no sense at all . go to fran 's down the street for better bang for your buck . service is good doe
american	waitstaff was very average at best . either overwhelmed or uninterested , but just didnt leave a reason for a return visit . food was decent , just nothing to honestly write home about . hot wings heavy with vinegar , blue shroom burger came out medium well even though requested medium rare . very dry . the maui maui sandwich was good , just a very small portion . give it a try , maybe you will do better than we did ...
american	the loaded cheese fries were not very loaded ... many fries were just fries . the fish tacos were ok but were a bit dry and could have used some more of a sauce . the sweet potato fries were good because of the whipped butter they served them with . i was disappointed with the beer selection . with an ale house you would think they might have a better craft selection but it was very average . service was ok , the waitress was nice enough but seemed a bit flighty . prices were ok , but the quality of food was not great so i would not make a special trip here .
american	too loud and chaotic , you can 't hear yourself think it is so loud . waitress never checked on us . not a business i will revisit or recommend .
american	my friend said great , then good food . i still think average . other friends says eh food . i think servers weren 't here today ? soup was good . drinks came at the end of the meal . yes , the end . i wouldn 't return . we all ate gyros . average .
american	average food with a pretentiously high price tag for lunch .
american	if you 're out of creamer , you should probably tell your patrons before they purchase a coffee . won 't be returning .
american	no signature dishes or flare in cooking . just a regular dinner . i can make better food at home . if u charge money then u should provide better food . vegas just charges more for what you get back home .
american	got to this buffet about 8pm and everything was already cold and hard . definitely not worth $ 30 . not much of a selection food or drink wise .
american	service was less than stellar . took over 45 minutes just for appetizers ! noise level it 's excessively high .
american	i had the arizona omelette and it was smothered a little too much , couldn 't even taste the omelette . the potatoes tasted like something you could buy at a hospital cafeteria . the coffee was hot and decent . there is nothing special about this place and would rather have home-cooked and tasty , unique food than a bright atmosphere with a trendy name .
american	large salads but they 're mostly lettuce . the gyro was nothing to rave about and was mostly onions and lettuce . the pizza is mediocre and needs more flavor . the service is frequently slow . it has a lot of potential as your local pizza spot but it just falls short . as far as flavor the fast food pizza places are just as good .
american	sandwich tasted great , sweet potato fries were soggy , and it took over 15 minutes to get my order . the owner was yelling at an employee who called in sick and sent another to retrieve bottles of diet coke as his fountain was down . it felt disorganized despite it being slow and four employees were running around . under new management / ownership the concept is a good one . until that happens , i 'll pass .
american	i went for dinner , not drinks , and the food was unimpressive . the bloody mary was served with a slim jim straw , which was different to say the least . it seems this place is all about image , but not about substance .
american	just average . not bad , not good . family friendly . right across from major shopping .
american	i wasnt too impressed with the customer service . now , i wont slander the business due to a garbage employee but , i was unimpressed nonetheless . its kind of too basic , nothing to catch your eye , no theme or anything that says , ' come back ! ' ... so , i probably will not ...
american	ordered prints on two different occasions and they " forgot " to trim them leaving about a one inch white strip along one side . tech said " it 's no big deal , i 'll just trim them . " uh , yeah it kinda is a big deal for me having to make another trip back because you were too busy texting one of your idiot friends to do your job .
american	our waitress seemed as if she was just going through the motions , and it was like we were an inconvenience to her at work . and usually while leaving any restaurant the host / hostess will have a parting remark , but he was too busy attempting to be artistic .
american	nothing special . we went at 7 : 30 on friday night and the place was empty . no real atmosphere . the service was prompt , but lacked the polish i would hope for from a host and waitstaff . food was ok . bread and dip was really good . salad was plain jane , lettuce , cucumber and tomato . my wife had the chocolate cake for dessert which was good . won 't be back anytime soon .
american	living in oakmont we were excited to see a gyro shop moving into verona , but quickly were disappointed . we 've ordered from there 4 times now . the gyro meat is the same as everywhere , except acropolis slices it and keeps it in a warmer ( who does that ? ) . better to slice it fresh , as needed , or at least throw it on the flat top before assembling the gyro . the sauce is ok . the service is mediocre . first time we went we ate in and my lamb platter arrived late . each time we 've been there the serving size was different .
american	nothing special about this buffet expect the people who figured out to buy the " all you can drink " option and get good and drunk before heading to the pool for the day ! pretty smart way to get a much cheaper buzz ! honestly , nothing really stood out as above average on this buffet , except maybe the salad bar . that was decent . i would hate to come here in a group ( 5 or more ) because they automatically add 18 % gratuity to your bill . i don 't mind tipping , usually over 18 % , but for a buffet where you fill your own drinks ? ? it 's kind of crazy .
american	nerves of steel for sure lol plenty of better options out there for med food just look on yelp .... also if your vegieterrian good luck , litle to no options ... lower you prices and improve your quality tasty kabob med food is not a novelty anymore like back in the 80 ' .
american	the eggs were good and so were the pancakes . i would have loved to try the grits but they had none . nothing to write home about - guess i am spoiled because we have stellar breakfast joints in suburban chicago .
american	gyro is good . fried items arrive a little on the cold and soggy side .
american	average pizza and the interior was a bit on the dirty side for my liking
american	but with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni . i 'll walk across the street next time .
american	i put several napkins over my two slices to mop up the grease . the worst thing about this place is the manager . he has a lousy attitude , and is quite rude . i don 't think i 'll ever go back .
american	the spinach was not fresh and our waitress was horrible . she kept getting our drink orders wrong and had to ask for knives two times before getting them . she was not very friendly or accomodating , and it took her 15 minutes to return our credit card when we paid . our table was never cleared off either .
american	the chains , which i 'm no fan of , beat this place easily . there were a lot of families here ... they must have cheap kids menu or something .
american	had the hawaiian bbq and hubby had the chicken wrap . not impressive at all . save your coins and go elsewhere .
american	service relatively quick . feels more like las vegas 's version of quizno 's . slightly better than fast food .
american	sub-par service . why on earth would someone want to talk to a rude employee only to then wait 10 minutes for a sandwich . if you ask me there are far better options in town .
american	the location seems to be built to serve a highly populated neighborhood . 3 order taking stations in the back and two serving lines . yet when i visited , there was no customers anyway . good sandwich . nothing special that the local shops can 't do . save a trip here and patronize the little local places that do it better .
american	the fruit on the breakfast bar was poor and not refilled . the bacon was very good . wouldn 't go here unless comped or 1 / 2 price .
american	i ordered a burger cooked medium , but it came horribly undercooked . my wife ordered a salad , and the lettuce was noticeably brown and wilted . really hard to believe they thought it was ok to let that bowl of brown , dead leaves out of the kitchen . the staff was friendly , and our server asked if he could bring us new meals but we didn 't have much faith that anything else would have been any better . we likely won 't be back .
american	bad food . i had eggs benedict and the english muffin was burnt so bad i almost could not saw through it with my knife . hollandaise was tasteless . i was surprised they would bring the food to me like this . there are many better options in the area . skip this one . on a side note : they seemed to not mind a customer having her dog in the outside eating area . i am a dog lover , but this is disgusting . your dog does not belong at a restaurant ! she should have been asked to leave .
american	way too long to prepare simple items like a sandwich or a salad . too expensive .
american	nothing special . not sure how much they pay the new times for being nominated as phx 's best slice , but i disagree . i will say the prices are good and the girl who works the counter is always nice . way better options out there , but if you are in a hurry and live close to this location ...
american	food tastes pre-cooked or frozen , meny is too large , service is great , and it 's breakfast all day .
american	only reason for 2 star is the crème brule . the other chocolate dessert is too dense ....
american	i ordered hot wings and a side of fries our waitress brought out fries a good ten minutes before my wings . that was annoying . my wife ordered a beef brisket sandwich of some sort . the thing had unannounced red peppers on it . my overall impression was slow and average . disappointing .
american	there are plenty of other mediocre places to go for food that appeals to the least common denominator , and it 's probably better to go to one that turn lunch around in less than an hour .
american	way overpriced for what you get . i went with 6 other people and not one person was impressed . i 'd take a five guys or even red robin over this place any day .
american	we had high hopes about this place . we don 't mind spending lots of money on a fabulous meal and have done so many times but ... save your money and go to another fine dining restaurant in vegas as there are plenty to choose from . prime rib is basically moved around the room in a covered warming bin ! mashed potatoes were runny . our waitress , mrs. bender was delightful and the highlight of our meal ! prime rib again , average .
american	everything was just .... ok . the fries tasted sweet for some reason which i 'm not the greatest fan of . ordered delivery of the 30 boneless wing family pack , tried lemon pepper , bbq , original hot . also , ordered baked beans , potato salad & cole slaw . overall , i 'd give it a 5 out of 10 .
american	in my opinion there are much better places for a burger , but if you are in the area and really want a burger then you could go here .
american	it 's old and outdated . everything is kept warm with heat lamps . the crab legs for dinner were probably made a few days ago ... just terrible . le village isn 't worth a penny over $ 10 . trust me , go somewhere else . bacchanal at caesars costs way more , but it 's way better .
american	the only good thing was the service but the place had a bad smell , the food was not good also . we had two burgers and it was just disgusting . we ate most of it because thats how hungry we were but really can 't believe how well rated this place is . don 't spend your time and money coming here . there are waaay better restaurants in vegas .
american	we arrived around noon and asked if we can order breakfast . they said the breakfast was only served before 11am ( ? ) but i can order the them from their " all day breakfast menu . " what and why is that ? i ordered something from the all day breakfast menu ( name begin with " las vegas " something ... couldn 't remember clearly ) . it said this dish comes with " sausages " while it only came with scrambled eggs with spinach and " ground pork . " i really think by paying around $ 15 you should get at least three " sausage links . " such a rip-off . now i understand why people go to denny 's .
american	what the hell is green beans w / spaghetti anyways
american	the food tasted pretty good ... but not a good value at all . for fifteen dollars i got a tiny sandwich ( but delicious ) and a very average tomato salad . everything did taste fresh , but it felt a bit boring and they didn 't pay as much attention to detail as i would 've liked . the waitress was not friendly at all . i tried their gazpacho on a different occasion and it was delicious , but they got rid of the combos , which i really don 't like .
american	even though they comp 'd me for all day buffet , i ate here once and that was it ..... nothing really special , the desert bar is small , salad bar small ... and the hot foods were dry and not tasty at all . i ended up making a salad , ate some fruit , had a glass of orange juice and left very unsatisfied
american	i update my previous review since twice i have had bad experience with this location . one time chicken on rocks given to me all cold . now when ask to put lettuce on top of chicken rocks they put it on one side . before they used to spread it . this has become like any other location of osmows - with bad customer service .
american	it was a busy night and while waiting the hostess and manager were letting people jump the line . after finally seating it took forever for the waiter to serve us . the food was really bad . the beef and pork was tough and overcooked , the rice was mushy and potatoes over cooked . we did complain to the waiter and he said a lot of people were complaining that night . there was no adjustment to the bill so i paid $ 19.00 for a greek salad ! would not return nor recommend this location .
american	i went there last night for dinner , and was very disappointed . the prices are high , the food is good , but not worth the money 2 people came to dinner , each had a pasta dish , no drinks , no appetizers and no desserts . the bill $ 35.00 . the pasta was not home made , and when the meals were served there was no fresh cheese . it was tasty but not worth that kind of money , and even 5 he tasted as store bought . ...
american	the service was good but the food was unimpressive . i had a chicken souvlaki on a pita with a salad . the chicken was very salty and had no other flavour . the salad was uninspired and bland . so was the taziki sauce . i went looking for great greek good and could have gotten better at a food court . disappointing . avoid .
american	service was subpar . i had high expectations after the high four stars reviews . it failed to deliver . my crab cakes appetizers were bland , and boring . i ordered the salmon main course with a request for a moist salmon . it was dry , and tasteless . i will not be a returning guest on future trips to charlotte .
american	when it reached us , a seemingly inexperienced server reached across guests , did not return with answers to questions asked , and gave us forks to eat creme brulee . when we asked for spoons , she returned with large , round soup spoons . the food was adequate , tho certainly nothing extraordinary . even the venue was so so with mismatched glassware , chairs and silverware .
american	not even a parting goodbye when leaving . server was decent but i have had better . the bread was fresh and the caesar salad was very good . the bolognese sauce was very bland and dry . reading the reviews on this location it sounds like it needs a management and staff overall .. and possibly positions higher than this . good luck !
american	my first time visiting and i think it 's too noisy for a library . i recommend a separate facility for the children . the younger children should have a separate place ( a children 's library ) . this place sounds like a nursery or a playground or the lunchroom at school . i was rather disappointed . the sunset chandler library is much more peaceful and quiet if you do not like noise distractions .
american	our party of four ordered two cubano sandwiches , a beef panini and a club sandwich . there was very little meat in the cubano sandwiches , the panini was cold , the cheese not even melted . i sent it back asking that they put it back into the press for a little longer . when it was brought back it was obvious that they microwaved it resulting in rubbery bread . the server never asked how our meal was . they charged $ 21 to $ 23 for each of the sandwiches and fifty cents each for water . very disappointed !
american	we went for breakfast with our friend alan , who has been coming here for over 20 years . owned by the same family for nearly 60 years , the food and the atmosphere was very nice . we ate outside on the terrace which was landscaped beautifully with ivy and flowers . the service was terrible here . we had to ask twice for coffee refills , water , and even silverware . the wait staff seemed preoccupied . the menu was traditional french . i had a country dried ham baguette sandwich which was very nice . denis had the omelette . again the food was great , service lacking .
american	it was taking a few minutes to get around some people to seat six at a table / booth . he started pushing the table and swearing including the f word . very poor individual to represent a business . he wnded by yelling for us to get the f out .
american	the soups are just ok . you can tell the soups aren 't made fresh ( not that i was expecting them to be ) - they kind of taste like a processed mesh of blah blah blah . but , that 's what i expect from a corporate conglomerate that 's shipping in soups from a warehouse in plastic bags . blah soup . i ordered the crab bisque and a tuna salad wrap . the sandwhich was tasteless . definitely more wrap than substance . and what substance there was - had no taste . i won 't be going back to any zoup - anywhere .
american	i 've always loved pcg , but my service today was a little on the weak side , and my eggs benedict was very disappointing . the hollandaise was super thin and i could detect no taste to it at all . they no longer had the pork tenderloin benedict which is listed on their online menu , but without good hollandaise i doubt that would have been much of an improvement anyway . i think i will stick to dinner here in the future .
american	take a normal theater and add pricey , messy , and inefficient food service . the food has a very microwave feel to it , and while the floors aren 't sticky like in many theaters , the lack of cleaning between food services leaves a grimy feeling . this place was way better when it was mez but you can still get a drink during a movie which is nice . typical of charlotte , most people are taking up server time ordering water .
american	the food is another matter . i went for brunch with my stepdaughters on a quiet saturday . the place was mostly empty . service was attentive . our order took forever , though . when our food finally arrived , the omlettes were perfect . the eggs . benedict and the pancakes were not . both were cold . the eggs benedict went back to the kitchen twice : first to be dried-out under the broiler then to be microwaved . the pancakes were replaced . when one of us talked to the server , he actually said that eggs benedict " are supposed to be a little cold .. " come on ! no adjustment on the bill .
american	there is no ranch dressing or anything creamy . it is difficult to get help when using their kiosks . the shrimp are minuscule and taste like sulfites . croutons were soggy .
american	25 mn to be served . we are supposed to be in a fast food in an airport where people are in a hurry . the buyer , because yes for 12 $ you have just a burger , no fries or drink , came with cold , still frozen bread ! terrible
american	hostess is cashiering at the same time . no one is being seated even though there are tons of tables open . the manager buses table ... waiters chatting i the back . no one cares ....
american	first of all let me just say the food is absolutely horrible . it is probably on point with what is served in prisons and public schools . i went on seafood night and deeply regretted that decision the following morning . don 't eat here , the food isn 't safe . that 's all that needs to be said .
american	over charged for a buy one get one . super gross because they touched everything before touching my sandwich .
american	the dining experience couldn 't have gotten much worse , save a hair or bug in the food , here at steiner 's . from very mediocre food ( of course they ran out of their nightly special , as well ) to completely neglectful service ( yes , you , blond pony tail girl ! ) , this was completely unpleasant . decided to give our neighborhood steiner 's a try instead of the go-to , always reliable , always delicious , always friendly roadrunner . major mistake . steiner 's is crossed off the list . let me save you the trouble of finding out for yourself . : ( should have a 0-star option .
american	the staff is rude and ms piggy ( as another customer referred to her as ) refused to serve our kids dessert while we had a drink at the bar . if you go you will leave disappointed ! i 'm surprised they lasted a month let alone 100 years .
american	too bad there are no stars ! ! ! stopped here on 10 / 24 . pump malfunctioned , spilled gas all over husbands pants and shoes . told the clerk ... she did not care . husband asked for a bag to take off pants / shoes and put them in the bag in the back of my crossover ... car smelled so bad , that my daughter almost passed out . pulled over at rest area and threw the clothes / shoes out . called that stations operation manager named kim just now . she was rude , did not care and hung up on me !
american	worst experience ever ! ! ! place wasn 't even busy and we had to wait 10 minutes for a table of two . the service is terrible . our food came out cold , we had to remind the server to bring us bread and we had to ask them for salad ( which was part of the meal ) it was brought after the mains ... my mid rare lamb was well and the salads were rotting , too bad astoria was closed today otherwise i would have gone there
american	ordered corn beef hash . was greasy , flavorless and undercooked . they served it with a sauce that i can only describe and something like licking a grease trap . i nearly threw up . i was with two other people who ordered the " big stack " and a salad .. similar experiences . on top of all that , the wait staff was rude and lazy and refused to take the meals off our bill . i will never eat here again .
american	the delivery guy tried to rip us off 10 $ over the bill . they delivered 1h45 mins after the order . the poutines were served with igredients we didnt order . the pizza wasn 't even room temperature , it was cold .
american	this place is a disgrace to the spirit of chicago food . the worker bees and owners don 't give a f # % ^ about the customer experience . it 's obvious they use substandard condiments . vienna should yank their ability to purchase vienna products . there are many superior choices when you 're in the mood for true chicago fare with respect and appreciation . you 've been warned ! avoid ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
american	avoid ! avoid ! unless you like overpriced bland breakfast for $ 18 stay away and go somewhere nice ! check yelp before eating anywhere in nevada ! coffee is shit and the rancheros is fucking slop ! avoid !
american	bartenders and servers were doing shots in the kitchen . granted is was new year 's eve but only 3pm . slow service because of this . manager was the one carrying trays of shots back to the kitchen and then calling all the bartenders and servers to the kitchen . food was cold and not as described on the menu .
american	i stopped in here for lunch today and the cashier first yells at me for trying to serve my self some pita chips from the self serve salad bar . i said no problem and continued on with the other choices . thirty seconds later she yelled loudly that i was standing to close to the salad bar and then began to swear in spanish . as a successful business man i value great customer service and friendly staff . being screamed at by staff when your simply trying to catch a meal isn 't acceptable .
american	food good . service is beyond poor . sat at the table for 30 minutes to get food . 20 minutes to get check .
american	we were staying at the resort and had plans to enjoy the rest of the day at the resort pool / lazy river . we should of looked at the reviews first . the service was extremely poor - ice tea came to the table with no ice . water tasted terrible . we waited for at least 1 / 2 hour for our meals ( eggs , toast , oatmeal , ..... ) . we had to " snag " a busboy to get ice for our tea . avoid
american	horrible service . after being here for 15 minutes with no one even saying hi or stoping by or anything we left . no one cared we left . 1 star . plenty of better places .
american	they are the slowest and the busiest wal-mart in the world . i wonder if they realize those two things should not go together . sam walton is probably turning over in his casket .
american	highschool cafeteria food prep is better than what comes out from this lazy and obviously inexperienced kitchen staff . so much for the " must do " in pittsburgh ...
american	we ordered 3 things on the menu and all were disappointing . eat at shake shack around the corner instead .
american	order at the door is a solid warning , yet we ventured forth . mistake . had steaks priced as if we were at outback , yet they tasted as if they were previously frozen . salad bar was ok , as was the soup selection . here 's the kicker .. within a hour i was ill .. and it lasted for days . wifes steak , sirloin at that , was full of fat and grizzle . do yourself a favor , eat the dead raccon at the prior exit .
american	i have dined here many times but never again . the caesar salad is so small that i can not fill up on the large one as my meal since i choose it to be my entree . lettuce is so expensive that they can not give much in the pricey salad .. heh ! ! the crab cakes are burnt on the outside and raw and cold on the inside . i requested them to be cooked inside . bread is sad . there are sooo many other restaurants to select from . most of the patrons are way above 75 years old . looks like the nursing home bused them over here .
american	initially , the menu sounds appetizing , in the trend of the up and coming québécois nouvelle cuisine . oh were we disappointed . overpriced and poor quality . the portions are ridiculously small . the food is surprisingly low grade . the atmosphere is nice but really doesn 't offset the disappointments . this place almost qualifies as a scam . head down mt royal avenue , for more and better options .
american	what a terrible place . bad service . moody waiter and just bad food . the entrecote tasted old and on the turning point . uneatable . really bad experience . not even the french fries were done right .
american	it reminds me of a hometown buffet chain . the food is plentiful as is the selection , and some of the items are good . but the it comes off as a cheap cafeteria . it looks old and run down , and some of the food looks like its been sitting there forever .
american	as a matter of fact i would prefer the plague . minced cobb salad ? cole slaw cobb salad . the meatballs tasted horrible and the sauce was lacking as well .
american	tiny sandwich served on crunchy rye , not steamed . the bread was more like a cracker , not soft fresh bread . the pastrami was served cold . i guess i should have known better when the server asked if i wanted lettuce on my pastrami . the server was brand new and just did not know ... oh well i 'm sure the bagels are ok .
american	avoid ... line to order horrible , we waited forreevveerr ... and eventually went to wrap place across food court which had better service and same type of menu .
american	literally the worst thing i have eaten in years . threw away an entire pizza and wings it was so bad
american	when i got home with my order i realized i had the wrong biscuits . all of the complaints has not improved this operation , the owner / manager has to recognize all of the issues and take action ! i have been parked and waited 20 minutes , served cold coffee , got an egg mcmuffin with no egg , and ordered an egg and cheese and received a sausage biscuit instead . this place sucks !
american	my gastrointestinal system and i deeply regret those tasteless $ 1 oysters : ( also , my friend ordered a french 75 , the bartender had no clue what it was and , instead of admitting as much , looked it up in a book and ended up simply pouring champagne and gin into red wine glass , which was not really what we wanted ( to pay for ) . also when we asked for the check , we got the wrong person 's bill . sigh .
american	after 30 min. of back and forth , they finally refunded my money , and said they had not refunded my money immediately because i had mentioned i returned an ipad . actually the gift certificate clearly stated it was redeemable at any store , and the bar code would have given them all the info they needed . bad experience for entire process . if i had not insisted , they would have had the failed unit i returned and my money . walmart , you should treat your customers better .... otherwise , " sears . "
american	now i know why all of the positive reviews said great late night place . you need to have a drunken buzz to enjoy the food . we were 0 for 4 on dinners . bbq chicken pizza crust was burned and lacked flavor . the pulled pork was dried out , tough and lacked taste . buffalo mac n cheese was too thick tasted like they just dumped frank 's red hot sauce in . lastly , the jerk chicken was too jerky . waitress took our order and didn 't check on us or offer to get more drinks .
american	i love this place , however the online ordering is not quite there . i ordered a pepperoni pizza , they sent a half cheese half pep . i called to express my concern , mentioned i had an email receipt , they did nothing . i 'm happy to pay for half the pizza , but wish they would have credited half back to my card since it was their error . have screen shots and emails if anyone sees this and would like to fix the site .
american	ordered the manhattan steak . not a great cut but i was looking forward to the brandy peppercorn sauce . the sauce unfortunately was bland . the steak was cooked as ordered , but was surprisingly full of grissle - probably 30 % . service was weak . prompt upon seating and then disappeared . had to flag down another server to refresh our drinks when the plates hit the table . focus seems to be on turning tables rather than putting quality on the plates .
american	you just will be stared down with a dirty look like you want to take advantage of them or something when you showed them the rotten parts after consumed some ( didn 't realized you have to check all the parts of the sandwich before eating , guess my own fault ) . no apology or anything from him . very bad customer service from this place . not what i expect from chick-fil-a .
american	we went after the rush , still quite slow . the ohio pancake wasn 't very tasty . regular pancakes better , also a lot of money for 2 pancakes ( 10 bucks each ) .
american	portion size is an absolute joke . expect 1 / 2 of your sides and to be calling back asking who ate them on the way to your house .
american	the hostess was completely disoriented . she could care less . we sat at the table ( banquettes are too short ) for 10 min without any service . bartender served the table next to us twice . walked out and went to the staple of henderson , lucille 's .
american	mother had shrimp linguine , weird , plate was hot but food cool ? she sent it back , second time was ok but it was her birthday . i was so disappointed , they never brought her anything at all for her birthday . it wasn 't crowded . it will be a cold day in hell before i come back ! ! ! tawni f r server time bout 5 : 15 monday , red lobster at 7921 w bell ed
american	typical place to mess with a woman 's car . i would sue if i could . cost me 1200 to get it fixed
american	three scallops that when stacked are approximately the size of 1.25 ' normal ' scallops . willoughby isn 't new york city .
american	we had several enjoyable , high-quality breakfasts there but the dinner was atrocious .
american	they must hire family members to staff the bar . the pizza is amazing but the service at the bar is terrible . the bartender brit was rude to all the customers and when i caught her eye she rudely said " i 'll be right with you ! " i 've never had such bad service . still waiting for her 15 minutes after sitting down at the bar . finally walked next door for a beer while i wait for my pizza
american	service was extremely slow , though we arrived on a sunday at 11 : 30 and the place was far from packed . my grilled cheese was nothing to write home about . my coffee was below average . sad truth is everything looks and tastes better at your run-of-the-mill cora : (
american	avoid the buffet if you don 't want to feel heavy the whole day , little overpriced
american	we just spent over $ 70.00 for two people . we have eaten here before . it is not worth the money . strictly mediocre . it wasn 't actually bad . it just was not good . bland , uninteresting , dull food . it has gone down hill . better spend you money on a nice meal at a specialty restaurant , rather than a buffet with a lot of choices , none of which are worth buying .
american	burger like a frozen pre-made patty . not hot and bacon looks like food poisoning in a pink dress . one star for the fries being ok .
american	this is not a steakhouse . sent it back 2 times . came back soaked in salty gravy and just very upsetting for $ 30 .
american	i 've had both the veal sandwiches and panzerottis at different occasions and came up disappointed . the veal sandwiches was both pricey and dry , definitely undersauced . the panzerotti was too greasy , undersauced , and looked deformed . the grease was literally dripping in my car - seriously , could u not have provided a box instead of a paper bag ? wtff ! ? are the staff properly trained ? is a panzerotti supposed to look like that ? the franchises have imho ruined the brand 's reputation .
american	the new york steak is better than expected at $ 18 ... char grilled and it was very good . burger was average , most of the other food we ordered ( fish & chips , nachos with chili ) tasted like cafeteria food .
american	food came out overcooked and dry . waitress came back to inform us she was leaving dropped off the check and didn 't see another server no refills on drinks cashier looked disgusted .
american	these guys have yet to get my order right after 3 visits . nothing exciting either . hamburger with catsup . every time there 's something wrong . i 'll get a burger with everything , burger with mustard , chicken sandwich ... definition of durp . their receipts print the taunting statement of " concerns please call " and no number .
american	that $ 20 is exactly like everything else on the menu , too good to be true ! my wife and i got this and it turned it to be two chunks of meat , literally two chunks of meat on an onion ring ! overall , it was a very overpriced meal !
american	much more toppings at any other sub place i 've ever been to .
american	i used to frequent this place often , but over the past two years it 's become awful . i highly recommend going hungry should that be the only other option . the cheese is always dry , the chicken is always soggy , and the fries are freshly cold anytime of day . i 've even had terrible breakfast sandwiches here , which should be a crime . it 's not difficult to make a fast food experiences worse but the employees take the cake in that category . avoid if you value your stomach and have to have burger king , try the one at broadway and priest , the quality is worth the trip .
american	at first it looks like a nice little joint then you get your food and serve neither one were on point ! the food and service was terrible ! first the girl gave us a salad that was in the display cabinet and it sitting out all day and the lettuce was brown ! then they were out of the caesar dressing for the caesar salad ! then i ordered the cucumber sandwich and the bread was hard as a rock !
american	if you 'd actually like to eat and drink anything anytime soon , please go somewhere else . you 'll thank me later . the waiters stand around and play with one another and avoid eye contact with patrons . the manager included . do yourself a favor and find something else to eat . thanks for nothing dennys . shut it down and build a parking lot . jj was our waiter ... if you get jj as your waiter , get up and leave ! seriously ! !
american	garbage product , long wait , never open at 6am like the sign says it is . if it 's a straight cup of coffee that you 're looking for , headed down the hall to johnny rockets . you 'll find they have decent coffee at a decent price , and you get free refills , and there 's never a even a line .
american	its on st. clair just west of bathurst , south side . ) the rib tips were boiled and maybe grilled briefly over hickory but i say even that 's a stretch of the imagination . the sauce ( stockyards ! ) was pretty bland . pulled pork was bland , dry and smokeless . ice tea wasn 't even authentic homemade ( stockyards ! ) how far you 've fallen memphis style .
american	we should have eaten at denny 's right down the street . first thing in the morning , 6 am and the restaurant was filthy ! the breakfast was horrible , and the service was the worst i have ever seen . not that anyone reads yelp reviews for fast food , but seriously don 't go to this one ! ! the food will probably give me the runs
american	30 minutes to mess up an order of 1 burger and fries , nothing else . worst fatburger location this side of town . the employees are slow . the food is always cold . avoid this location and make the trek to red rock casino for a $ 1 extra for everything if you really need to have fatburger . done with this place . i would be firing the whole staff if i was in charge of this loss leader .
american	absolutely terrible . ordered the smoked platter , took over an hour to come to table and when it did it was cold and meat was dry . could not bring myself to eat , sent back . will never return .
american	let 's just say that waiting for 15 minutes for your reciep on an empty saturday night restaurant is a good enough reason not to go . plus below average food you have many other options in the area .
american	it 's always a 10minute wait every time i go in there . the $ 5 lunch combo is never ready either it 's ridiculous ! especially for people on there lunch breaks or trying to find a quick bite . as advertised hot n ready pizzas suppose to be ready at anytime and it never is , every time i 've gone in there people are walking out with discuss .. avoid
american	they are impatient , mess up orders , and are downright rude and unapologetic . while it is the only popeyes in within a walking distance from home - so i have given it plenty of chances - there are other junk food options around ! ! !
american	i recently went here and placed a big order . they managed to forget my 20 piece nugget , not the end of the world right ? called them when i noticed and they told me to come back in . when i arrived the cashiers swore up and down that they gave me my nuggets and basically called me a liar in the dining room . never thought that i would be publicly embarrassed over $ 5 of nuggets by $ 9 employees . corporate eventually sent me a voucher to use that this specific location . hoping they don 't claim it 's fake .
american	we love the hash house , have been to the original in san diego many times and always excellent , even the sahara ave one is decent . the hh in the quad hotel is a mess . the long wait is not the problem , you get that at hh on a weekend , it was the hour long wait for food after we ordered . somebody messed up but our sever and 2 other servers who filled our coffee and the manager that came by all told us it was normal wait time . it 's not normal , it 's a shame this location of hh is managed that way .
american	the fry on the fry holder are left there for awhile then mixed with the fry that barely came out of the fryer . please avoid this mcd this place is a horriable !
american	the service was very curt . the steak burger was bland and overcooked . the bread was stale . my wife found a piece of red onion skin in her burger . we opted for adding bacon to our burgers but the employee failed to mentioned that they didn 't have real bacon - only turkey bacon . what terrible service and food .
american	although the staff was very nice , it did not make up for the tables being sticky and the filthiness of the restaurant . ruby 's should not charge their customers $ 8 for a cold , greasy egg and cheese sandwich .
american	shabby appearance outside and in and a very unfriendly staff , food is lousy even for a chain restaurant . too many decent pizza places in charlotte to settle for this place .
american	they were out of almost all sides , chicken was coming back from other guest raw .. run by amateurs the manager really didn 't care and the counter register person was nice but unapologetic for all the issue . we got a refund and went to browns chicken where they actually wanted our business . browns was out of coleslaw but promptly made a fresh batch .
american	worst service i 've ever had , apparently under new management , they should quit now ! ! 1 . orders came out wrong . 2 . old guy server had his thumb on my eggs as he put my plate on the table . 3 . our server want attentive whatsoever to the point we had to flag her down ever 5 minutes to give us items she either forgot or didn 't bother asking if we want . 3 . she gets order wrong them comes to you with the menu to verify what you chose . 4 . food was cold . 5 . old guy sever puts his hands on the pancakes to check for temperature , gross ! ! !
american	very slow service . very slow food . food was sub par ( which for the price is understandable ) . they gave me my orange juice warm . avoid this place . you 're better off getting mcdonalds breakfast at least their service is better .
american	the cost of the food is way to much for how mediocre it is , figured be a good burger , but hell no . customer service was bad , acted as though we were bugging them . will not do this one again , dont know if i will do any fatburger again . pricing is not reasonable for what they serve .
american	it is not worth the three hour wait . every buffet i 've been to in vegas the wait staff were kind and accommodating . i usually order hot tea with oj and when i did here the waiter questioned my drink choice as if it was added work for him . the only pro is the crepe station until some random person cuts in because they know someone at the front . overall it 's not worth it , food is subpar , go to aria instead .
american	this place has lost its verve . it still has a great view ! however , the service is sluggish . the scallops and panchetta sounded good to me . big mistake ! sauce was butter plus mccormick scallop seasoning . scallops were not fresh , although i did eat later in the evening . basically a big avoid !
american	home of cold pizza and over cooked chicken wings that are left to drowned in sauce to get soggy . customer service is absolutely horrible ! good luck if you choose to try . better off just getting frys pizza next door
american	horriable service and they have no idea what they are doing . we ended up walking out to a cold breakfast and 45 min wait . plus saw our waitress once in 45 min . aweful , will not be back .
american	we were looking for a quick bite before the show at bally 's so we popped into the tequila bar . we only orderd a couple of hamburgers . they were cooked to order , but you could tell the beef was not fresh and had no seasoning . the fries were stale . the service was beyond slow . i have never had a good meal at any restaurant at bally 's and do not care to give them another chance .
american	although you can find a pretty good gelati the rest of the fair is pretty crap . the coffee is terrible and the service is complete crap . i tried it a few times and it stayed crap .
american	i paid $ 11 for two very mediocre slices of pizza ( no drink ) . obviously not fresh and not a whole lot of taste regardless . there are definitely better options at the airport , both in terms of quality and bang for your buck .
american	tried the ribs last week , no flavor and very fatty .
american	it is not the johnny rockets you love . never mind that the prices are double to triple normal . your jr makes cheese fries from cheese . this place pours on processed slime food product . this place advertises chili fries , but doesn 't have any . no hot dogs . no refills . at your jr , servers have esprit . maybe even dance or sing . not here . and , slow , even during light periods . and expensive . try $ 12 for a burger , $ 3.89 for one cup of soda , and $ 7 for a milkshake . i went here because i thought they 'd sell me something worth buying . not this place .
american	the service is horrible . the prices are thru the roof ... the kitchen and staff are stale , salty , and beaten down by their manager . no laughing alliwed ... she told me .. i said , no laughing is my place from hell and i left . not dave or brian or ashley or other good staff . but manager hates hearing laughter . dave laughs a lot . i bet he gets fired next week . whatever . if you want not to laugh , get lousy service and pay for chemical and sugar and fake chocolate for $ 100 for family of 4 .. maybe after a funeral .. be my guest . lol
american	i went on a saturday , early afternoon . it was bedlam . i was seated promptly . i was totally ignored from then on . the waitresses carefully looked the other way as they brushed past my table . i was dressed at least as well as other diners . tables for two or more were being thrown their food . after waiting for 15 minutes , i graciously left . the servers and host weren 't around to notice . such treatment deserves documentation and no return back . i don 't return to restaurants that ignore me . that list is very short : one .
american	save your money and eat anywhere else . ordered the cornbread which was clearly microwaved and disgusting . cobb salad has pre grilled packaged chicken . chopped brisket tastes like beef jerky . whole family is sick and puked most of it up . would have complained but we are on a staycation and just wanna have a good time .
american	the good was par for the course . we had a shwarma sandwich and bbq chicken . the chef flipped out on us about whether we wanted fries . the menu clearly says that all sandwiches are served with fries , but the cook thought differently . he actually came out from the kitchen , raised his voice , and asked us directly if we " requested " fries . it was very rude and abrasive . i will not be back .
american	bland fried rice , salty biscuits & gravy , & a cardboard tasting rice krispy treats .
american	the wings might have been the worse i have ever had . the wife and i love wings and we could barely choke down 2 each . french dip was dry and tasted like eating a block of salt ... i 'm not even sure how you do that with the ' dip ' part but they did . the beer selection was okay at best ... wish 4-peaks wasn 't crowded and i didn 't have to look for an alternative . the only way this place has a rating about 2 stars if if the people that work there or their friends are rating it .
american	they don 't need groupon coupons to drive business , they need to fire their staff and hire people who actually want to work and be in the service industry . waited over 30 minutes while the server walked past us several times , used her cell phone twice and then continued to chat with the bartender and other staff . other tables were getting same service and up and left . 3 other staff walked past our table several times and couldn 't even bother to acknowledge . there 's a lot of other great places if you are craving a burger .
american	they wouldn 't let me and my wife drink at this empty restaurant at the bar . we were told we could only stay at the bar if we ate . i understand this if the restaurant was full or if they were going to become full , but this place was the empty . no joke , it was 15 percent full at tops and stayed that way all night ( we ended up eating next door at the magnificent au pied de cochon ) . the server was super rude as well . zero stars !
american	my company orders all the time for work functions , and i consistently go hungry due to these people sending " vegan options " such as a yogurt granola bowl , a sandwich with mayonnaise or simply nothing at all ! in this day and age , all i have to say is no thanks !
american	we got the 24 hour 5 buffet deal , this was the last buffet we hit and was a complete let down , it stinks , all the food was overcooked and unappetizing , the bathrooms were unkept , my whole family felt sick the rest of the evening , never going here again ! ! ! i have 3 boys and the can eat ! ! ! but they weren 't fans either
american	they serve day old pretzels when they first open up . never get their frozen strawberry lemonade as it is nothing but froth and tastes very strange . i also saw employees handling money and then food . they need to be reported to the public health department . yikes !
american	the service was deplorable . it took 20 minutes just to get water which was never refilled . we had to ask for the dessert menu which we never received . i would expect much more from an establishment that charges $ 50 for an entree .
american	out of 28 people , 11 found hairs if their meals , so owner offered 15 % off ! coffee refills were hard to come by as we were ignored by all other staff and waitresses but when you find hair in your food everything else doesn 't really matter . wow , amazing to think that a place like this could still be on business , worth a drive anywhere else , do not eat here , absolute waste of money . i gave this one star as i could not remove it , no stars is what i would have rated it .
american	they 're menu is large and uninspired ... it 's like they 're trying to please such a wide-array of guests ( tourists ) , that they tend to fall flat on flavour . they 're atmosphere is very dated and confusing . their dining room is all white with pillars and chandeliers , while their bar area looks like you 're walking into the secret garden . but they 're llbo licensed in the eaton centre , so that earns two stars ( i like booze ) .
american	i tried it again , thinking my last experience was just a bad day . nope , disappointed again . the soda was flat , the biscuit was hard , and the chicken was cold . and the people working there are more interested in what they did last night than helping their customers .
american	this is my normal go to place when i land in charlotte every other week , usually on friday . this week happened to be a tuesday . wow never again- cold food- waited 20 mins for her to show up- she put the check down and said i need you to sign this . never asked me if i wanted anything else . horrible service today ! ! ! !
american	highlight of the buffet was the apple cobbler . everything was cold or barely warm and lacking any kind of flavor . its funny , i read another review that said something about it feeling like a nursing home cafeteria , and it somewhat does . it wasn 't the cleanest either . i went on a weekday evening and i think it was around $ 18 a person . definitely not worth it .
american	beef patty was disgusting so as brioche ( cheap imitation of brioche ) . bbq sauce is probably from 99cents store . sweet potato fries is absolutely and definitely pre frozen from a supermarket . its tasteless . salad is even worth . shrimps were just boiled. no seasoning , or anything . boiled tasteless shrimps . bunch of spinach , way too much dressing and yeah , 2 slices of avocado . guess they should change the name and take avocado off the name . disappointed . service girl was good tho , very friendly and pleasant . and she is the only reason this place gets 2stars .
american	went there on a livingsocial coupon and won 't be going back . the food was far below average . the service was ok , but by no means great . the waitress seemed new and not very used to the job . the place was virtually empty ( 3 tables total ) and she seemed overwhelmed . the menu is definitely uninspiring . if you have a diner , you should at least be able to be somewhat original with the food choices . definitely never again .
american	appetizers served with dinner while main dish got soggy . manager stated " most people want wings with dinner , " instead of being understanding . then why is it labeled appetizers ? ? ? ? he offered wet naps and never brought them , never offered a discount or came back to see if everything was ok . poor customer service . we paid for a full meal and didn 't eat 80 % ugh left very unsatisfied , hungry and an irritated stomach .
american	we went in for appetizers and dessert . she asked " you 're only here for that ? ? " then later when we asked about dessert menu options she reviewed the options , and snubbed us for asking what flavor the bread pudding was . yes , daniella , there are many flavors of bread pudding ......... she didn 't bring the coffee that was ordered . basically she acted as if she was annoyed by having to serve us , sorry we came in to dine at your place of business . although my friend swears this place is good and the owners are sweet , i can guarantee i won 't be back .
american	fried chicken was dry and lacked seasoning and the waffle was ' flat ' . hubby 's burger was better . not happy !
american	food was from the buffet which is ok if you are at a buffet . when we were waiting to be seated a woman stormed out while saying the service was slow . our waitress thought she was funny but not so much.i believe the space should have stayed as a high roller room . it would have been just as useful . lol
american	ordered the porterhouse medium rare , it arrived cold and super rare . waiter chatting incessantly through out the meal , hard to enjoy the company we were with . a poor reflection on the owner of this restaurant , as i am sure most people go there because of the owner . had a nine pm reservation and still had to wait more than 30 minutes for our table in a restaurant that clearly wasn 't full . save your time and your money .
american	promises-promises . you 'll get better results from davis salvage - either mesa or phx place is busy and they quote small orders but can 't maintain a schedule to make delivery .
american	a weak 2 / 5. service is below average , takes 5-7 minutes just to get an ice tea refill. the items which i ordered ( chard and lamb chops ) were okay but the grilled vegetable that we ordered for the table was below our standards and the bread they start you off with is not good. i would not recommend this place .
american	come on . pretentious feeling full of yuppie businessmen . would have liked to eat here but didn 't plan ahead 3 days .
american	first off , the atmosphere is truly vintage 50 's and currently decorated for christmas which i loved . i fully expected jimmy stewart ( it 's a wonderful life movie ) or santa himself to come through the door . had ham and over easy eggs , beans , home fries , fried tomato and toast . the toast which was irish soda bread was fantastic . the beans were from a can which i saw but that 's ok , the eggs were very much over easy and lacked any kind of substance , the ham was kind of a shaved mapleleaf sandwich ham slices . so needless to say i was disappointed with the breakfast . i need to try it again .
american	i am not sure what this entails , but offering me free garbage called shake shack isn 't going to change my yelp posting . your food is trash and i won 't consume another bite .
american	this clearly indicates that management could care less about their patrons within their establishment . will not be returning ! !
american	the monty cristo was not good . i love monty cristo sandwiches , but this place batters abd fried them . the batter was soggy and way too much batter . it was a big disappointment . my wife had the western omelette the onions and peppers were very undercooked . her bagel was dry and void of any blueberry flavor . save yourself some disappointment and go elsewhere .
american	dreadful food and bad customer service . bartender is unfriendly and obviously hates his life . no smile , no hello , no thank you . asked if something is good and he was like , yeah it 's great , with an attitude like just order already i have no recommendations and no clue about the food nor do i care about it or you for that matter . lol . seriously . but , props for a decent drink at least , that he did well . that 's why 2 stars . and to title yourself as a gastro pub is just wrong . please go elsewhere . i won 't come here again even if it was free .
american	better off skipping lunch or eating at one of the other restraunts at the mail . if you must have a cheese steak go to corleones it 's closer to pats steaks in phili
american	they offered to fix our orders while we have the home fries and guess what ... we never received the food ... and we were charged for home fries ... with tip included ... do not waste ur time and money and just have a simple scrambled egg at ur home
american	my husband wasnt getting his plate cuz they forgot to order it . i hated my experience i do not recommend it to anybody and its pretty pricey for breakfast . the plates are not generous . good luck to the owner
american	stopped by on our way to az . how do you screw up a spicy chicken sandwich & a buttery jack ? here .. spicy chicken sandwich that had bacon on it and we got a double cheeseburger not a buttery jack with bacon on it the fries were cold and the rice bowl that we ordered with no chicken had " chicken " on it don 't go here . they asked for the food back but i 'm going to arizona . kiss it ..
american	we had a reservation at capital grille however concierge service at ritz carlton suggested we change to five church . the staff is very pleasant . the ambiance is average . the food is less then average and bland . the menu is limited . it was very disappointing .
american	worst cobb salad with weird stringy chicken , nasty ranch , guacamole in a tube , and lettuce from a bag that should of been tossed three days ago ! service absolutely sucked for being in an airport with people trying to grab flights .. i 'd of been better off at a fast food chain .
american	' like a chicken-wrap where maybe there was a sliver of the bird , but your taste buds are sayin ' all-salad . ' and a glass of ' simi cabernet ' that ain 't nothin like any simi-cab you 've had before ( color more like a light pinot ) . add it all up 2 wines , 2 entrees and the tab comes to $ 42 ... ain 't no-way worth it .
american	i went with a friend . we had two single pizzas and one side salad . the cost was $ 30 . the food is awful . i 'm sorry it really is . and way over priced . the atmosphere is really nice though . but ya , it 's a no go .
american	good location : walk to old town scottsdale . food at zuzu was quite good . but ... parking valet staff was pushy , rude , and outright lied about the availability of self parking -- makes a really bad first impression . found trash on the floor in the room . otherwise , room looked clean , but makes me wonder how clean it really was .
american	the vegetarian options are the same ( tinyish ) sammich 3 ways , with a replaced ingredient . roasted peppers and sundried tomatoes abound . or you can get a salad , add tofu , and drop 8 bucks on a somewhat tiny plate of veggies . dressings are uber-run-of-the-mill . lemonade . bad . no kick , no sweet . employees , smiley , quick . plus , who wants to spend lunch hour in this food court ? yeesh . it 's like it 's 1995 and vegetarianism isn 't cool yet . luckily it was 1 / 2 price sammich day , or this would be a crankier review .
american	unfortunately the food doesn 't keep up with the ambiance . prices were high for pre-made food . throw a chef in here and it could be an amazing spot .
american	every week i take advantage of their large one topping for $ 5.99 . it is pretty good but time and time again their service is lacking . the poor kid at the register gets sworn at by the manager , you get told in correct pick up times , and delivery food services get first dibs . i couldn 't even get acknowledged today when i was trying to buy a soda after i paid for my pizza . but i 've learned my lesson from now on i 'll spend my $ 5.99 on digornio
american	awesome decor , including bathrooms the food that i 've ordered was terrible ( breakfast sandwich ) , oily , to many spices , burned potatoes .
american	finally a place where you can get a real burger . mushroom swiss my personal favorite !
american	if you get animal style on the fries , it is a $ 2.05 mark up for an upgrade ... wth ? that 's ridiculous ! i could understand $ .50 or $ 1 but $ 2.05 ? ? ? ? crazy ! ! i just got my food and they got my order wrong ... jeez
american	empty tables , mis-managed tables and getting people in and out to turn a table. waited 30 minutes for the check ! come on improve ! ! !
american	horrible service . our server took 12 minutes to greet our table only because i asked a server where our sever was . this is coming from a table of three- all of whom work in this industry . lucky their product is good , but worth the wait ? no . server was nice but never apologized for the wait time nor checked on us after the food came out . nothing was done in a timely manner , if it was done .
american	i got the pretzel egg sandwich for breakfast that was delicious but had absolutely terrible service ! ! we were the only people in there and waited 30 minutes for our food ! it 's an open kitchen and we saw the cooks chatting for a good 20 minutes before they pulled the ticket .
american	awesome friendly great service and open late for all the graveyard people in this town ... also great view of airplanes coming and going ..
american	cheese is ok but their gravy is awful . smokes is way better period .
american	it took over 20 minutes to get a glass of water . the couple next to us sat after we did but they got their water immediately . we will not return
american	i have tried to give their food multiple chances but , i leave disappointed every time . however , the atmosphere and drink selection are perfect for a fun night out in arcadia , just don 't come hungry .
american	awesome sandwiches but was aggravated because they don 't accept american express credit cards .
american	had a buffalo sandwich loved it . the entertainment was great . sat out on the porch , great ! the waitstaff ... not awesome , i felt like i was at dick 's last resort ... i annoyed our server when i asked for anything ..
american	the sweet tea was sour . the bread was tasteless and the marinara tasted like microwaved ragu . the ranch was watered down for my brown lettuce salad . the shrimp was like rubber . this place is a hot mess .
american	purchased a buffalo chicken sandwich and burger with a side of fries and a drink . after waiting 10 minutes , i expected food to be hot , but instead the sandwiches were cold and the fries were barely warm . 25 dollars later , i won 't be back . i seriously had a better chicken sandwich at mcdonalds and far cheaper .
american	almost no cheese , and what was on it was barely covering the tip of the slice . incredibly grumpy staff . i should have walked to another concourse but i didn 't have much time . concourse b1-14 is the orphan concourse now ; so many better options for food in other concourses . well , at least the slice was hot .
american	only thing preventing this from getting 1 * is the fact that the poutine was not bad . i don 't understand how they can mess up not adding ingredients to an order . service was unfriendly . skip this and go elsewhere .
american	and the coffee was terrible like it was reheated . the service was great and quick but not worth it for the food .
american	never returning to this one again . employees standing around the counter talking while the restaurant is filthy . forgot my bacon . no effort to replace the ketchup dispenser and the peanut bowls . absolutely unacceptable .
american	arrived early for my daughter 's appointment at levine children 's hospital up the road and decided to come here for lunch based on yelp reviews . my wife and i orders at the same time - she got a salad made to order with cooked shrimp and i got a turkey wrap . they completely forgot my order . wrap said it was made with turkey roasted in store but it tasted like deli meat turkey - slimey , gelatinous , and had virtually no taste . the rest of the ingredients were fine but the turkey ruined the whole thing . all this for $ 23 ( salad , wrap , and 1 drink ) ? no thanks . go elsewhere .
american	do not patronize this establishment . delivery time quoted of 70 minutes was less than half of what actually happened . the management demonstrated zero interest or concern for their error and poor customer service . let them go out of business and hopefully a pizzeria with management that gives a darn will take over the space .
american	disgusting , looking terrible food . slow lazy waitress . plastic cups for souses , old disgusting utensils. guy from valet parking wearing dirty clothes just hanging around food facility , small talking to waitress . dirty old tables and chairs . dirty bad looking cooking table . only one thing good looking there is fridge with pies . we paid 50 $ for terrible omelets and pancakes . no fruits , no toast , nothing . hash-brown was tasteless . if you want better breakfast in this area , just go to the golden nugget or plaza . even dennys is better !
american	-i ordered eggs over hard , but they undercooked them -when i asked them to cook it a little more , they burned them . -the sausage was tasteless . -no free refills on iced coffee when coffee is unlimited . the only difference is once has ice ! nice decor , but sketchy bathrooms . they must 've spent their time and money on decorating and not food . if i could give this place zero stars , i would .
american	literally one of the worst dining experiences i 've ever had . the food was awful , the service was terrible and the ambiance was uninviting .
american	awful . awful making a decent cheesesteak is not difficult . this had zero flavor and was overpriced . will not try again . * * update . the regional development manager contacted me to try and resolve the issues . i have to say this was a really classy move . a good business knows that to improve customer traffic and retention , you should always offer an amicable solution when a customers experience is bad . kudos for that . i would have to increase my rating just for that .
american	only time will tell if my fiance and i will get food poisoning from this buffet . every single dressing at the salad bar had a thickened , congealed layer on top- looked like instant sickness if consumed . the food selection overall was limited and left a lot to be desired . we have the 24 hour pass and the other buffets have been great . but if i just paid full price to eat here , i would have demanded my money back .
american	they were getting almost everyone 's order wrong . i waited 30 min for a lobster roll order they couldn 't find ? what make it again i have the receipt ! it 's a wednesday afternoon get your act together . i wish i spent $ 17 anywhere else .
american	the hostess ' were stuck up and seemed put out to have to seat us ( apparently holding up the wall was more important ) . the food was awful - i can make a better steak at home . we were seated next to a group of men who felt the need to yell and be inappropriate which the wait staff didn 't do anything about . we will not be coming here ever again
american	waitress was friendly and prompt , but after our order was put in it took over 30 min for the food to reach the table . i ordered pineapple upside down pancakes . i don 't know how you can mess up pancakes but they did . the pancakes were so bland and the pineapple was sour . terrible ! the country fried steak and gravy was good though . between the wait and the awful pancake experience turned me off . i 'll go elsewhere .
american	waited for over 30 min to be seated and 20 min for the check at the end . not ever going back
american	what the heck is this place ? ! way overpriced with the worse quality food than mcdonalds ! too be honest , mcdonald 's is more delicious than this place ! ! ! the burgers look good , but taste horrible . i think the meat is frozen and cooked in a microwave ! they don 't even ask you how you want your burger to be cooked ! ! ! that should have been my first hint not to order here ! the fries taste like pure salt- yuck ! do not go here !
american	lettuce was old and half of it was brown .. husband 's sandwich cold and dry ..... this is the second try ... no better than the first . and might i add ... we were excited to see a firehouse opening here .. we visited one in germantown tn when there on business ... and ended up eating there everyday for a week it was so good ! ! ! !
american	awful . bench seating was the most uncomfortable ever experienced . dreary bland breakfast food . hoping for better . mandalay bay buffet 20x better .
american	spent 150.00service was terrible . took 27 minutes to even be acknowledged . really . the only saving grace was the kids had fun and the hostess took amazing care of us ......
american	bacon cheeseburger was missing bacon and cheese . it took 15 minutes to fix . chicken alfredo was cardboard with noodles that had 1 tablespoon of something that looks like curdled milk .
american	bad food . chicken wings came out bloody . i was never asked how o wanted my burger . they just brought it to me . food is pre-made somewhere else . we had to flag down server for refills or just to notice us at all . never eat here . you will regret it .
american	awful bad service 40 minute wait for terrible food waiters blamed it on no shows for cooks
american	i was hoping to get food made with love because this is a locally grown restaurant , but the food was on par with the last bowling alley bar i ate at . i tried the fries topped with house made pimento cheese and brisket - the fries were frozen crinkle cut fries ala orida grocery store style . brisket was dry and seemed to have been sitting under a heat lamp for a while . this was one of those meals that i wish k had never eaten .
american	basic buffet.not only is it more expensive than wicked spoon but presentation is gross . the food was just ok . nothing special.not coming back . the seafood station was the only thing that was nice .
american	i expected more from a holiday inn restaurant . cold powdered eggs , cold bacon and nasty sausage and biscuits . coffee was good ..... server was excellent . its not like they don 't have a kitchen . why are they microwaving powdered eggs ? i stay at a lot of ihg hotels and this was worse than a a holiday inn express meal ..... but the same type .
american	brunch took over an hour to get our food . server was not attentive . food was cold . the restaurant was empty too . just a really poor experience .
american	was here for lunch today and the food was all fried and disgusting ! they even messed up mac and cheese . ( they don 't even use decent fake cheese ) ! ! ! ! ! booths are annoying and uncomfortable . overall , it may be cheap but spend a little more for a higher quality buffet .
american	it was overcooked , dry as a bone , and not even warm . the beef had that characteristic livery flavor of cheap meat , and a strange bitter crust on it . service was pretty much nonexistent . we saw servers , but all they seemed to do was hang out at the wait station . they certainly weren 't coming by our table . i really wish i had read the other reviews of this place before coming here . to be fair , the waitress did comp the meal even after we ate the burger ( which we only did because we were starving ) .
american	burger was not cooked properly , they forgot the sautéed onions on the burger , and the onion rings were waaay too salty . we sent them all back . for the money , you can get much better food right next door .
american	burger was wrong . no mac & cheese on a mac and cheese burger . fries cane out not as we ordered . we also ordered sweet potato fries and didn 't get them . horrible service . i would drive to the mesa location and avoid this red robin . after all that the manager would not even discount our food .
american	the service here is beyond slow . but let 's get to it already then ... the food is just awful ! the pizza had a very weird taste to it and none of us could finish eating it . i seriously think the cheese was bad or something because hours late all of us started cramping and fighting over the bathroom . avoid avoid avoid
american	cheap greasy food . service was slow on the two occasions i ate there . the salad was overly dressed . the potatoes over cooked . there are far better places on danforth .
american	cold mac n cheese , undercooked green beans , over blackened catfish and brisket i had to put so much sauce on to make it taste good . in addition , the bartender didn 't know how to make an old fashioned . c 'mon ...
american	45 min wait for a hamburger ? you might want to let people know that before they order . never again . should have went to in and out . shake shack , you can go f urselves .
american	first time there and the waitress didn 't explain the menu but sure as hell charged me $ 0.60 for the tiniest cup of ranch . when we go to leave we walk back into the restaurant and 3 waitresses are standing there and won 't move . one waiter told the girls to move and they still stood there . worst first time experience and won 't be back
american	gave us the wrong order , over priced for the quality . when called back to voice my concerns was placed on hold for 15 minutes . can 't wait until abruzzi 's starts delivering .
american	lady was rude when we got there . left us standing at the counter to order for five minutes . came back and didn 't ask if we were ready or anything . when we finally got our food my burger the animal was over cooked and my oldest son 's ( 10 ) chicken basket was under cooked . needless to say he got food poisoning . my older brother recommended this joint . i was not impressed either by the certificates they had displayed from 5-6 years ago . i will not return ever .
american	only one server works at a time . one server even used foul language while talking to us . we have been frequenting the rogue tomato for a little over a year now and i 'm truly disappointed in the poor quality of service in the past few months . yesterday , we had made a reservation for a party of about 12 . we were called about 3 hours beforehand and told that they couldn 't accommodate us . we had to scramble at the last minute to find a place to our friends birthday .
american	so disappointed . i often visit the jimmy john 's in los angeles and have always had a positive experience . unfortunately , not so for this location . the " shift manager " " david " refused to inform me of whom his supervisor was . i will not visit and spend my hard earned at jimmy john 's any longer .
american	takes a long time for food to arrive . server was rude and seemed like she hates her job . when my husband asked her one question about the food she replied with an annoyed tone and wanted to rush us . never coming to this location again .
american	waited close to 15 at our seats with no one taking our order . wanted the burger where there was only 30 per day , 3 people sit down next to us and order the last three . every restaurant i 've been to serves people on a first come first serve basis . guess this place doesn 't know proper customer service . will not be going back there .
american	we went through the drive through and the order was wrong , their debit machine didn 't work , waited 20 minutes for 2 orange juices in their drive thru parking spot . after waiting 15 minutes my daughter went inside to tell them we would just take soft drinks the manager told her to go back and wait for the oj .
american	what kind of place hires people who will answer the phone with what up what do you want ? that is trashy and if you can 't get an order right find another job this is pathetic ! do . otherwise give this location your business there are better pizza joints all over this town close to here and obviously they don 't care very much about their customers regardless so they shouldn 't be bothered by losing them !
american	dirty and dingy . ice cold food . meager portions . my husband ordered sirloin steak and got one slice of meat , coldashed potatoes , on a bed of wilted lettuce . i had six tiny ice cold shrimp with ice cold mashed potatoes on a bed of wilted lettuce . filthy bathroom . filthy carpet . no wine list . do not go here ever ! !
american	disappointed . the green valley location is great but this location on warm springs is so bad i wouldnt eat there for free . they got the order wrong , left our smoothies under the heat lamp , forgot my sons food and when we finally got it the order was wrong . the onions rings were burned and the rest of the food gross . the employees there are to busy cleaning their nails and checking their phones . they also over charged me and gave the wrong change back .
american	the service is abysmal and the food is all frozen , cheap fast food . the decor has not been changed since the day it opened . as bad as the restaurant it 's even more egregious when you look across the river and see the east bank restaurants that are awesome . there is nothing redeeming about this restaurant ; avoid it at all cost .
american	do not be fooled by the good / great reviews ... $ 45.08 large deep dish = 7 slices + 1 antipasta salad. pizza is really salty , greasy and small. horrible .. very disappointed ! ! i don 't mind paying if the product is worth it , this was sooo not .
american	don 't go for breakfast for sure . no meat to put in eggs or salad . i sampled several items & it was blah to gross . skip it . save your money & calories .
american	don 't know how it has good reviews . my filet came out way too well done , had absolutely zero taste to it and my girlfriends chicken pillard was awful , not to mention they gave us the wrong meal at first . the only good part about it was the really nice and fun heavy weighted guy , he 's cool .
american	do yourself a favor and avoid this location at all cost . since i 've not had a bad experience at sony and this was my first time ordering from this location , i thought the star rating was an anomaly . nope ! ! didn 't get everything i asked for and it was luke warm at best . no wonder only 2.5 stars . $ 38 for a small pizza ( loaded with zucchini which i asked to be removed ) , a beef sub which was dry and flavorless and the garlic cheese bread without the marinara sauce i asked for . it 's not rocket science folks ... just read the customers direction . simply disgusting ! ! avoid ! ! ! ! !
american	ordered two bacon gouda sandwiches and both were cold in the middle . also ordered a large unsweetened iced tea and we received a sweetened one ! they are in such a hurry to get people through that they compromise quality !
american	from the bad service , to the diluted soup , to the lame-no chicken on the chicken salad , to the pre-fabricated pizza . avoid this place !
american	everything is loaded with cheese and grease . wish i read the reviews . even lettuce on the caesars salad with light dressing was soft & soggy . go elsewhere ! ! !
american	everything is way too salty and overpriced . you can get a better burger across the street at 5 & diner . cool decor , though .
american	everything was bland . portions were small for the price . " butter " on husbands toast wasn 't even melted , a full tablespoon of it . even the coffee was incredibly watery and lacking in flavor . had high hopes based on the fox 8 news segment , very disappointed . would not come again !
american	arrive at 11 : 55 today . seated at 12 : 00 . 15 minutes later we had to get up and ask for a drink and for someone to take the order . we never saw a server again . at least not at our table . the people next to us got decent service . it seemed like the new their server . we finally had to leave . when we told the hostess on the way out . it was just , " ok " like that was a normal occur again . never again .
american	service was slow and inattentive . food was overcooked , undercooked , or came out cold or soggy . scallops were particularly bad-- texture was mushy like pre-frozen costco fare . i will never do dinner there again . ( though i will be back for the lobster club at lunch . . . )
american	super slow service with food not coming out at the same time . dry , over salted meat that was left out too long and chicken fingers that honestly looked as though they were cut in half- will not be back
american	our server ashely looked like she had taken one to many xanax . she could barley stand up straight . the food took forever to come . not cooked to my liking also . but when my 7 and 9 year old kids ask " daddy is the waitress sick " it 's a fucking disgrace . so pathetic . she 's a druggie and the restaurant was awful .
american	here 's my list : 1 . waited 10 minutes to be seated on a tuesday morning at 9 : 45 2 . one order the eggs were wrong . second order the meat was wrong . 3 . waited half hour for food to be brought to the table . 4 . had to ask for napkins and utensils . 5 . had to ask for refills on coffee and water . 6 . waiter mistakenly used my credit card for someone else 's bill then had to void that bill . 7 . never had these issues before what 's going on ? too many other places in mentor to return here again !
american	horrible service . food was cold . rude staff . took over an hour to get my food . had to chase staff down for a coffee refill . you 're better off going to sunset grill . overall , i wouldn 't recommend this place . with all the competition out there , i don 't see them lasting very long either .
american	waitress took our order , but never actually placed it . waited 45min for our food , owner didn 't seem to care , never got one apology . super disappointed will never return .
american	put a to-go order in about an hour ago and still waiting . while waiting , watched one person send back their order because it was wrong . they waited another 20 minutes for the revised order . just watched the cashier get ' fountain drink ' for a customer ... she cracked open a can of diet soda and poured it in the glass . shall i go on ? i could have gone to the mediterranean and gotten a meal there faster than waiting for this place . how hard is it to make a wrap ? ? ?
american	server was rude . food was average . ordered the short rib , it was more fat than meat . sent it back and got another piece even more fatty . disappointing experience .
american	ordered the oregano 's favorite salad . a quarter of the salad was not edible . disgusting , rancid lettuce . after calling over the manager , his response was to say he would check the lettuce supply to make sure no one else would have to endure what i did . how about what i had to endure ? not even an offer to remake the salad . those people just don 't care . management needs a lesson in customer service . will never return .
american	unfriendly and weird atmosphere . small and overpriced menu . requested soup and they didn 't have any . the drink i had was awful and overpriced . this is what i get for going to a different place than usual . i finished my drink and went to another bar . i will never return here again .
american	very poor service . they dont listen to you . brought us water after our meals were served . when asked for water , they got us empty glasses and asked if we wanted it in a glass . weird people . food was below expectations and pasta was half cooked . our starters were served along with the food . wtf man they were starters ! all because the cheesecake factory wait times were killing !
american	clearly not enough staff or foresight to expect large halloween orders . good food but not sure if i can come back if this wait will be the norm .
american	waitress spilt a tray of water on my husband . food was nasty . the lettuce in my salad was old and wilted and the chicken was cold and grisley not to mention the entire restaurant was dim and cold . we felt uncomfortable the whole time .
american	extraordinarily slow service . theming is all over the place . my daughter got the pasta and i got chicken strips , and her portion was far larger than mine and twice as cheap ! the food was very bland . sad !
american	fatty meat , hard fries , no bread service and expensive . we got a cheeseburger that had hard parts in it and the hanger steak which was so fatty we couldn 't even chew most of it . disappointing .
american	management and the server use the line " i didn 't say that " never coming back awful don 't waste a cent here
american	first of all , i 've been here a few times so this isn 't based on just one visit ... the food is good but the service is awful ! and today my husband and i walked out after waiting 45 minutes ! we never received our drinks or food ! meanwhile , the owner greeted the families to our left and right but never acknowledged us ... we 're disgusted ! we 'll never go back ...
american	i got back to the table , found that the bacon was cold too. brought it back again , asked them to remake the whole thing. got a 2nd burger , again with cold , unmelted cheese on it. gave up .
american	i won 't be back . too much for dennys grade food .
american	awful , food and service , place dirty , food sample platter not chicken tenders , they were like plastic .
american	the waitress barely checked in on us and she smelled like grease . the spinach dip was okay but the club wrap tasted like bad tuna .
american	went for breakfast . food was cold . and bland . then they charged me for someone else 's food and blamed it on their " system " instead of their incompetent staff . the manager ( lisa ) was completely unhelpful and never even apologized for their screwup . i wish i could give it less than one star . in sum , pretentious overpriced restaurant thinks they 're better than you . skip it .
american	the hardest worker in the place is the microwave . the heavy guy behind the counter is rude . i wouldn 't call a few packets of ketchup with your fries authentic . if you have the time , travel to marks street in henderson , the greek bistro is a 1,000 times better !
american	the only reason we stayed is we had a restaurant.com gift card for it . the prices are pretty high for terrible food and they couldn 't get the order right and it was just nachos and a burger ! if you 're gonna pay that much go o to yard house instead !
american	awful food awful service go somewhere else ... worst burgers dry cheese cake dry dry ck tenders .... seriously how do they stay in biz ... believe it or not twin peaks has seriously good
american	cold potatoe wedges soggy with grease and sausage that was fried fat with no real meat . where do they this stuff ? service is good but unfortunately that doesn 't fill your stomach .
american	coffee not hot . potatoes over cooked . omelet was mush : i have no idea how they did that . cost : $ 21 . waitress was great .
american	horrible date place . too loud . beer list rarely changes . this is the place you go to to break up with someone .
american	my eggs benedict was served with over poached egg and covered with a slice of cheese .
american	only thing i liked was the slushy . the burger was not good , fries were cold and the cheese sauce for fries was also given completely cold . horrible experience .
american	pretty sure it was frozen pizza . fingers were disgusting .. drenched in sauce and odd seasonings that tasted horrible . special was 2 slices and drink and gave options for toppings but can really only get cheese . false advertising . last but not least did not get my drink that was part of the " 2 slice and drink special " would never go back and would give zero stars if possible . waste of money .
american	soups are cold , chicken is old , salad dressings have other stuff floating in them . service is awful and no one cares when you tell them
american	they do not delivery so we called in to try their signature chicago-style deep dish pizza and chicken tenders . meh . pizza had too much cheese and the sauce was on the bottom . real chicago deep dish pizza is sauce on top . very unremarkable . pretty sure the chicken tenders came out of the frozen section at the grocery store . the pizza was maybe worst dish on the table ; it was unsatisfactory . our meal was $ 52 after tax and tip . wasn 't worth it . i 'm surprised they are still in business , especially with so many other great options . maybe the chicago-style pizza is worth it if you have the time .
american	they were dried out and rubbery as if they 'd been fried this morning and microwave reheated , and the sauces were overwhelming . i got an order of their french fries last week . they were fried just for me and were very good . these tonight were horrid . no way were they fresh fried . we had wings and fries left and threw them away . we knew if we took them home that they 'd never be eaten . not going to eat here again .
american	food was old and tasteless . worst buffet in vegas .
american	we had a party of seven and no one liked what they ordered . the spicy sushi rolls were bland . the beet garnish on the kale and beet salad had a black spot through every slice and the dressing was much too sweet . the pizza was served on a tortilla . the grilled cheese sandwich was without cheese . i do not recommend this restaurant and will not return .
american	for starters , the bread is horrible ( and without enough butter ) , it took over 25 minutes for them to bring out a fish dish and a sandwich because " the fries were too greesy . " -- what ? ! ? ...
american	decor is awful , service nonexistent . pricing is higher than the quality deserves . the worst fish sandwich in pittsburgh served with the worst side of chips ever , not one whole chip , all broken pieces and small broken pieces . pasta way overpriced at $ 15 .
american	from the poor , almost non-existent service to the flat soda and dry , flavorless sandwiches , nothing is worth recommending . granted , you get a lot of meat in the sandwiches but when you have to douse your sandwich in mustard in order to eat it , it 's not worth the $ 14.95 .
american	fruit at breakfast was obviously from day before . only one fresh fruit offering ? how do you ruin bacon ? juice wast juice , it was pink water . 18 bucks for this ? ? ? ? ?
american	grade is very low . of course i would have never ordered food if i realised it was almost a b ! you never get sauce for nuggets . the food is not even wrapped properly most of the time it 's just thrown in the bag . fries are always hard and cold . i don 't even know how they stay open .
american	had guests from ca in town and took them here . i was embarrassed . when one of my friends steak wasn 't cooked mid rare as requested and the server was informed , the manager on duty came over and rudely shined a flashlight on the food to " verify " and question him . how completely unprofessional which in turn made my friend just tell the guy in the suit never-mind just to avoid a further production . needless to say , we won 't be going back here again ! !
american	had lunch on a sunday with my family and nobody liked the food . why would expect people to pay to eat this mediocre crap . also a tip to the restaurant .. take the deviled eggs off your menu , those are so plain and blah . i don 't even know how you could decide to put those on your menu .
american	hillstone . just awful ; service food ... the whole thing . food was cold and poor quality . service , they just didn 't care . a tab of $ 187 one would assume you would get mediocre service but nope . i recommend taking your money elsewhere .
american	after going through the drive through we didn 't receive an order of fries , napkins , straws , or a bec biscuit we ordered . went inside to get them , came back out and had a long black hair in my biscuit . went back inside to have them make another one and one of the employees thought it was funny and proceeded to laugh and mock us . very unprofessional but they obviously don 't care . can 't even make a biscuit right .
american	oh yeah ! ! ! he took several items from our bill thank you for this but it is suppose to be a outback steakhouse was a terrible terrible restaurant and happened to everyone of our 6 different meals all ! ! ! ! wee horrible ... never again in any outback ! ! ! ! ! stay away or you get sick ! ! ! ! ! !
american	i almost never leave low star reviews , but this place was atrocious ... good start as we had a nice welcome , but all down hill after that ... my husband 's coffee cup was filthy with old lipstick & other debris ... then our eggs were way over done & to top the horrible breakfast off , i had several hairs in my food ... needless to say , we won 't be returning ...
american	iced tea tasted rotten . i ordered the beach club because it said it came with sprouts and avocado . got a sandwich w iceberg , turkey , tomatoes and lots of mayo . very disappointed .
american	i could make a better poutine at home ... $ 10 for unseasoned beef , snow peas and barely any fries with scattered chunks of cheese and a scoop of gravy , give me a break ! ! this place really puts the poo in poutine !
american	i enjoy a drunken trip to denny 's every few years . microwaved bacon . really ? server handed me a plate roughly the temperature of the surface of the sun . english muffin hit me in the face , then fell to the floor of a vegas denny 's . he said nothing . lol . egg shells in my food .... i didn 't order eggs .
american	if i could give it no stars i would ! ! ! ! awful ! ! ! ! way way way over priced for bad / ok pizza ... over $ 12.00 for 3 slices who do they think they are ... ? there food is ok at best ! i live and work uptown i will never go back and will warn friends to stay away ! ! ! ! awful ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
american	our server was great but the food was ... well , disgusting . we spoke up and management shrugged . avoid .
american	i got a pizza and a salad and it was such a disappointment . burnt pizza !
american	i have never eaten a more disgusting salad ( they call them bowls ) in my life . i ordered buffalo chicken in a salad bowl with lettuce and spinach and a bunch of other fixings and i got some cold lunch meat smeared with cold buffalo sauce . i paid an extra dollar for avocado and got some brown mushy crap that didn 't even resemble avocado . you 'd be better off at subway . oh , and my son 's grilled cheese sandwich was two pieces of stale bread with a slice of burned dry american processed cheese food slapped in between .
american	i 'm guessing most people give it a good review because they are trying to talk themselves into the idea that they had a good meal at a celebrity chefs restaurant in vegas . who doesn 't want to tell their friends and also say it 's great ! it 's not . it 's actually pathetic . avoid .
american	i ordered a burger & fries . the burger was flavorless and greasy ! how do you mess up a burger ! my husband ordered fish and chips . he ate less than half because the fish didn 't seem cooked all the way . dinner was a huge disappointment ! it 's over priced since it is located in a casino . i wouldn 't mind paying the high casino prices as long as the food is good ! dessert i ordered the ding dong cake . that was delicious ! ! ! ! ! but not enough to ever get me to go back !
american	i ordered the hoomus falafel pita and was served with browned / old lettuce . the falafel itself was mediocre , nothing spectacular and same for the hoomus . the service was pretty bad as well . it was a weeknight around 6 pm and there were a few tables with customers but it took them 25 mins to get my food out ! service was so slow and obviously understaffed with one cook ! i will never go back here again !
american	got there at 5 : 20pm on saturday and didn 't get our food until after 6 : 30pm . my beer came with a dead bug in it , and the beer was not even comped . the corn bread was from a week ago and could have been used as a door stop . not sure what all the hype is about with bubba q 's , i 've had better bbq at those fast food places in the south .
american	awful is being nice. group of 4 , two of us got the cod with corn and bacon. too smoky and the bacon was chewy. the roasted chicken was dry and the bread salad was hard and more like giant croutons. the chicken of the woods mushrooms should be renamed cedar chips. to add insult to injury , the bill was $ 220 for 4 people for dinner and a couple beers each. small snobby menu. waste of a dinner out. the old fashioned next door is 10 million times better .
american	not only was the service slow , the food was dreadful . came here in a family dinner , we were about 22people . every single one of us got sick when we got back home . we all had different meals and yet we all got really sick ! it was a horrible experience
american	it 's like eating in a retirement home . there is nothing hip , trendy or inviting ! the lobster / shrimp / crab bisque was cold and had zero lobster / shrimp / crab actually in it . the chicken was still completely raw inside . the lasagna was cold . this was after waiting 45 minutes for our food . the owner was kind , tried to fix it , but it was just too far gone ! the whole mess made us 30 minutes late for a commitment , the service was very , very slow ! 4 other restaurants have failed in this spot , i don 't understand why people keep setting themselves up for failure !
american	i 've eaten hear many times hoping to find something worth eating . everything is crap . as i sit here i am eating what they call a pizza . it is actually a small ball of dough with a tablespoon of sauce and a small handful of cheese . it covered a 12 inch plate but there was so little to it i 'm going to have to get a second dinner elsewhere . i had the risotto rosa a few nights ago and the sausage was dry and flavorless . the lasagna was incredibly salty and over cooked . i am currently being held hostage . they took my plate but never brought the bill .
american	i will never stay at wynn / encore . i was kicked out before entry because i possessed my medical marijuana card and medicine that i purchased from a local nevada business called reef dispensary. awful service and awful management . spend your money elsewhere !
american	i wish i would have read the reviews before we ate here . chicken sandwich was over microwaved .. and it 's kind of expensive ! don 't go here ever !
american	after waiting forever food sucks . i am so mad . i found a hair in my food . my friend food was cold .he sent it back . never again at this ihop
american	all the food was bland and tasteless . the steaks were dry and mealy , the waitress constantly kept saying , " i don 't know " to everything we asked and she would only tell us the larger sized beers because she kept trying to up sell . also they were out of medium rare prime rib , the mushrooms obviously came from a can , the potatoes were also dry and bland , and the au jus was some weird thick dark sauce . don 't go here , just go to outback , its slightly cheaper and much better quality .
american	completely ignored . i asked for a booth and was shown a table . i waited for a booth . so back to the waiting area where i was completely ignored . going to peppermill . super pissed off . now my buddy just wants to get to the hardware show . we 're hungry and pissed off . not returning . don 't waste your time . grrrrrrrrrrrrrr !
american	not very busy saturday night and it took more than 30 minutes to get our food ... which was lukewarm to cool when it arrived . the waitress apologized twice , but that did not help when we missed our movie . if i could give zero stars , i would . do not eat here under any circumstances .
american	just ordered tonight and it was absolutely terrible . philadelphia called , and they 're pissed . arrived warm , so no complaints there . but the ingredients were low-quality . dry meat and veggies , apparently cheese ( though you can 't taste it ) served on a hot dog bun . the " spicy fries " are bowling-alley quality . limp , flavourless , and mushy . this is a poor imitation of subway 's " southwest steak and cheese . "
american	just plain awful ! the halibut was decent tasting but a little too soggy , the fries were disgusting , similar to kfc fries , the salad was definitely not fresh and to top it all off , you call yourself the " halibut house " and you have tartar sauce packets ! ! ? ? ? what kind of fish and chips place gives out packets and pretends to be top of the line ? never coming back here again
american	just straight awful . i 'm not a health nut but serving 3 different starches in 1 meal is just crazy . the bread , fries and batter on the chicken strips is way too much . not to mention the batter on the chicken strips is terrible . no flavor and it just all felt like too much . never again .
american	just waited in drive thru line for 18 minutes for 2 happy meals and two 10 piece nugget meals . girl came to the window with marlboros and a lighter . said she needed to drop more fries . made the mistake of not checking the order- received two chicken sandwiches with hard buns and a happy meal with no toy and no fries ! guess the kids have to share ! just bad . watched employees meander and giggle while a line of cars waited impatiently behind me .
american	lamb chops were ordered medium rare but came out raw and still freezing cold in the middle . the staff didn 't seem to care , just taking the plate back and apparently microwaving them . but they came out raw again . $ 21 for three grisly small chops . another person ordered meat perogies but got cheese instead . the waitress actually argued that this is what was ordered and didn 't offer to make it right . the whole experience was simply terrible .
american	i have been here 5 times to meet family who found the location convenient . every time the tables and food was greasy and not in the greasy spoon good way . be prepared for a server that showers less than once a week ! ! gross . last complaint , when a restaurant has a menu with 300 things on it , the odds of your choice being fantastic are low . avoid , avoid , avoid ! !
american	the crab is wimpy and more like crawdads and the ambiance is more of a indoor picnic area than restaurant . it was hard to even get one good piece of crab to dip into some butter after paying a good price for the king crab special . i have given the place 3 tries and finally gave up . sorry .
american	portions are small , its not too expensive which made me feel happy at the end of the meal cause i would be really mad if i had to spend more than $ 25 for that awfull meal ! ! ! this place is for old people ! nothing exciting. i had fish sandwich on a very soggy bread , sides were very small , mac and cheese i had better from the box. the food is very southern style , not much of a healthy stuff on menu and for sure no choice for vegatarians or health concious , maybe thats the reason why everyone thats overweight is there. no ! we will not be back ! ! !
american	i had to repeat myself several times . over an hour an a half on a monday night for a salad and soup . by all means , please move at a glacial pace . the employees were more interested in having conversations and counting their tips than serving the customers . i had a reward and asked for it , took over 20 minutes . will not be returning to this bj 's .
american	worst fries ever . stale garlic bread . never again ordering from here
american	employees mope around like they hate their lives . it 's never busy and that 's an obvious concern . no one likes to support a business that doesn 't care about their customers or the employees of the establishment . it is absolutely a pathetic place to go for a " good time . " there are far better options and never will be back . disrespectful management is unacceptable .
american	management should be ashamed . they cannot put mustard on the dog in the restaurant which nullifies the entire hot dog eating experience . means they put the sauerkraut on them you have to put the mustard on top if you want it . only alternative is for them to give you the kraut on the side . really .... is this a legit hot dog stand ?
american	got the half roast chicken w / potatoes and greens . the chicken was overlooked to the point of the turkey in national lampoon 's ' christmas vacation .... " some of the thigh meat literally broke when i cut it . potatoes were undercooked . the greens were tasty but also undercooked . our waitress was pretty weak , too . barely even paying attention to us . no utensils , wrong menu . they buttered the pasta for the kids even though we asked them not to . and the iced tea could have taken the paint off my car , it was so wretched . not worth another visit .
american	awful .. mean .. no gratitude for your business .. no compassion what so ever .. went here with my 18 month old and fiancé early on easter sunday to beat the rush and have a nice breakfast .. ordered 1 crepe and 1 omelette .. 40 mins and no food .. i decided to walk my toddler around cause of course she was done waiting and she fell and started bleeding so we asked for it to go .. the french a-hole owner guy said " that 's why u shouldn 't bring babies to his restaurant " annoyed that we were upset cause we wanted to leave .. never going here again ! ! !
american	my daughter and i ordered the spaghetti and meatballs ... which i am pretty sure was from a can and a freezer bag . my husband 's lasagna tasted like cardboard and was prepared in a microwave . it was plated at the reception desk.my son 's pizza was ok .
american	my eggs were over cooked , but the bell peppers were raw .. and there was no way my omelette was 3 eggs , it was so small . my toast was burned and and swimming in butter , my bacon was burned and the hash browns were undercooked . there was 5 of us in my party and all of our food was awful .. how in the world is this place getting good reviews ? ? our server was a space cadet as well , she spilled the same cup of orange juice twice .
american	my wife and i waited way to long to get our pathetic burgers . i dont understand why this place insists on serving messy burgers on 2 inch paper plates . after the long wait for our food the server graham has the nerve to ask if i had cash instead of a card since their card machine is temperamental . i think he smoked about a gram due to his slowness and lack of attention . the " bottomless fries are pointless if your server only comes by once to drop off your food . i 'd rather eat a spoiled hamburger from the trash can of a dirty mcdonald 's than dine here again .
american	took us over 1 / 2 hour to get our food and there was like 2 other customers in there . one customer there before us got their food as we were leaving .
american	no other word aptly describes this place . how hard is it to make a decent grilled cheese sandwich ? slapping melted cheese in between two pieces of toast is not grilled cheese . and the eggs benedict ....... yuck .
american	one of the worst bars i have ever been in . the smell of this place will make you gag . never cleaned , floor is sticky yuck ! stay away !
american	ordered a rib eye sandwich , medium ... gray piece of meat tough as shoe leather served hanging out of a round , soggy bun . worst . sandwich . ever ! fries are extra , they were mediocre . the entire time we were eating someone was trying to unclog a sink in the dining room with a plunger and snake . very unappetizing . menu is very unimaginative , whole experience was mediocre at best . will never be back .
american	ordered the chicken shawarma gyro and hated it ! it tasted very fishy . don 't know why but with every bite it got worse . the gyro was also missing yummy tzatziki sauce . maybe they make theirs differently but trust me it needed it . mine came with a tiny bit of some brown stuff , and no it wasn 't hummus . that was another thing , their hummus was um , okay nothing spectacular . the only thing i enjoyed was their service and fries . not planning on returning .
american	our business dinner here could be summed up with that one word ... awful . if you go to stk for any other reason that is one thing , but the food was soooo bad , i would never eat there again especially with so many other restaurants in the same area .
american	our food sat in expo until we finally got up to get it . ( food was cold ) when we asked for our food the manager , katrina , stacked our food on top of one another . when we commented about her putting the dirty plate 's bottom onto the top of our food she rudely replied that it was " sanitary " disgusting ! i will never go back and with health code violations like that i 'd advise everyone i know to stay away from that restaurant ! gross !
american	app brought with our dinner and after asking for the melted warm butter for our lobster that they forgot the server brought 3 packets of cold butter meant for bread . acted put off when we asked for the proper butter . avoid this place , thank god we had gift cards and didn 't waste our money
american	over medium eggs came out with liquid whites that ran all over the plate . egg sandwich had rotten turkey bacon . egg shells in both dishes . not marriott quality . worst $ 40 bucks ever ...
american	over priced and the food is terrible . my sister received gray scrambled eggs , which the manager tried to explain away as being normal . our food was cold , the hash brown patties looked like toaster hash browns , the sausage was obviously from a warming tray , and it looked like the eggs were from a carton . i scanned the menu to check prices of other items and just about fell out of my chair ! $ 14 chicken strips , $ 11 chili dog . this place is a complete rip off . don 't let the lakeside view and decor make you think it 's high quality . it 's not !
american	tasted like frozen . waitress did not care that the i did not like the sausage pizza . her comment " we have been doing it like this for 50 years . " they need gordon ramsey to come taste their pizza . diner 's drive-in 's and dives you should be ashamed to say this was good pizza . stay away ..... this was the worst pizza i have had at a restaurant !
american	i love pancakes and these were nearly inedible . the first batch came out undercooked and had to send back second batch was just gross . will never go back again .
american	party of six and never even was acknowledged . wow ! this place is for sure a place to avoid . i can 't comment on the food because we never had a chance to order . we stood in the bar area for 10 minutes and had to initiate contact with the bar tender before even being welcomed . at this point , we decided to leave .
american	pasta over cooked . chicken over cooked , tough . nerve to serve chicken with boxed potatos and canned beans . overpriced . horrible , expesnive cars in lot . must be from chicago burbs . downtown people would neve eat at this shitty place .
american	awful place. after all the hype , clearly not worth it. tableside salad is a joke -- think bad salad bar rolling around , lousy lettuce and canned vegetables. service was atrocious. our food came after others who were seated 30 minutes after us. after hearing about hugos and waiting for another trip to vegas to try , we were extremely disappointed and the prices were twice what they should be for the food quality and the service. never coming back
american	but i detest bison , after trying it here . catering to a trend conscious hipster crowd , this place wants to have the latest foody goody . we 've had poutine and pulled pork mini-crazes on queen w. , well how about buffalo ? don 't say buffalo , actually , the strangely arrogant servers are very touchy . they railroaded me into trying their damn bison and i discovered there 's a reason it 's a trend and not a staple - its taste . you might as well eat a moose . pungent and gamey , i found it quite repulsive . but , if you want to be in on the latest trend ...
american	food over cooked , especially chicken . breakfast & other items are not cooked well. they do not wear gloves . place is hot & air not good . friends i know will not go back . if you are unhappy with review , too bad , it is the truth , correct the problems .
american	place is not clean , soda machines only have pepsi products and the tea is not freshly brewed tea at all , it is machine taste , kitchen is dirty and they do not wear gloves when preparing food . food is awful .
american	i was verbally and physically assaulted by one of their staff members recently . this young girl working the establishment went completely nuts and started screaming at us out of nowhere , followed us out onto the street shoving us and screaming , we had to call the police . i 'd been coming here a long time despite the disgusting excuse for poutine that they serve because it 's still , by a very sad definition , poutine , but no more . get your people in order .
american	kids just working here for a paycheck , they don 't care one bit about customer statisfaction . asked the ignorant kid in charge if he could split the order down the middle as me and my buddy got the two pizza deal and he said he " never heard of anyone doing that . " pathetic pizza , absolute garbage . stay away from this place . i 'm calling their corporate number after i finish this review . it is that bad .
american	looks like they use water from the toilet to prepare their coffee and tea , and you will end up waiting for the food for ages ... seriously , 1 hour to prepare a sandwich ? ? the only excuse i can see , if they grow a chicken on their kitchen before actually put it into sandwich .
american	awful place reminds me coffee time , my sandwich was cold and hard , nothing is fresh , pouting was cold and tasting like old
american	place smells like garbage and the service is poor . i could get over the garbage smell since i didn 't eat there , but the burger just was just not very good . place was empty and the employees seemed annoyed that i came and they actually had to do their jobs . fat burger used to be a place to grab an above average burger in my opinion , but this location defiantly is not .
american	the french toast they tout as indescribable can 't be described on the menu because the word they 'd have to use is " inedible " -- it was dry and flavorless . the noise level due to some stupid overhead maze using billiard balls is similar to being in a bowling alley . the coffee tastes like dishwater and the server was disinterested at best--just dropped off our coffee and walked away . my husband had to go to the busing station to find the splenda . this was our first and only visit .
american	slow service . the waiters act like they have never been in a restaurant before .
american	we went after a baseball game and it 's was packed . 30 minutes waiting for a table . the host was dumb . she had not idea what she was doing . i ordered a chicken sandwich and it was cold and horrible . my partner got spaghetti primavera and he got spaghetti pesto instead . never again
american	same issues with the sandwiches . seriously who dresses bbq like a hamburger ... the menu lies as well don 't rely on that . we will never return .
american	poor service , no excuse the place was almost empty ..... i would suggest to close the doors on this place. took forever to get the food. money was wasted .
american	pre-formed rubbery burger patties with zero flavor . the fries are soggy and under-cooked . reminds me of the tasteless harvey burgers i had as a teenager , when harvey 's was the only burger place ( other than steak n burger ) in town . toronto in 2009 deserves better .
american	to start , the cashier was less than enthusiastic and the food did the same to me . i had the fish burger with fries and both were terrible . the burger had basically just a piece of deep fried fish with a bit of iceberg lettuce . tasteless . fries were not crispy and also had no flavor . can definitely not recommend anyone this place . my first and last visit . worst burger in toronto
american	the fries at five guys are great , but that doesn 't make up for a 2.5x up charge .
american	provolone cheese wheel was a slice of deli cheese , heavily breaded , and deep fried . inedible .
american	came for brunch , ambience just ok . dishes tasted reheated and rotten . could not eat and complained to waitress who told me i could go to the dessert bar . cheap cakes and food that has been hanging around for ages . brunch is a scam here , don 't waste your time and fall for the views .
american	really . phenomenally bad . an hour and a half for scrambled eggs and pancakes ? ! ? ! and then these eagerly anticipated plates are inedible ? please . the icing on the cake was the fact that my pancakes were finally brought out 15 minutes after our plates were cleared away . when i said i couldn 't wait any longer - that i didn 't want the pancakes , nor did i want to pay for them - the manager / owner was nasty about it and yelled at my husband that she was now forced to throw food in the garbage . i love cleveland and i love a local joint , but the food and service here are a complete joke .
american	filled with incompetent staff and terrible management . we 've been to other logan 's locations in other states and always had a good experience . we will never go back to this location
american	it 's just the new name of another mediocre place in the same space . tried it today . the inept waitress spilled cokes and grape sodas on myself and my wife . free desert ... ? maybe something taken off the bill ... ? nope . food was ok at best . great job with the customer service .... not . maybe we will try this place again when it closes and reopens as something else next year . thanks for the sticky legs and the chicken strip for my pups !
american	this place is a waste of your time and money . my family just dinned at their new location ( they just moved from up the road ) . we spent an incredibly high sum for what we got . they bring out cold bread balls with some scalding marinara in a plastic cup . the host seemed offended when we inquired about a kids menu . the server was borderline rude . the portion of pasta they brought our five year old was more than a grown man could eat and priced that way too . this place is soooo ridiculously high for the gross pizza buffet quality food they serve . they got the first and last dollars they will be getting from us .
american	rude waiters , dirty dishes , served lettuce wraps with holy butter lettuce with hot meat on them ? ! 2 regrets , that i didn 't check yelp reviews first & honestly , i would have been happier with arby 's next door ! !
american	salt on salt on salt . mustard-based cole slaw ? ? about 8 people in the place at 1 : 15 . to add insult to injury , $ 9 for a small bbq plate which includes the nasty coleslaw and hush puppies ( which were salty but crispy ) . i added a side of fries for a dollar extra and got about 18 bagged , soggy fries . never going back
american	salt , salt and more salt . terrible server- he was worthless . did not know the basics of the menu at all . water glass stayed empty , brought entirely wrong drinks . everything was horribly over salted ; the butter for the bread ( chunks of salt in it ) , the overpriced steaks , the undercooked green beans , and yes , the fries too . oysters weren 't even good . very disappointing . will never waste our time or money again .
american	then one egg is $ 1.75 , asked for 2 ? eggs , charged $ 6 . also , servers do not know difference between salami & pastrami , i wanted pastrami & eggs , i got salami . service is bad.true review , correct the problem . do not insult the reviewer
american	seriously , don 't even waste your time . this location is extremely overpriced , the burgers don 't come with fries included ( extra $ 3 if you do want fries ) , and the tables and floor are not clean . the place could redeem itself if the food was actually any good , but sadly it wasn 't . very basic hamburger ( smokehouse ) with little flavor , which is surprising considering all of the toppings that come on it . if you have $ 9 to spend on a burger here , go find another restaurant to give your business to .
american	server was terrible , food was less than average , and price was extremely high for what you get . couldn 't pay me to eat here again .
american	30-40 min waits . i would not recommend them at all . this is the most revolting company to deal with . worse than rogers believe it or not . horrible service long wait times . i just switched to smart isp
american	if i 'm paying almost $ 50 for two wing combos then i expect proper portioning . usually wild wing chains are pretty good at that , but this one didn 't seem to care . barely a handful of fries in the single flavour and fries combo . don 't recommend .
american	the burgers and fries were 100 % frozen and the burger was dry , way over-priced and the beer on tap was flat
american	took 20 minutes for anyone to approach our table after being seated , and that was only because we had to ask the hostess to send someone over . ordered a burger and caesar salad . burger came out red , and caesar was brought as a side , not the full salad we clearly asked for . they ruined central bistro .
american	they never answer the " sub hotline " if they do , good luck because you will sit on hold until you give up trying to give this company your money . whoever owns / operates this place should be ashamed
american	fiancé was served bacon wrapped shrimp that was very undercooked . drinks took at least 15 minutes and our appetizer and food was a long wait . asked the server for ketchup and another place setting when we got our food , never came back . i got the chicken and artichoke pasta , chicken was over cooked and chewy . asked for a manager , he showed up 10 minutes later ... hot mess ! ! !
american	orders mixed up , think items omitted . i had the eggs and meatloaf . potatoes tasted bad and no toast given . spent a lot of time looking for our waitress . been in several times before and always satisfied . very , very disappointed this time .
american	slow service and did not prepare the pretzel consistently . forgot to butter / oil the pretzel which meant nothing stuck to it . i 'll go to the union station location instead .
american	avoid at all costs . many other places near the acc you can go to for a pre game meal . unless you want over priced food , slow service and union workers not helping you go there .
american	everyone working here had the too cool for school attitude . nobody approached us to let us know you seat yourself . this place tries to be more of a scene than a great food spot . it fails to execute in both areas . i heard the tempe spot was great , so when they opened a downtown phoenix location i thought i 'd give it a try . i recommend you pass .
american	we sat for about 25 minutes before i asked a server to help us , waited an additional 45 minutes for our food to arrive , and the order had a few errors . the server was disingenuous , which didn 't help the situation . i spoke with a manager , which i rarely do , and he genuinely seemed to care and helped us out . hopefully they work the glitches out .
american	food okay but you need to be prepared to spend the afternoon here .
american	love cheesecake factory , this location just sucks unfortunately .
american	do yourself a favor and avoid at all costs . seriously , do not come to this place . our greeting by the server , after waiting 10 minutes was " kitchen closes in 10 minutes . " not hello , not sorry for waiting . then when i asked for a milkshake the machine was " shut down for the evening . " never got the water we asked for , middle aged server avoided the table like the plague , and by the way , this was 930 on a saturday night with the place half empty .
american	not worth the money ! would never go there again . how could you run out of the soup of the day at noon ? not gluten free friendly . server had no clue .
american	awful food . wow . avoid at all costs . the reuben made me question my love for reubens and my company said the cheese tasted like plastic .
american	awful omelet- it was not even cooked correctly and it was cold . we waited for half an hour to get a table , then half an hour to order , then half an hour to get our food . we even asked for the check early and still waited a solid 20 minutes to be done . all in all , terrible service and sub par food . the pancakes are good , but ihop is better .
american	awful wait . awful prices . do not waste your money . if the franchise as a whole operates so poorly , i can 't imagine how it remains a viable business or why anyone would visit . the servers and bartenders spent more time standing and chatting than i did .
american	awful way to take orders . awful parking . don 't try this place unless you enjoy waiting 20 minutes to order and 20 minutes for cheesy hush puppies .
american	the food takes forever even in an empty restaurant . the food is over cooked and cold . i asked three times for milk and never got it . there wasn 't any silverware on our table , and after asking twice for it , we stole some from another table . our waitress was rude , inattentive and i think stoned . no one can be that dense without a mild-altering substance in their system or significant brain damage . it 's too bad it 's such a dive because it 's location is so cute . i hope someone who actually wants to run a cute diner will take it over and turn things around . until then , stay away !
american	after waiting over 20 minutes for our party of three to be seated when there was an abundance of open tables ( they didn 't want to push two tables together to accommodate our party , yet sat parties of two at large tables ... hmmmm ) we walked out . food is decent , but not worth the wait or lack of service .
american	cold burger . forgot my onion rings . rude people overall . i do not understand why this place gets any business at all .
american	despite the restaurant being half empty we were put on a wait because our party of 5 was too big to sit . they continued to seat 3 parties of 2 , before i went to ask how long the wait would be . i was told awhile . servers had time to sit and talk but couldn 't possibly be bothered to help us . we left and enjoyed the kona grill for lunch .
american	10 minutes to get drinks , while one server just walked around very dirty looking and not helping take orders . food is to average for poor service !
american	the fist time i had the rudest waiter with absolutely no personality and the second time i waited forever for everything ! i waited to be seated in a close to empty restaurant because the host was mia , i waited forever for my drink order , waited forever for the waitress to take my order , waited for my appetizer ( which was served cold with my food ) and was confronted with an attitude when i chased the busser down who kept passing my table by , to ask for a refill . they should really rename this place the wait ! needles to say , i will not return for this cold food , rude staff and long wait time !
american	got me on hold on the phone for 13 minutes . i got there with the phone still on hold and nobody apologized . the girl just said , ' " my bad . " won 't come back . much rather use the lake pleasant location . the manager was standing right there and didn 't say a word .
american	we ordered pancakes , and when they finally got there we noticed they were the same ones they were offering at the buffet ( mini pancakes ) . taste was ok but didn 't make up for the negatives . expensive and lousy , would not go back and don 't recommend it at all .
american	i only would have given it a 2 because its nice to look at . but its way too hyped . if youre going to do fancy and simple do it right . its quite pricy for the portions . and i think that any place that specializes in meat should at least cook a med rare steak right ? and we got a charcuterie thinking it was going to be good . but the pate was not spreadable and everything was flavorless and tasted the same . bleh ! ! ! ! ! lastly open kitchen means i can see your asses eating from the service station . i saw ever server , runner , and busser stuff thair face and then not wash their hands .
american	i sat there for thirty minutes without even being acknowledged or brought silverware . one waitress ran from pos to pos while the other followed completely flustered . people had to chase them down to pay the check . can 't review the food cause i barely even got a menu .
american	service is slow . food is below average . prices are on par with downtown restaurants . wait staff - nice and pleasant but unfortunately even when it 's not busy , they are very slow at getting orders in . been here a few times now . the location is convenient to us and due to its convenience friends ways suggest a bite there ... unfortunately , this place is banking on that . the food and service doesn 't have to be great because the crowd will always want somewhere close by . it 's disappointing .
american	it took 45 minutes for our food to arrive . my medium rare steak was so tough my knife bounced off it . grilled cheese was congealed ... it was gross . waitress never came over to say kitchen was backed up . it was also so cold with the a / c on that i had to order tea to keep warm . manager did come over once summoned and was really no help . avoid if possible .
american	not just our waitress , other tables around were equally as frustrated with their waiters . the food was just ok . i got a wrap and the avocado was old . i do have to say the hash browns were very good ! the prices were awful ! complete rip-off ! save your money and go somewhere else !
american	one of our friends was told he had a fake id and is 23 . they bent his id in half and called the cops . hour and a half later the cops confirm its real , management refused to come out and apologize nor give us anything for wasting our time . will never be back there again .
american	i requested a 3 meat plate ... got 2 . only one rib in the other one ? ? ? they said it was due to weight . so we just share a rib ? also .. shareable salad is a small cup of salad . never again ...
american	we ran out of our tiny juice drinks in a second and we were holding our hands up for 20 minutes and still got no attention . breakfast is so-so , portions are big , coupons are just a joke .
american	awful service , overpriced food , bad draft beer selection , catch of the day wasn 't even available ? oh and it gave me food poisoning for 8 hours the next morning
american	had initial round of cocktails , but then didn 't see our server until the check was ready . bacon was raw on my burger and when it was brought to the staff 's attention , they said " oh " and walked away . we finally had to flag down a bus boy to bring us water . check came to $ 81 , and the server thought he did us a favor by comping a coke . puh-lease .
american	75 people in lobby waiting while wait staff stand around . 1 plate of food for our party comes out while others wait . cashier checks our card out before we can give tip . waitress scowls because my son does not reach out to take plate from her . why did i pay 48.00 for this abuse ? awful in every way . do not go here . i gave 1 star only because the software requires it . denny 's owes me money and an apology .
american	poor management . food was decent but not worth the experience of dining there .
american	rip off management charged us for games we did not play and charged extra when we asked for another side of sauce . the fries were cold and soggy even when we asked for fresh ones and the strawberry milkshake tasted like it was mafe from water not milk . this location sucks !
american	rude server . our family waited 20 minutes for our breakfast orders before we decided to walk out . manager defended her slow kitchen and tried to justify why another family of five next to us who seat down after us got served before us . overpriced too . skip citizen and to the buffet if at mandelay .
american	sat down and ordered drinks ( coffee and water with lemon ) , the sugar on the table was out and my water came without lemon . after finishing a cup of coffee , the cup had a ton of coffee grounds . the food was okay but nothing special . asked for a refill for my water and coffee after waiting and then waited 10 more minutes , while my waitress walked by 4 times after , i finally put both cups on the edge of the table . our waitress never even asked how everything was after bringing our food . won 't be back , not worth it .
american	came with my lady friend for a late night meal . took at least 15 mins for a server to come to our table . he forgot to bring us water until i flagged him down . time between him greeting us and getting us our waters , 30 mins . manager came up to is to ask how everything was while we were eating but too little too late i 'm not one to make a scene . this place is slow and careless but that seems to be the trend at any bww . don 't expect much from this place .
american	stated couldn 't split a 6 person check because he couldn 't remember what each of us ordered .. when we labeled them for him still got it wrong . manager was no help stated that he just wanted us in and out and he didn 't even apologize for the issue plus he was wearing diamond earrings with a tux . if i want to go to a nice restaurant and have a $ 300 bill i shouldn 't have to deal with bad service and will take my business elsewhere .
american	the beer selection is great , but i was empty on beer for about 20mins . i tried multiple times getting the bartenders attention . it wasn 't until i was about ready to walk out that i got attention . hell , the bartenders thought i paid already . anyways , horrible service which left me to leave a $ 0 tip . tessa was our server according to the reciept . place should be closed down anyways for scaming a local charity .
american	the halibut tasted like it was a warmed up frozen dinner .
american	there were only 5 people in the whole place n the barista never called for out coffee . had to go n ask if this was mine. so obviously coffee was cold . didn 't apologize nor offered another coffee . my friend had been there twice before n said got the same shitty service last toe times too . guess they are not getting our money again
american	they need to do some training with their front of the house staff . rude lady named april taking orders . she was condescending when i had basic questions . for being new to the neighborhood you would think they would welcome people inside their establishment . food is overpriced and bland . barely anyone inside the place . i hadn 't heard anything positive but wanted to see for myself . way better places to have a sandwich and salad at ... don 't waste your time on this one . i would rather go to any fast food joint than this place .
american	they were cleaning to close the kitchen at 8 on a sunday night . i hurriedly ordered hot wings , which were deep fried wings covered in frank 's red hot . then they basically ignored me while i ate and made me feel like i was interrupting their closing procedures . bad experience . don 't go !
american	took over 20 minutes to take our order ( abel was our supposed ' waiter ' ) then it came out about 40 minutes later burnt ! awful service , disgusting food ! we ended up leaving when we saw our food since the bacon was burnt beyond repair and the omelette looked less than appetizing . i 've gone to other ihop locations that are much better in serving their customers ! avoid at all costs ! !
american	waited for almost 30 minutes . if i could rate less than 1 star i would . waitress working night shift with dark hair . did not serve us kept looking at us , all menus closed .
american	when i get here they say it 's gonna take 30 minutes ! ! maybe if you picked up the phone i wouldn 't have to sit here with my activated and hungry child and wait for my pizza to be done .
american	waited over 20 minutes after being seated . not a single server approached our table to take drink orders or anything . dean , manager at time , was awful and had no resolve to the situation .
american	waiting for 10 minutes after i was seated and then had to get a server myself . then was just asked if i was ready to order no drinks no silverware or anything . also the host sat us at a dirty table . just took a cup off and sat us down didn 't wipe it off or anything . the food was good and warm still but the service was absolutely awful . also after contacting the manager that we were sitting for 10 minutes and hadn 't had any service he asked a server to come over and said " i already have a table " awful management . awful service . i would have rather went to mcdonald 's
american	want some bread , or a glass of water ? you 'd do better to run to jack in the box and come back . the food is good , but i won 't be back . honestly , i 've had better food at much lower prices too .
american	service was terrible . food was even worse . would not come here ever again . i 'm disappointed . it 's part of the outback chain so i guess i shouldn 't be surprised ? sad because this place used to be good i heard .
american	we had to flag down a server to get water . food was mediocre , and took forever . order a medium rare burger , and it 'll come out well done . never coming back
american	we had to wait 35 minutes to get a table when there were so many visible open tables another 20 minutes to have water brought over . 15 minutes for a drink order and 30 for sandwiches . awful experience . terrible service , overpriced food . $ 15 for a sandwich . close to that much for a basic 2 egg breakfast . do yourself a favor and skip this place . there 's a buffet a little ways away that you 'll enjoy so much more .
american	we ordered brunch for 3 and waited for over 50 minutes before canceling . when we asked about our food , the cook yelled at us and told us to go to ihop . i 'll never go back .
american	we 've walked out twice due to poor service or wauring 15 minutes before being waited on .
american	we waited about 15 min til the server came and asked us for drinks then another 10 min before we got our drinks then another 10 min before he asked us for our order then 20 min til we got our burgers . then he never came back til he said he is leaving and we needed to pay so we did . we stayed finishing up our drinks and 3 more friends showed up and a new server came and i asked her for water and she tell us we needed to go to the bar and do all our orders there and never brought me my water i needed .
american	we went when it was slower , sat and waited 15 minutes , with no waitress ever stopping by to even take our drink order ! finally we just left and as we were leaving , the hostess that seated us , told us goodbye , really ? ? ? on the floor we saw 4 waitresses , not including the bar waitress , wandering around , no excuse for one of them to not coming by to at least take our drink order . we will not be returning !
american	we work in the same building so this would be a very convenient choice if the service weren 't so bad . wait 10mins to be seated ( not because it 's busy but b / c no one is at the front door ) , get served if you are lucky ( you usually have to go to the bar yourself ) , and wait a min of 1 hour for food . try some of the other restaurants in the area like 3 brewers .
american	we ordered a 12 piece family meal , pulled up to the window and ( silly me ) decided a coke sounded good . the kid at the window says " my manager said i can 't do any add-ons at the window . " are you kidding me ? ! never had a business turn down my money before ... so we get our food and get home , no utensils , no napkins and the meal is all dark meat . 6 drumsticks , 4 thighs and 2 wings . very sloppy , take your money somewhere it 's wanted and appreciated folks .
american	rude . noisy we could not talk to each other without screaming . food was brought out separately so we ate one at a time rather than eat cold food together . hostess was a smart butt the food was good as was the wine but offset by bad service and atmosphere . avoid at all cost
american	food was tasty and was the only thing that came in a decent amount of time . then , we waited for another 10-15 minutes with our plates still in front of us for our check , before we went to the front to pay . of course the server said " i was just going to bring your check " of course you were , would have been nice about 15 minutes prior . needless to say , we will not be back , it 's not worth your time or money .
american	so not impressed ! ! i had the chicken noodle soup and a sandwich . i honestly thought for the price it would be a bigger portion or like have some kind of magic deliciousness to it that would make it worth it . nope . i might as well of opened a can of progresso and a can of chicken at home . so disappointed . never would i recommend . service was bad as well .
american	staff is rude and disrespectful . their sammies aren 't even good . i shutter at the thought of ever going near that place .
american	i don 't understand how people can give good reviews because the portions are huge ? i 'd rather have a regular or small sized portion of decent fresh food than this sorry excuse for food ! the onion rings were ok , the rest was horrid - obviously from frozen huge chicken cutlet . no excuse for this place to stay in business unless they make huge improvements - primarily quality of all meal ingredients and a real cook .
american	standing in lawn and garden today at 1 : 30pm while one employee watches another employee check people out . really ? is there any cross training at this store ? the line is 5 people deep and the " greeter " just points to the line--- doesn 't even speak when asked if he could check any of us out . rude . would give zero stars if possible .
american	blue cheese salad was poorly executed . horrible service even if they are scantily clad . when i talk about houstons to friends i normally say " an upscale hooters " in relation to the waitresses wardrobe as well as the quality of the food .
american	had to call a total of 10 times ( put on hold and never picked up , busy line , no answer , etc ) . food was supposed to be ready in 10 , it 's been 30 mins . still waiting .
american	burger was diner chain level. little to no flavor and the server recommended both to us. yuck. atmosphere was not fully there. all the stuff going on seemed lazily done and sort of in poor taste . if you 're gonna be risque then make sure you go big with it ..
american	terrible beer selection . mildly passable beer selection . oddly condescending service . if your local county fair is the vibe you go for , this place is for you . otherwise , go anywhere else but here .
american	terrible service ! very slow , takes forever for the food to come out even when there 's barely anyone in the restaurant . inconsistent meals when ordering as a group . no dessert menu . when you tell the manager about the issues , she responds with " yah the kitchen 's been kinda slow lately . " came here a few weeks ago for a work lunch , not my choice . felt very sick all afternoon . came here again today for a work lunch , should have declined , and still the same issues , nothing improved since the last complaints were voiced . my cheesecake was served on a broken dish today . someone shut this dump down .
american	the beer was the only thing that was good . the service sucked and the food was eh ok . it took 25 mins to get my food . when i got my food , they got it wrong . i had to wait another 25 minutes for them to get it right . the manager only gave us a $ 5.00 coupon . come on , they could have at least took off my dinner . ridiculous !
american	the burger was preformed and clearly just a frozen patty that was fried . i don 't mind paying $ 2 extra for fries , but give some fries for my $ 2 . though the fries were the only thing tasty thing they served . even the soda was flat . bland , flavorless patty . if you are in the miracle mile shops and want a burger , go to blondie 's instead .
american	the food is at best mediocre however , today we went in because mom likes it and they tried to seat us at a high top with granny who can barely walk , a toddler and two 9yos , so we asked to be seated near a bathroom for medical reasons and they put us in a booth that might as well have been in tucson for its proximity to the bathroom . they then said we could move for the third time , by then it was a waste of time . i ate nothing and half the leftovers that the rest of our party had are going to the dog . absolutely disgraceful service . longhorn , all is forgiven
american	the food is average but service and detail are very lacking . as a frequent flyer , i 've visited this location probably 5 times , but today will likely be the last . understaffed , overpriced and lacking in almost every way . i witnessed the manager and wait staff scrambling around the restaurant in a sad attempt to keep up . and there was probably only about ten tables full , less than half the restaurant .
american	the prime rib was dry and cold and tough . yuck . service was slow and inattentive . we won 't be back .
american	the vegetables in my omelette were frozen , the " home fries " were mushy , resembling mashed potatoes . the blueberry muffin tasted like something i would buy at circle k. yah , the portions are huge , but if the food is terrible , who cares how much you get , i left it on my plate ! don 't think i even want to try lunch here ....
american	the salad bar was the only thing i could eat . food is the lowest quality i 've ever seen at a buffet . stay far away from this dump .
american	the staff here is a joke . made a reservation a week in advance for a group of 10 people for a bachelor party . they gave away our table as we were waiting and were forced to wait another hour as other groups arrived and were seated promptly . definitely ruined the one group dinner event we had planned and did a good job of making us feel as if our business did not matter .
american	the steak was raw ! not rare but raw ! ! ! they tried to grill it again to a medium but it came out again as rare ! the only reason why i 'm giving them a star was because the service was good . we don 't think we will ever be back .
american	the worst dinner i 've ever eaten in madison ! would you like some salt with a side of salt ? out of regular sized hamburger buns ! and sweet potatoes ! the worst thrown together portobello sandwich ever , not to mention the cheese curds were mostly breading ... do not waste your time unless you want to sit around listening to anarchist hipsters ! ugh
american	they cannot make irish coffee whatsoever , another friends drink was beyond tart and undrinkable , and another had gum on his chair and got it on his hands and his pants . the front reception lady did nothing but apologized for it . it just seemed like the staff attitude was careless .
american	awful , they do not wear gloves when preparing foods they put aluminum foil on the sandwiches when you cut the sandwich the aluminum foil gets in the sandwich they do not wear gloves , gross and unhealthy .
american	they were out if nearly everything . if you are accustomed to a high end restaurant ala morton 's or delfriscos you will be sorely disappointed . the entire evening was weird , the food simply topped if off !
american	they would do better to just serve beer and nothing else . overpriced and tasteless food . if you have to watch your diet for health reasons forget it , there is nothing here for you , on the other hand if you want to speed up your heart attack this is the place go . if you go there thinking you will just have a beer and enjoy a nice ambiance than think again , the seating and whole building design is akin to a school cafeteria , to make your unhealthy , expensive , experience just that little bit more uncomfortable .
american	this place is packed ! if you want to get into a movie you have to show up at least an hour and a half before . the seating is awful , bench table with office chairs . the food is expensive and disgusting . if you want a great movie dine in experience go to the amc esplanade .
american	to call this a steakhouse is laughable . best i can say is mediocre over priced nursing home food . staff approached us as if we were lucky to be there . went with pre teens , too noisy to chat and not a one in my party enjoyed their food . waste of time and money .
american	we waited , while we saw many empty tables , and the wait staff scurrying around the restaurant serving customers . after about 10 minutes , we were finally told that the entire dining area was reserved and the bar area is full , so that would a 30 minute wait . we left . may i suggest primantis , post a notice on your front door , that half the place is unavailable , so i don 't have to waste my time to find out the bad news . ! ! ! ! thank you
american	took 10 minutes to see a sign of a bartender . ordered a steak . steak tasted like the cook grilled up a patty of ground beef well done . my side of mash potatoes came in a plastic to-go cup with a lid ( this wasn 't a to-go order ) ... and to top it off the pen they gave me to sign my bill and tip them with had no ink . here 's a tip ... get new management now cause this place won 't survive .
american	took us an hour and a half to get our food .... they bought us terrible food which is of course not their fault but when we called about getting a replacement or our money back they were extremely unhelpful and rude .
american	tragic . like an episode of dance moms exploded . the kj is rude and condescending . save yourself the bother . go to flex go to spotlight go to eagle go anywhere but here . sad because this bar used to be awesome . not sure what it is now .
american	two burnt slices of pizza and a can of soda was 6 bucks ! when i realized that i could get a 16 " pizza for 8 bucks vinnie ( the poor example of a manager ) said " its to late ! " he was rude and when i said i 'm going to write a review about this terrible experience he said " do what you gotta do ! " never again ! also he changes the prices and cant give you a legit receipt . stay away from this place . youve been warned !
american	this restaurant has a great concept , about 15 different grilled cheeses to pick from however i was so disappointed how terrible the food was . i ordered the fried green tomato grilled cheese with tomato soup & sweet potato fries . the grilled cheese was so greasy , the fries were soggy & the tomato soup was canned campbell 's soup or some generic brand ( come on , they can 't make a tomato soup from scratch ) . i could barely eat it , i didn 't even eat half & couldn 't finish . service was just ok . didn 't have the cleanest feel either . very disappointed ! do not waste your time or money eating @ the yard .
american	waited an hour , my omelette was cold , and my kids pancakes were not fully cooked ( batter was still visible in places ) . hope nobody gets sick !
american	waitress sucked ! took her 10 minutes to get our drink order .. food was worse . waitress was sure quick with our check .. don 't know why , she didn 't get a good tip . stay away ! ! !
american	it was clear that we were racially profiled . it seems the south has yet 2 accept they lost 2 the yankees . they received 1 star only because i would not have been able 1 post w / o it
american	was so looking forward to this experience and left unimpressed . the service was slow and the waitress had no desire to be there . when we finally got our food things were mixed up and super cold , so we ended up sending half of it back . also no one who worked there had ever met any of the wahlburgers so it 's not the ' family experience ' i had imagined . i 'll stick to the tv show but my hope is shattered .
american	biscuits and honey butter = dry dry dry biscuit butter was good and had some cinnamon in it grilled corn = delicious , best part of the meal ( sad ) bbq chicken = very moist , pretty good , saucy i came here for tender , meaty , saucy ribs and was sadly disappointed . visit this restaurant if you like jerky ribs and dry biscuits .
american	we had heard great reviews so we gave it a try . the toppings were not fresh tasting or well prepared . we threw the pizza in the garbage and had upset stomachs from the small amount we did eat . normally not picky and practically a crime to thow out pizza in our house . stay away from this place unless you like overpriced yet gross tasting pizza
american	went there even though the reviews were bad . ordered a bloody mary. mix and vodka . no salt and pepper . no horseradish . no nothing except a piece of celery that look like it had been chewed on . the bartender was dumb and clueless . the " manager " didn 't see anything wrong with it . we love to explore and support local places but we had to walk out . very disappointed .
american	stood at the bar waiting to order a drink when the first bartender rudely said , someone is sitting there . i said we just want a drink . she walked away , another person came over asked what my brother wanted and walked away and never got it for him . needless to say we left and walked across the lot to press box . bes decision we made all night . they are nothing like the south park location .
american	we should have known this woul be a bad experience when there was no one to seat us and we had to go find someone . it took a long time to get our food and when it came it was horrible . the eggs were sour and the french toast was burnt . the table next to us never got drinks or their order taken so they got up and just left . i would recommend staying far away .
american	we had hoped to enjoy happy hour here but after 10 + minutes , no greeting , no server , no nothing . we asked at the bar and were told to " have a seat ; someone will come over . " no apology , nothing . life is too short . we walked out and went to lazy dog who appreciated our business very much .
american	wife wanted to eat here so i stopped . i asked for chicken sandwich with no tomatoes and it came with tomatoes . asked for unsweetened tea and it came out sweet . went inside they refilled it but it was still sweet . they did this three times before i said forget it give me dr pepper . then the rest of that night i was on the toilet with food poisoning .
american	will never come back to this place again cornbread was so dry sucked up all my saliva - okra nasty , collard greens had zero seasoning , fried chicken was bland ... even the damn biscuit was dry . the only thing that was decent was the mac and cheese . gumbo sucked cheap with the meats ! if you want some real real good cajun food : cajun queen is your place ! ! ! anyway so we paid and left the kings kitchen and we are now here at rock bottom to eat ... again ... so pissed !
american	will never eat there again ... nothing is fresh ... applesauce from a jar , the burger i had came out of a metal tin sitting on the flat top grill and it was dripping wet ... gross . sitting at the counter is a scary experience ... i witnessed raw bacon sitting on a dirty rag .... enough said .
american	burger was edible but in no way tasty ... fries were not edible . very old fryer oil that needed to be changed weeks ago was used to cook my fries . i am appalled that these jokers cant even make an order of edible fries . do not waste your money or time here . to the owners of blu do us a favor .. shut the doors .. stop serving up this awful food to your elderly customers . you should be ashamed to own this business . i read the bad reviews and tried it anyway .. mistake .. the bad reviews are right .
american	awful worst native i 've ever been to undercooked food and barely sauced wings and strips staff is not apologetic won 't be coming back
american	terrible service explains a huge empty bar beside a baseball stadium before a game .
american	everything was over done , over salted or bland . they definitely cater to the senior set that have no taste buds left . don 't even waist your time or money .
american	i stopped with a friend today for a quick dinner and we each bought an uncle burger with a combo . i used a 3.49 uncle burger coupon but i didn 't realize that i was charged full price for the fries and soft drink . apparently if you use a coupon you don 't get the combo discount . but nowhere in the restaurant did it state that the combo is not available when coupons are used . this is quite misleading and even the staff agreed . one cashier said they always get complaints about this issue but there is nothing they can do . this is not about the dollar that i was overcharged but it is all about the principal .
american	b- what kind of a restaurant has 4 tables ? c- even with the wait the food wasn 't that great .. please stop hyping up places that have mediocre food ! ! ! !
american	the person at the register could not get the credit card machine to work , we offered to pay cash instead she said she could not complete the transaction because of the credit card machine issue . we left and ran a couple errands when we returned the issue had been resolved , and that pizza was fantastic . we decided to again try the daily special last night which was the large pepperoni , that was not good at all . honestly we have had better frozen pizza . we won 't be ordering pizza here again .
american	" the fact that you have to line up like cattle , be presented mediocre , uninspired breakfast and then be rushed out the door makes for a very lacklustre experience overall .
american	i 've had better vegan pizza at other parlors . seems like there was only one woman 's and one men 's restroom so you would have to wait in line on a busy day . not practical .
american	that sums it up for me . i liked the study of duck but my server seemed to be on another planet ! it 's menu is tasty but the one time i visited it just didn 't seem like everything was running together .
american	taking up a good store front for another bar / restaurant in the south side . avoid the franchise crap .
american	" i wish that wise man was with me at the time , because this was so true with chippy 's : it looks fantastic from outside . but later on you discover that the giddy feeling you had before entering the premise disappears fast because , well to put it frankly , the food is shit . the fries sat around for too long , the coleslaw is served in a cup that dental hygienists use to feed you fluoride , and the fish itself is as bland as chewing on a generic flavourless meat . this fine looking establishment needs less focus on ascetics and more on the food .
american	the dressing on the reuben was excessive and way too sugary sweet . the bowl of coleslaw looked as if someone had taken a couple bites and sent it back . they forgot the mustard on the corned beef sandwich ( it 's in the menu description ) . the matzoh ball soup was kind of nice . really overpriced .
american	is the best way to explain this place . we went there at about 230pm on a saturday . it was not busy . the bartender said hello then walked right by us to talk to the wait staff . he kept talking to them while attempting to take our order . the wait staff hung out by the bar and bashed their customers the whole time . i 'm amazed this place is in business ... didn 't try the food and we didn 't dare ... also , kinda weird that you have to walk through the kitchen to use the bathroom .
american	awkward server overly salty shrimp and polenta poached eggs on a benedict that were served hard boiled under seasoned benedict big disappointment
american	this is the restaurant that your weird aunt opens when your uncle leaves her an insurance settlement . not good for vegetarian wife , i was not interested in their attempts at creative entrees . fair to above average choices for draft beer , did not notice cocktails ( would not trust a bartender who wouldn 't have left this middling restaurant in the first place ) charlotte needs enticing , come-as-you-are dining ... fran 's aims to do this and whiffs .
american	my husband and i dropped in this morning for breakfast - we both agreed this was basically a denny 's . that said , our server was wonderful . i think she 's the bartender too . our drinks were great ! ! this lady was fun , outgoing , just amazing . wish we 'd liked the food so we could go see her again !
american	the actual space looks way better since they remodeled , but the menu has jumped in price , but fallen in quality and quantity , and for some reason , the dirty chai was not as good as i remember it being . also , they stopped making their own muffins . now they have those huge , come-in-a-pack-of-25 ones from costco , and overcharge for them .
american	they cook their burgers to medium rare ( which imo is not high enough for minced meat ) and then they immediately drop it on a soft bun . what you 're left with is a soggy wet mess since all the juices have left the meat and have absorbed fully into the bun . it 's not a well composed meal and it 's also too expensive compared to what you can get elsewhere .
american	you are in downtown tempe with so many good restaurants . we found the service slow even though it was not crowded . ( hint : a restaurant with no patronage when you visit is a tip to keep moving . )
american	baby staff , running around with the restaurant half full . first hostess dressed in lingerie , unfriendly . food below par . waiter disappeared for 20 min ; asked to walk to the bar to pay with credit card ; handed over a tiny styrofoam container for me to pack the food . the restaurant was cold and drafty . nothing good to say about it . maybe that it 's a five star mcdonald 's . true . do not go ! better sevice , food and environment for the same money somewhere else .
american	this is by far the worst mcdonald 's in the city . lines are always long , food is a hit or a miss and the management rip you off when trying to use the mcdonalds app . i had an awful experience today with the manager and i do not know if i will ever return to this location . be warned
american	i ordered the negroni and the famous mac and cheese with ham , my friend ordered the taco salad and the thyme lemonade . the drinks were honestly pretty bad ... would not recommend . the taco salad was your average salad and the mac and cheese was your average mac and cheese ... with ham . total after tax and tip was over $ 85 . i wanted to love you gabardine , but alas , it was not meant to be .
american	i hit pink 's everytime im in la and its always bomb.com , but this was sub par and not really good at all . they didn 't have have a lot of the fun options that the pink 's in la has and it didn 't taste like anything special . it honestly tasted like greasy , nasty like stadium food ... wouldn 't stop here again next time im in vegas .
american	me and kids ........ 3 meals , 3 let downs . figured it was going to be awesome . place was packed . i ordered the tuna melt and asking if it was a good sized sandwich . the waitress assured me that it was a good size , then she recommended the chips over the fries . i got fries and i had to peel apart the bread to make sure there was tuna inside . i ended up with a tuna wish sandwich ......... i wish there was more than a spoonful of tuna in my sandwich . wont be back .
american	the macaroni and cheese is a dressed up watered down kraft special . they did have good drink choices - jamaica , strawberry lemonade , lemonade and the regular sodas - the dessert bar was also lacking - poorly cleaned grapes jello and sugar free chocolate whip ? ? ? really - they do have a potato bar - which is very awkward to use but offers the basic boring toppings - such an opportunity waisted - come on sweet potato do better !
american	i ordered a burger with no pink . after a 25 minuette wait i received a very rare burger with blood coming out . against my better judgment i sent it back . what a big mistake , i got back a significant smaller burger that was my original with the bitten part trimmed away a nuked in a microwave . they didn 't even take the time to toast a new bun or put new bacon on it . smh i wish i could give less than one star .
american	i had to order two of double cheese burgers to get filled .... sorry ny you got nuthin on california in n out . the taste was good but ... sorry still in n out kick your ass ... the bun was the stand out ... the fries ... ok ... still won 't compare ... lol the shake ... ok different and kewl ... but i usually don 't get shakes from in n out ... sorry but in the burger race ... in n out is king smash burger the queen and you guys .... a knight in dull armor ... sorry honest the price almost $ 50.00 for the 3 people ..... ouch ! ! ! ! ! ! probably never again ... sorry
american	then things changed . selections and quality dropped . in an effort to save money , ocb started having single serving items , such as pot roast , sit undera heating lamp . the pot roast is so dried at that it has the texture of jerky . items are not replaced in a timely way . service continues to be their shining star . what a disppointment this has become . if there was a golden corral in arrowhead i have no doubt ocb would have to shut their doors .
american	over the past year , every time we go there for lunch there seems to be a different procedure for getting your food ( i.e. where you get the bowl , new menu every few months , etc ) . the rewards program has become a joke . the freshness of the vegetables has gone downhill , to the point where i pass on some of them now . service remains good . i feel like the company is being badly managed on a corporate scale . i just hope it doesn 't get to the point of subway where they sell fake food like " turkey based ham , " that was the last time i spent money at subway ...
american	tonight we came with her two daughters and had a vile experience . the steak was horribly fatty . the ranch had lumps . the broccoli was actually moldy . we showed it to the manager lisa . she acknowledged that it did not look fresh . she squeezed out an apology . she comped the dinner . i can only hope that a little girl does not get food poisoning later . consider yourself warned . oh yeah . the service completely sucked ! ! !
american	we were here on a wednesday night : the music was great outside on the patio , only reason i gave a 2nd star . our server holly was great too , but clearly over extended . the burger that arrived barely resembled the description on the menu ( see photo ) . management , please get your shit together .
american	the service was great , the drinks were to die for and the food was yummy ... or maybe by time my friend and i got there we were just toooo drunk and it seemed good ? a few days ago i went back ... the service = awful ! the food took longer then 20 mins . ( note : they were not busy ) the burger = still yummy but disappointed that it did not come with fries . the stripdog = gross ( note : i did not eat this , my friend tried it and asked me to add it to my review )
american	unfortunately it has come to be very disappointing in there food preparation and freshness of the their food. especially when you get carry out . the cobb salad looked it was thrown in with lots of left over lettuce with bits of pieces from other trashed food , and the the mac and cheese taste old and i " m skeptical about getting food poisoning . sorry but my health and money are worth
american	the service was slow . nearly impossible to get a drink refill even after asking 2 people 3 times . the food was cold in the middle . looks like village inn has become nothing better than a denny 's .
american	the fries weren 't made fresh. idk. pdqs i used to fuck with you guys now im having second thaughts g .
american	this place was no more special than your local denny 's . definitely not worth the 45 minute wait . save your time and eat elsewhere less crowded .
american	and then get a below expectations food , this is your place . service was kind but the wait is not worth it . food was uneventful . enough said .
american	a young man down on his luck sits in the booth at the mcdonalds ask for absolutely nothing one of your staff sees him sitting there and has an issue with this i walk up and tell him i 'm getting him something to eat and the manager said that i don 't care he needs to go now i hope she 's never in that position
american	atmosphere is cool , restaurant appears to be clean . my big pet peeve : they don 't cook their food fresh . why can 't you cook chicken to order for salads ? my chicken was dried out and tasteless ... if you took a few more minutes and cooked food to order and it improve the experience so much ... why do restaurants think they can get away with this ?
american	burgers taste like they were some frozen , preformed patties and the huge bun was time warped from the 80s . where 's the beef ? the ribs were so incredibly salty that i wonder if they brine then coat each rib with sea salt . i gave everyone at my table a rib and they couldn 't finish the one . if this place is 4 stars the there is something wrong with yelp or people have no taste buds . not worth a second visit .
american	az fry guy was the worse fried chicken restaurant i 've been to dry over cooked chicken , tasteless mac and cheese , they forgot the roll , raisins in the coleslaw , i will never waste my money there again .
american	it 's not my fault that you hate your job or your life or both , so i don 't need all of your stank attitude projected on me ! all a sista wanted was a 3 piece ! don 't mean the good michael jackson type of bad , i 'm talkin ' ' bout the what 's that funky smell bad ! the red beans & rice are a joke now , and only the skin is seasoned . i recommend harold 's over popeye 's any day .
american	we came at dinner time . i 'm not sure how long prior dinner had started , but the food seemed like it had been out there for awhile . i 'm really into having my food fresh , and i felt like i was eating food that had been sitting under the heating lamps for a few hours . i 've also had other buffets in las vegas , with many , many , many more choices of food . their selection was small , compared to vegas standards . i can say that we had a very friendly and attentive waitress serving us beverages . i can say the creme brulee was yummy : )
american	my kids and i love this place , great specials on monday night , but we go there on other days as well .... pizza is good , spaghetti and meatballs rock the kids world , salads are presentable and edible ... but the calamity at the entrance is disastrous ! ! ! lets work on this babbo , i 'll be back , , , but with two kids in tow , lets keep it legit .... you guys do your job and i will do mine ! otherwise i will have to stick with take away
american	couldn 't believe it . sides were good and service ok , so some of their staff must have it together . we will not be back .
american	sweet potato fries were too salty ... the dessert was too small !
american	service was certainly not the best . had to flag down my waitress for hot coffee to many times .
american	disappointing buffet selection . for a buffet that boasts itself as the best buffet in the world . the size of the buffet is relatively small and the breakfast option are nothing exquisite . i walked around and tried to convince myself i was missing more areas of food . not worth the cost even for las vegas standards . service was good but the size and availability of the buffet lines and food selection only merits 2 stars at best .
american	slow service the entire time . came recommended and never will return
american	we were seated quickly but the waiters kept walking past us , not even acknowledging us , i made many attempts to get their attention but we were never served not even water was served . we waited well over 15 minutes and decided to walk out because we weren 't going to be treated that way . we got smash burger across the street and it was phenomenal !
american	i order simply . i want eggs . i want toast . i want coffee . i eat eggs almost every day . i know what two scrambled eggs looks like . unless they use grade small eggs , this was not 2 scrambled eggs . toast was warm , but not brown . c 'mon man ! i just can 't bring myself to come here anymore . i 'm over it .
american	ugh this place still sucks ! i really needed a car wash and happened to be driving by ... as typical , the car wash debit machine is broken . but , a nice attendant , mario , did come to help me . the car wash did a decent job and they do a quick hand dry , so i gave them an extra start for that .
american	not good let me tell ya . this time a burger . i expected better , way better . this burger was ordered medium and came out burned and hard and bad as a cinder block . if you know what that is . why would they send that out to someone to eat . disgrace in the back . who is in charge back there . onion soup was so-so . blah . called the manager and told him , they need to do something in the kitchen , because i would really hope they could be better . why , well the environment here is outstanding , a great venue , and the beer is good enough .
american	the entree salads could be considered retro but not in a good way . they are from 1975 with bland flavoring and an emphasis on low cost ingredients . the thai peanut chicken salad in particular comes with tiny shreds of dry chicken buried in a massive mound of white cabbage . the service continues to be lackluster and inattentive -- the food did not come as ordered and came missing relatively important elements like the salad dressing . nothing major but takes time and effort on our part to get fixed . it 's a shame because we do like the red rock hotel and now have to travel off site for casual meals .
american	mastros ' finally wrote back , asked me to give contact information and never got back to us . we are still waiting and it 's now 2017 . we have not been back since . it ruined the dinner . we ended up leaving from just the way we were treated there , and ended up eating down the street at this po dunk place , ' it was a holiday ' and we were highly disappointed in this family reunion . good thing we didn 't hold our breath !
american	wandering around in the strip . used to live in squirrel hill and was a fan of pamelas so stopped in this location for breakfast . in short : cofee - bitter and weak pancakes greasy and salty [ how the hell can pancakes be salty ? ] . corned beef hash ridiculously salty to the point of inedible . service - what service ? total disappointment .
american	my wife and i were very disappointed . the meat was dry , things tasted stale , the desserts tasted like something out of the frozen food section at the grocery store . it was definitely not worth the money . with so many great food options in vegas , including many great buffets , this one should be skipped . you can tell the management is skimping , and that 's very disappointing for what was once a great place .
american	yesterday , a chili cheese dog was a supermarket frank with canned , soupy chili and a tab for $ 7.85 ( root beer in a styrofoam cup included ) . atmosphere ? none . stuck-on mirror tiles with gold particles ? aplenty .
american	now , i won 't eat there again . the wings were a slimy disgusting mess and the chicken salad tasted rancid . i love the bldg and the fact that it 's been a part of this city for a long time , but it hasn 't been kept up . the carpet really needs to be replaced . the whole place just seems dirty and just makes me think there 's a ton of roaches .... i can 't speak for the chili but even the mac and cheese just isn 't the same anymore . i miss the lupie 's from way back in the day . now , i 'm just scared to eat there .
american	i was excited to try it again but was very disappointed . i enjoyed eating the raw rish , but some of the other food didn 't taste very fresh . the meat options were also tough and overcooked . the caviar bar was underwhelming and they limit you to 3 small servings per each visit to the area . as vegas buffets go , for the price i 'd much rather spend my time eating at wicked spoon or bacchanal .
american	again exceeding long wait times to be seated and served . on a different note sassy is awesome !
american	it 's sad , but was probably inevitable . charlie is a terrific cook , but doesn 't seem to have any of the skills needed to run any type of business . i was gobsmacked by the number of people who gave him encouragement , help , and even money , but discipline needs to come from within . i will miss this place .
american	insect traps was a plus . we didn 't get that many insects bothering us . food was decent . the breakfast plate came with a touch of fruit on the side , which is nice to cleanse the breakfast grease . service was terrible though . the waiter wasn 't attentive enough and a tad forgetful ( e.g. asked if we wanted to get the coffee refilled , we answered yes , but he forgot to come by and refilled it ) . the food was not spectacular enough to make up for the less than desirable service . won 't be dying to go back .
american	the food was ok , not worse than before but the experience was dreadful . a coupe seated after us got their good , bill , paid , and left before we were midway through our meal . waiter was barely around . yes they have large groups but all that says to me is that the management is poor and they do not know how to schedule staff . service was so bad the waiter got $ 0 tip . we will not be going back here for quite some time , once again . shame too because they are the only place i know of that has banoffie pie .
american	wish i could go here . " now that i 've moved to a state that has cici 's all around town i thought , " finally . " until .... i came here and tried this place for myself . perhaps i came when they were 2 hours into closing time but their pizzas are not fresh . even though it came straight out of the oven , it tasted like cardboard . i was disappointed . = ( and the pasta ... don 't even bother . very unflavorful and their sauce didn 't taste fresh either . even though it was about $ 5-6 per person ( not including beverage ) , i will not be back .
american	best club sandwich anywhere . then one day we showed up and a big stupid red coney island sign was over the door . absolutely horrid food , terrible service , and filthy nasty . there were bugs everywhere . so sad .
american	the service was friendly , however i ordered a bacon burger to go and there was no bacon ! fries were salty and burger was mediocre at best ! ( could have went to cookout ) . the restaurant was very busy so something must be good just not the burger .
american	more like pork belly from hell . worst protein pancake ever . even the scrambled eggs were bad . probably because they tasted like they were half cooked in the pork belly grease . i love breakfast , but this was not breakfast . also it was kinda weird that all of the waiters were men . at least they had free wi-fi that i had to haggle the password for . it 's " pancakes " by the way ... good luck , but just avoid this place .
american	two bites in she realized she 'd eaten pork ... for the first time in 10 years . the waitress made a slight apology , but didn 't care enough to take it off the bill . adding to that how long it took to take our order , it didn 't leave a good impression . the food was " okay , " about what you 'd expect from a $ 15 - $ 30 burger , but as most recent reviews mention , the service ain 't great . there are better burger joints out here . holstein 's , just off the top of my head .
american	not much flavor or bacon . i had one little piece showing and it was hit and miss in the waffle . also the portion seemed much smaller but more than enough to fill me up . they use a lot of inexpensive ingredients as filler to make the portions seem bigger . my son had the blt and they used thick bread and almost a half head of lettuce to make it appear really large . overall , it 's just okay . i live here and rarely eat at hash house because there are so many places in vegas with a lot better food and atmosphere .
american	how is that possible ? ordered two 1 / 2 blt roast turkey with avocado . received both sandwiches with no avocado . went to the counter to fix my order and the manager katie snapped at my wife saying " for future reference it 's gonna be $ 1.50 for extra avocado , " when it was their fault the forgot the avocado in an avocado sandwich . also , the server guy has very bad short term memory . he brought our food and asked if we need anything else . we said we needed butter . he forgot and never brought us butter . the cashier girl was very nice . 11 : 00am june 20 , 2017
american	who runs out of pancakes in the early morning ? flimsy dry over cooked omelet and gotta say it was the worst omelet i ever had in my life .
american	service sucked . steak was raw . biscuit and gravy was so bad i would not have gave it to my dog . the eggs sucked . everything was shitty . this place should close down asap .
american	food was ok , we expected food to be good due to the cost . the only thing good about this restaurant is the view . we got there at 7 : 30 pm and was out at 9 : 45 pm . salty corn bread , no wine cork service , calamari was fake and chewy , steak was ok .
american	no coffee while waiting - that 's a first at a brunch place . curt responses to every question with a bit of pretentiousness that makes me say , " what did i do wrong ? " perhaps vegas is not used to brunch culture . i cannot recommend this place unless you wanted to be treated like you 're not welcome and they don 't want your business .
american	dont recommend if you want a good experience that is hassle free
american	terrible service . who cares if their pizza is good . lot of great pizza and beer places in lv . they need to get new hostess if they want customers to keep coming back .
american	it was a $ 12 sandwich , which is double than many surrounding shops around for a sandwich , but i paid it because i wanted something special and it was held prominent on their menu as one of the best . however it was not good . i feel like i could have gone to burger king and gotten a better fish sandwich and i font ever eat fast food . to feel like i paid double to get a fast food sandwich i so i am letdown .
american	bad bad atmosphere .... food was aright , service was very fast , the place looked like grandma would come out and welcome you , however not one waiter smiled and barley spoke , they looked mean i felt as though i could be shanked at any moment the atmosphere was very somber and stiff , just came from church and was a real bummer on a beautiful sunday morning .
american	bad ! bad ! don 't waste your time or $ $ $ . this used to be our go to mediterranean restaurant . new owners and the quality has gone way down ! both chicken kabobs were way under cooked , raw in the middle . sauces are watered down . rice is is blah ! salads was unappetizing . pita bread , unexplainable , .... really bad . did i say how really bad this place is !
american	food was bad , waiter was bad . my waiter was slow and preoccupied with a lady at the bar . the manager actually had to get onto him about spending too much time with her . two waiters met in front of my table , hugged , kissed , and parted ways . i really don 't car but i have never scene this kind of behavior in a busy restaurant before . i was very disappointed with this saturday night dining experience , especially when it cost me $ 200 dollars . damn ! i report , you decide .
american	out of calamari , out malbec , out of chocolate cake , $ 13 bourbon , i guess they were out if bacon for my kinda of a wedge salad that had hidden valley ranch dressing as well .. hmmm i would advise a better meal at waffle house !
american	i love other schlotzsky 's but stay away from this location . after ordering our sandwiches we were told they were out if tomatoes ( a sandwich shop out of tomatoes really ? ) then waited in the drive thru and they got the meat wrong for the sandwich so even a longer wait ... got home sandwich was dry and not worth it . epic fail for the second time at this location , i won 't be back .
american	mmmm not bad : terrible ! . the food selection , the quality , the service , everything is really missing in this place . i went because i had a hotel credit for staying there ( which the hotel didn 't honor when checked out ) expecting something good . i knew from the beginning that it wasn 't the best buffet in vegas , but i wasn 't expecting something so bad . the table next to us , was having the same impression about it so it 's not me being picky , it 's just a terrible and totally forgettable place .
american	need i honestly say more ? ? bad service and bad wings ! ! what else would i go for ? ! ? ! ? wings taste like the kroger brand hot sauce . do yourself a favor and go to native new yorker .
american	save your money and go to whataburger ! not even worth the free bday burger we got !
american	poor service . food was barely passable . steer clear of this place . pork chops came out like jerky . asparagus was the size of a spaghetti noodle . ribs tasted like they were microwaved . charge $ 2.75 for drink and they never refilled our table . waitress had absolutely no personality and seemed to hate her job .
american	stood at the bar for 10 minutes and still never got acknowledged . some of the most absent minded bar service there is . food is not worth the price . i know it 's a chain but they could do so much better . chains usually mean some sort of consistently . not here . cross it off your list .
american	the golden coral is better than this place ! ! we were starved when we arrived and between the five of us in the party , we couldn 't come up with one thing that was good . the so called italian sausage and peppers was cheap , dry kielbasa . the only seafood on the buffet were baby shrimp and crawfish - gross . even the salad bar was horrible ! don 't waste your money people ! !
american	waitress did not check on order had to wait 45 mins . just to get a sample of thier bluesmoon bbq sauce . asked for manager and when the manager showed up at our table so did the sample person . the manager had to take our order . while eating my wings i asked the waitress for more ranch and it took 15 mins just to get ranch dressing . the manager was very professional and kept my bad situation under control . but i am still not happy with the overall experience and will probably not go back to this buffalo wild wings .
american	bad . bad . worst buffet i have ever had . overpriced and not on par with the rest of our stay at the cosmo . the presentation was great but they should invest more in flavor of food . not one of the 3 of us enjoyed it . rather than telling each other to try items on the buffet was good we were all sharing things to say how terrible they were . don 't recommend at all . the dessert selection looks impressive but there really isn 't a lot to offer there . never again
american	2pm we walked in ; sign says wait to be seated . three employees saw us yet none even acknowledged us . one female by bar , another female wrapping silverware , and male came out of kitchen - they need customer service training . we won 't be back .
american	slow service . cold food . wouldn 't recommend to families , singles , couples , youth , adults , swingers , church-goers , parents , children , brothers , sisters or most humans . perfect for someone on death row waiting for their last meal , as it will take forever . but , once the food came , it was tasty .
american	bad service , bad food . sucked up hair through the straw of my water ! ordered a beer with the mediterranean chicken pita tacos . waiter disappeared and brought the warm draft beer 30 minutes later and still charged me for it ! the yogurt sauce in the pita tacos was curdled and sour ! had the waiter take it off the bill . manager asked if i wanted another order ? are you kidding ? ! shove it in your pizookie ! !
american	the only reason i left 2 stars and not 1 is that they had a solid eggs benedict ... doubt if i will ever return here .
american	how is it that i can get a better sandwich in the philly airport ( a real city ) for way less money at au bon pain and the staff is friendly also ? i have tried multiple times thinking my last experience was an exception and i am always left disappointed . keep your money , stay hungry and wait until you get to your destination .
american	i would have been ok with the " bar " atmosphere ( since it is a sports bar ) if the food wasn 't gross and service wasn 't bad . i wont ever go back .
american	what more could you ask for . three of us had fish and chips which our terrible waitress said was awesome . i guess she has never had good fish and chips because this was like fish fingers and waffle fries on a bed of wilted lettuce . and it was cold . it took 15 minutes to get a cloudy barely drinkable pale ale . i would never go back to this place , there are just too many better alternatives
american	okay food . attracts a lot of the bro crowd at all times of the day which is kind of annoying if you wish to go here for some reason . expect to receive horrible service if you have the audacity to sit at the bar and are not a hipster or bro or a model .
american	i got a plain bialy from them today for take out . it had the consistency of wonder bread . both my wife and i tasted it and decided we can get better , much better . most bialys i have had are even denser than the establishment 's bagels . perhaps they just had a bad day , but nothing that looks like white bread for me .
american	lukewarm . wife 's bacon was rubbery and cold . they replaced and were willing to replace again , but " it will be the same . the bacon is pre-cooked . " sorry , david burke . this is unacceptable . they did take $ 1.84 off the bill to their credit . appeared to be some argument with manager / staff . server tried hard but could not overcome kitchen shortcomings .
american	if you want a great burger go to in and out ! !
american	came here with a groupon to try the place . we received the wrong food , bill was not corrected because we did not receive correct hamburger ( there are only 3 on the menu ) , and then they refused the alcohol on the groupon even though it groupon includes . no happy hour specials ... would not return .
american	and for some reason i have been back way too many times hoping that they might get it right . not anymore , i won 't go back no matter how convenient it is .
american	no excuse for breakfast place . weak and not hot . food was just okay and very pricey .
american	if i can can no star at all ! the food was late n i have to change it to toast only . but the waiter derrick is great n try to make things better . i gv 5 stars onlyy to him ! the food came after one hour ! so bad ! ! !
american	the only plus is convenience , if you stayed at the hotel . i 'd rather walk to the mc donalds
american	asked what soups they had available at 10 : 30 and you would have thought i asked for a medium rare steak . manager forcefully changed the menu to lunch menu and was visibly frustrated . also when asked what gluten free items they had she only offered one cookie . probably best to order online so you don 't have to interact with anyone working .
american	bad customer 2 people working on saturday night then have older lady working register and she needs help like especially its n casino wow terrible terrible got to do better
american	it took about another 10 minutes before we got our drinks , the water tasted worse than hose water ; and half an hour for our food to come . food was okay however overpriced for the taste . in addition to bad customer service the restrooms were complety discusting . completely dissatisfied !
american	almost everyone had an attitude . never again staying here . not a happy camper .
american	my daughter is gluten free and they would make zero exceptions to their menu .
american	however , the burger itself was nice , and a handful selection of toppings .
american	they should be up to date with the company 's new offers and changes ! very disappointed .
american	bad customer service had to get their attention to get our drinks ... waited over 30 minutes for our check wasnt even packed just us and one other person ... the food was amazing but would get my food togo next time
american	okay i said no problem .. and i waited 15 minutes to get my food .. so i ask him if i were stay at the first widow would i wait 15 minutes. he reply and sais i guess ! ! ! ! lol .. bad customer services and lier ..
american	if your turkey burger was too dry and inedible then you should not be told it 's because you should have ordered a beef burger . some people don 't eat beef ! and you basically confirm that the turkey burgers here are gonna be and suppose to be dry . so don 't order that here ! and if you do , you won 't get a refund ! you have been warned !
american	i 'm visiting from seattle and this was the first meal i had in vegas . food was okay but took way too long to prepare ! expect a 45 min wait for your food , even if you only have 2 people in your party . the assistant waiter , andy was rude too . he looks like he is a reliable worker but his customer service sucks ! bad attitude and outright rude . drops your silverware in front of you in an unpleasant manner . " what ya want ? ! " echoes at every table he goes to . sounds like a duck ... rude daffy not donald . never coming again !
american	never going back ! it took forever to receive our food while other people that got there after us got there food before we did .
american	one of my orders was wrong and on my other order i asked for no pickles , as i ate my burger i could smell pickles , as if it was placed on my burger then taken off . plus they do not give you a receipt of what you were charged for . they wrote our total on a piece of paper . i asked the cashier about it and she said , " we are an old fashioned diner and we are going to remain that way , " with a horrible attitude . the one star is for the tasty onion rings and curly fries . the burger could have been good if they would not have left pickle juice on my burger .
american	i ordered the number three double cheeseburger and fries and small drink . the food was horrible . you can tell everything comes frozen you can taste it . i would not recommend this to anyone .
american	went through the drive thru and ordered a " happy meal " fries without salt and cooked " well done . " what they gave me was a drink filled up half way , fries weren 't cooked as requested and the chicken nuggets came with no sauce . also since when have they started putting happy meals in bags ? ? smh . shame on this location
american	we waited as they served people that came in after us . only half full restaurant . after a half hour we told the manager . no effort to make it right . too many good places in town . go somewhere else
american	slow service , waiter forgot to put in appetizer , over priced . dinner took forever to come out . there is outdoor seating and it was chilly out that night . waiters kept opening the door to go in and out so i was cold as we were sitting near the door . kale was nothing special and i have had better oysters at red lobster . fish was good though . wont be back .
american	bad day here , not really crowded came in got seated and waited , waited and waited for 15 min went and talked to guy at register who was clueless , may have to think about service issues here
american	the veggie wrap my friend ordered was bland and very unexciting . and the bowl i ordered tasted like canned mushroom soup - is it a bowl or is it a soup ? neither of us finished our food ... the service was trite ... one minute i 'm giving my order the next i 'm being ignored ... and then poof , i 'm ordering and then sort of being helped ... abrasively but with a smile ... no thanks .... i totally enjoyed my chai latte ... but probably not going back anytime soon ...
american	didn 't serve drinks in time coffee was cold asked for napkins and never got them i do not recommend eating there at all ? ! ? !
american	extra crispy was not , rolls / biscuits were hard not soft , potatoes normal , gravy cold , tea was day old tasting and coleslaw was great . understaffed , no leader and we most likely will not be back . should have gone to popeyes .
american	tried to charge us for a drink that was sent back because it was not made right and we had to argue with management about removing it from the bill . really surprised by the horrible management of a place that gets good reviews .
american	my french onion soup was awful , salty and flavorless . i dumped it out of my car window after a few spoonfuls . no idea what was floating in it , rubbery cheese and tasteless bread . the hot dog was edible , at least . i will never go to portillo 's again .
american	food is not good . got the skillet which tasted like old chinese food , pancakes were so dry . our server was great however . won 't return .
american	gyro meat was cold and tasteless and the pita was crusty .
american	took 10nin for our server to come take drink order , another 5min to get water and a beer . ordered two burgers , both were okay and somewhat bland . my fiance 's burger was severely undercooked . she sent it back to get one done with ' some pink ' as originally ordered and it came back very ' well done ' with zero pink . server was unapologetic and lethargic at best . manger did take one burger off the tab , so at least they did that correctly . took 15min after clearing table to get our bill . will not be back to red robin for another 2 years .
american	arrived @ 10 : 50am . we wanted lunch . so we asked an employee when we arrived if they serve lunch at 11am . we were told yes . we got in line anticipating at least a 10 minute wait and we were right . so it 's after 11 : 00 . they refused to take our lunch order because they said people behind us in line still wanted breakfast . well , nobody asked us about what we wanted when we were in line . it 's after 11 : 00 no lunch . we left pissed . fu joe .
american	waited an hour and 15 min. after ordering before our food appeared , after a party of 4 at one table and party of 2 at another , both who came in 15 or 20 min . after us were served & eating . i ordered benedict . it was one muffing one egg ( cooked hard ) cut in two , so i got 2 halves instead of 2 eggs . won 't be going there again for a while
american	they had taken off the best burger , the " teddy burger " , a bad choice since it was very good and on menu for decades from fuftie 's ! they now offer a build your own burger with fresh cut frie 's , sounds good right ? wrong for $ 11.00 i got a approximately 5 oz burger with no flaver because no seasoning and the fries somewhat tasted like fresh cut but we 're a substitute from precooked freezer bag ! that 's it for me , done ! tom dean hudson , hio
american	be careful cause the servers would overcharge the tip ! i left $ 8 on cash on a $ 30 check and he added $ 10 on my credit card . try to get in touch with the gm and he was very careless and showed no interest on my problem , then he said was gonna check and be in touch with me to solve the issue and still haven 't heard from him . stop by at the restaurant and he was gone , i called him and he was off , tried again and they put me on hold for 35min . definitely not coming back to that location worst customer service ever ! !
american	blackened salmon sandwich appeared to be made with canned salmon and was overcooked , bun was hard and dry . caesar salad was very good . $ 9.00 for one coke with 2 refills . $ 8.00 for one scoop of vanilla ice cream . service was slooooow and appalling . one star only because there wasn 't a lower choice . too bad , used to be a good restaurant .
american	there are great pizza hut 's and not so great locations . this place gives the crappy ones a bad name . ..... but , they are busy as hell so don 't expect service or quality to change any time soon .
american	food was cold . filet was tough and not seasoned . used to be a good place to eat , but way overpriced for the quality of food . next time will go to ruth chris or black angus . anything would be better . again , it wasn 't about the price , it was about the severe lack of quality .
american	food was salty , gave us the wrong kind of bread . they couldn 't even get the chai right . service is even worse . this explains why there were no indians in this restaurant . will not recommend
american	my wife loved the cake boss show and she wanted to try buddies restaurant . there was hair in my food ( gross ) and the manager gave me some stupid excuse about the company that services the napkins " whatever . " waiter was nice , manager was not pleasant in-fact dismissive about hair in my food . buddy v " cake boss " well-known household name , good reputation in the food / restaurant industry and positioned as high profile fine dining restaurant at the venetian in las vegas . the experience was all but excellent : hair discovered in my food ( gross ! ) and poor presentation of product ( plates were extremely worn ) .
american	maybe it was partially due to the day , and time of day that we dined ( sunday during the day ) . the kid 's personal pizza was basically a slab of dough , with a ton of sauce , and a the smallest amount of cheese that i have ever seen on a cheese pizza . my entrée was awful and i could not finish it . my wife offered me a little bit of her bbq sandwich and it didn 't taste fresh at all . the waitress was polite and the setting was certainly nice enough for a family outing , but the food that day was not good at all . i will not eat there again .
american	then they offered to put us back on the list but it would be another 20 min. we stupidly agreed , 30 min later we gave up and left . it was hot inside disorganized and very frustrating to wait an hour and never even get to sit down . no burger is that good will never go back ! my advise don 't waist your time with this place ,
american	cute place and have gone here plenty of times but since sam is not the manager anymore , the food and service has been getting worse and worse . the prices are high for what they give you but the quality is hardly better than any corner sandwich place . i had the three cheese pasta and it was ok but kind of bland . it 's the last time i go here .
american	i got the turkey and cheese and thought it was just okay . my boyfriend got the " top sirloin " and it was not at all a " top " anything . it looked like dog food . terrible . aside from that , the fries were just meh . the icing on the cake was our terrible server . he didn 't crack a smile the entire time . he messed up my boyfriends order then acted like we were being annoying by pointing it out . we asked later for a refill and he just looked at us and said " okay . " he acted like we were inconveniencing him the whole time we were there . very unpleasant !
american	three of us ordered burgers all cooked the same - medium . mine came late and after i got one bite in , i saw burger was raw on inside . i sent it back . rather than cook a new one they put the raw one back on grill , seared the edges and brought it back . they literally threw it on the table and quickly left table . after a bite , i saw it was still raw at center . i couldn 't get anyone 's attention and my guests were almost finished . staff avoided checking with me again . bad
american	i 've been to smashburger before and liked it , so i wanted to take my boyfriend . we went there on a tuesday night and the burgers were ok . i was very disappointed in the manger ( man in red shirt ) he was just cutting up with staff and worst of all was playing with the red drinking cups ! ehhh had his hands all over them ! soo if you are going to eat here make sure to get a paper cup ! ! !
american	i would rather drink from the allegheny river than their coffee ! long wait , unprofessional staff and their oatmeal is sticky like chewing gum ! yuk ! i would walk a but further to go to pamelas diner !
american	comes with no sides , so i ordered a side ( they forgot to put in in ) . i left hungry after spending a $ 125 for 3 people . never will go back .
american	ordered hell 's kitchen , the farm burger , fries , and onion rings . patty was over cooked and dry . french fries was not fresh they 're were extremely dry . first experience was good , then the second time was the worst . disappointed
american	ordered simple meals two plates of wings , and french fries . the french fries didn 't come out till we were almost done with our meal . we were seated outside on the outside terrace . no one told us you could smoke out there even though there were children and many people eating dinner . some guy sat down right next to us and lit up a cigar ! ! ! ahhhh ! why weren 't we told this ! it was my understanding that in arizona , if food is served at a restaurant , you can 't smoke . we will never go back there again ! the table was sticky too .
american	seated 20 minutes after reservation time with another 10 minutes before greeted by the server . " we 're doing the best that we can " was the only response i could get out of anyone . the iced tea was weak , the salad was overly salted and lacking in pancetta . the pizza was ok but by then , my mood was already soured on the whole thing . i won 't be coming back .
american	service was bad . food was tasteless . waitress was bad with attitude . ended up spoke with the manager about it .
american	sorry . no one clearing tables . slow getting the pizza out . felt like a similar local pizza buffet place and that is not a good thing . probably won 't be back . if this was not enough , a hair on top of my pizza .
american	staff lost our ticket , staff wrote down order and then put the order at the end of the line really . then food came and it was wrong except for kids meals . kids finished eating still no food . i went to counter and they lost it again . i stood at the counter to make sure it was done right . they ran out of tomatoes had to cut more . had to get the sub to go . no apologies nothing from staff . also no coke in machine . total time 1.5hrs for a sub !
american	meal first . rude tourist " cattle car " service from hostess through staff and management . mediocre food at more than mediocre prices . all the people movers to access the property are broken and in one case one direction is blocked . this does not go down well with the well oiled members of the tourist hordes ; lots of negative interpersonal action . one of the interior hallways is also under construction leading to a similar dynamic if you want the indoor square atmosphere with good service you might want to consider spago a food the street at caesars even better food wise and service wise are dcog and scarpetta in the cosmopolitan .
american	there was something wrong with the temperature . we were cold all the night as we couldn 't even take of our coats . i will never go there again unless i hear they have found a way to set up temperature of the room .
american	they put a single diner in a corner table . no server ever showed up . the place wasn 't busy but they just kept walking past the table . no one cared until i left . the bakery is busy but the restaurant needs some work .
american	milkshake was watery . chicken panini was cold and avocado in it was brown / bad . steak salad had cold steak on it and the onions had gone soggy . restaurant was dirty . front door handle broken going out .
american	took us 58 minutes from the time our server submitted our order of a cheeseburger , onion rings , chicken primavera , and chicken fingers for us to receive everything except the chicken fingers . that took another 10 minutes . didnt seem that busy . primavera was dry and the burger was lukewarm . on the plus side , the onion rings were good and the manager ran his butt off . don 't recommend eating there . since then they contacted me two days ago and asked me for my email to attempt to make thing better . still haven 't heard from them . but maybe my daughters chicken fingers are done now .
american	walked by waiting for our table at felice , down the street . while examining the menu posted on the door , the owner / chef walked out and worked very had to convince us to eat there . when we finally agreed , we sat down and waited to place our drink order . and waited some more . there was more wait staff than diners , but we were ignored for more than 15 minutes . the owner / chef sat at the bar , talking to another staff member - i don 't know if he noticed when we walked out . won 't be going back - that place is too pricey to be scrounging at the door / ignoring customers .
american	we had a larger group ( 13 ) but that should not matter . we had one server , travis , who was rude and whose service was terrible . of course our out of town guests did not receive their food when the rest of the group did and we had to get the the manager involved just to finally get the food . it really ruined the meal portion of the night . unfortunate
american	we never got our food and they tried to compensate by free cocktail which my husband and i didn 't want so we fave them another 20 mins to wait on our order but it never came until we decided to leave . we were seated on time by 7p reservation and had an appetizer and waited til almost 9 : 30 for our food . manager came apologize but never corrected the issue . it was so weird and even the waiter apologize got the kitchen forgetting our orders . worst experience will not recommend and go back . i heard two of my coworkers had bad experience too and i didn 't even mention i went .
american	went for happy hour . ordered 2 drinks on what we thought was happy hour and ordered a shared plate from happy hour menu . all was great ! then ordered 2 more drinks after hh ended and decided that we would split a entree and salad . first bill had drinks we didn 't order . then real bill came ..... 94.00 ! ! ! ! really ? come find out my husband 's drink was not on hh . nice of them to tell us . not ! way too expensive for 4 drinks , salad and entree . not impressed at all . second time there and our last . we wanted to give them a second shot .
american	went on a monday and they were out of 1 / 2 of their beers which i didn 't know was even possible . when we got to the food menu , they were out of at least 3 things we wanted . ordered the pig ears and brussels sprouts which were bland and nothing special . fried chicken . was delicious , crispy and moist ( sauce wasn 't the best though ) . don 't think it made up for the entire visit , but at least something went well . decor and atmosphere was great . liked how they had the garage door to open up the restaurant to some fresh air .
american	went through drive thru tonight . asked for kids 6 count nugget kids meal extra fries . she kept having to ask what we wanted . get food . not hot . ordered 6 nuggets only got 3 and instead of extra fries i got apples . r u kidding !
american	the manager expressed his discussion with my group was to kick us out instead of discussing the situation with us .
american	2 hours to deliver ! the only reason we ever go there or order is for the hot chicken sandwich and the last time they screwed that up ! subs and pizza are not what they were years ago . they must have sold it or stop caring . very sad .
american	i had a sandwich and it gave me heartburn . incompetant employees . avoid this place !
american	an hour and a half from start to finish . saw the waiter 3 x total ? wrong food brought out to my bf , ( he ordered a salad ) mom ordered potato pancakes that were burned and rubbery , my order of turkey sliders was ok - not hot , and my fries were missing . $ 53 for 3 lunches and 3 soda ? not for this my friends .
american	do not waste your time or money . i ordered the cuban sandwich and it tasted like it just came from the microwave .
american	bad food and poor service , if it wasn 't for the attractive wait staff they 'd be out of business
american	it took forever for the server to come order our drinks , then forever again to get our drinks ... then forever to get our not so good food ... the group of friends i came with and myself believed out server was high on someting ! hilarious but it does explain the lack of service .. poor service overal .
american	went here during restaurant week with a large group of friends and everyone was disappointed . the service was slow and disrespectful and i 'm not sure i would have fed my rubber steak to the dog . i 'm not one to go out of my way to write a bad review unless the place really deserves it , and sadly this " steakhouse " certainly does due to the quality of food , price and service . don 't do it , try city hall .
american	i don 't think that they like or want customers . we waited for 10 minutes to get seated , another 10 minutes for our waitress to come by and 40 more minutes for our food . no explanation , no apology . i 'm not one who likes to complain but when i mentioned our disappointment to the night manager , he told me that if i didn 't like my experience , i didn 't have to come back . i think i 'll take his advice .
american	bad food bad brad bad salad , knife does not cut meat it just sawed , never went to so bad steak house in my life , please do a favor to your self run away as fast as you can ! !
american	salt seems to be their favorite ingredient . ordered an old fashion and got a whiskey and soda with an orange slice . when i complained manager did nothin to fix . many better choices . skip this one .
american	bad service ( got 2 of our orders wrong and gave us attitude for asking it to be corrected ) . great location . good beer specials . small tvs .
american	heard about this place . cold waffle , servers insulted that i would notice cold food . would never recommend . i see they are building new place in my neighborhood . 32nd and camelback . will tell my neighbors not to bother .
american	saving grace is this place is insanely cheep . 1 dollar domestic drafts when i was there and $ 7 for a burger and fries .
american	bread was more like crackers , mussels were over cooked , shredded pork nachos had almost no shredded pork . seats were uncomfortably hot and management refused to turn misters on . if you like terrible food and hipsters , this is the right place for you .
american	cole slaw and veggies didn 't show up until i asked . unseasoned catfish fingers and shrimp . tips of the rib tips were thinner than a green bean . oh well , i have a $ 100 gift card . guess i will have to buy a box of bbq sauce . well the manager chrissa came by and was so delighted to hear their shortcomings that she comp 'd the meal !
american	dinner for 2 ... $ 117.00 ? for fried and steamed seafood . even the fries wre bad ... old stale . the salads were fine ... but couldn 't make up for the poor seafood ... red lobster tastes with park ave prices .
american	don 't go here . they need to change the menu and make it more vegetarian friendly . i went here twice . the first time i got a dish with quinoa and it was way undercooked . i 'm not a fan of this place and it 's expensive .
american	this place has a nice layout , but the food is not worth the money .
american	i got a to-go of falafel starter and 2 chicken combo platter , and i regret spending $ 35 on this tasteless meal . the pita bread was cold and i opened up the box 5 minutes after getting the food . will prefer greek wraps / king gyros to this place which are economical and tasty .
american	felt like a child cooked my meal .. nothing was fresh . extremely slow service and the prices are high for no reason . don 't go there if you are in to good fresh food .
american	specials suggested by our waiter were really bad . place and wine was ok . i 'm disgusted with the food they serve at this place . i think the restaurant impossible should visit this place and fire the chef .
american	1 salad is edible , the rest i wouldn 't give to an animal to eat .
american	i don 't understand how a barbecue can turn out like this with such a price ! barbecue is bad , either over roasted or too rare , and cold dishes are just salads . basically what we like is the fry banana ... also , with a price of 30 , it doesn 't accept we pay individually ( 20 people ) . are you kidding me ? ! !
american	i don 't think it is a problem with this location . more of a ruby tuesday problem . food sounds good on the menu , but the appearance and taste is poor and has been past 2 times
american	they have a good arabic market but not the restaurant .
american	paid a lot of money and left hungry . only blot on a good vegas trip .
american	they could not find a desert menu , sat at table for 30 minutes before we got food menus , convention n sports people beware . this is the ultimate riip off tourist trap .
american	i would never go there again . might be ok for asu students to go there and have an expensive beer but don 't eat there . don 't order their sliders as there is no meet all white bread .
american	very little selection of food for a buffet and the little food that they do have is not really good at all . the live music is also terrible . it 's ridiculously loud and frankly annoying for a restaurant . the price for dinner buffet is also insanely high at $ 25 or more for bad food and annoying music . will not be coming back here ever again .
american	veggies tasted horrible and were discolored ( brown ) celery . extremely expensive for two burgers and two drinks . the floor was dirty and the table was not wiped down clean . do not eat here .
american	biscuits and gravy were rock hard , couldn 't even cut them . stay away .
asian	this is the perfect small neighborhood sushi joint . come a few times and the staff remember your orders and all you have to do is sit back and enjoy . my family loves this place !
asian	uncluttered sophistication decor and service is stellar . iron chef does it perfectly . makes me want to return to vegas just to have dinner here
asian	the price can 't be beat ... $ 20 all you can eat for dinner ! many appetizers to choose from sushi , sashimi , hand rolls , special rolls . don 't forget about there items from the wok and ramen , udon and teriyaki ... avoid there website it 's old and out of date ! ! can 't wait to come back ! !
asian	i 'm usually skeptical about where i eat sushi but this place was really clean ! they have a lot of sauces also to choose from which i love .. the yum yum sauce is a must try .. it 's like a sweet spicy mayo sooooo good . another cool thing was they had a picture for every roll they serve so you can get a look at it before ordering
asian	i recommend the happy hour all you can eat sushi . it 's worth it .
asian	it 's a great takeout spot when you want to grab a quick , healthy lunch / supper . my definite go-to when i 've got a craving for sushi !
asian	i was told it is imported from la every day . the service is solid and the owner is amazing ! must go if you love sushi .
asian	love the all u can eat . chef n staff are super nice ! great prices !
asian	the environment is upscale but comfortable . it 's a quiet room with a sushi bar . service is quick and friendly .
asian	the waitress was friendly ! bulgogi beef was wonderful ! my sashimi was so great ! quick service ! only came for the weekend , but i will be back later tonight !
asian	we did the all-you-can-eat sushi for $ 20.95 & it included the entire menu unlike most places where it 's limited . service was excellent ! will definitely be back !
asian	the jalapeños are very hot ( i enjoyed it ) . i got the bbq pork sandwich with a fried egg ! definitely would get it again . the fried egg really brings it together . yummy . the ingredients tasted fresh and the sandwich is a big size . definitely filled me up !
asian	fresh , tasty thai food & it won 't break your wallet ! great value , great portions . i originally ate at the restaurant in chinatown & this food here at noodle house 3 is just as great . get some !
asian	fresh , thick slices of fish with perfectly cooked rice and genuine japanese flavors . a true hidden gem
asian	my favourite near my home . on par with my other go-to : the fry . love those green onions on top of the chicken . the soy mustard sauce is very tasty . we also ordered a baked chicken and rice dish - very spicy - but really good flavour . i liked the option to get unbreaded chicken get as well . they have a 25c mini coffee machine - just like in korea ! i loved those machines everywhere . it really feels authentic . all korean clientele so you know it 's the taste of home . enjoy that baked corn as well !
asian	great prices . amazed on why people og to other places
asian	this is our second time ordering this week and that 's very rare because my wife isn 't a fan of chinese . it was her idea to go with chinese .
asian	i ordered chicken vegetable soup and loved it , vegetables were prepared just right lightly cooked fresh and crispy . we also ordered pad sew ew with chicken . dish was very tender , light and flavorful sauce , crisply vegetates . definitely a place to go back to !
asian	sharon is super nice and very attentive . we had a fabulous dining experience , even with 2 small children in tow ! highly reccomed the sun devil roll ! if you like spicy rolls , you will thouroughly enjoy ! price was extremely reasonable . they even have a food challenge ! the godzilla roll ( which is delicious ) challenge . if you can eat it in an hour it 's free and you get a t-shirt ! my dining partner has set this as his goal for his upcoming birthday ! we will be coming here for a long time ! !
asian	the good is very good and authentic . i tried the pho noodles and pork fresh rolls while my boyfriend tried the curry and tofu fresh rolls . we loved this place so much we went back twice in 2 days . it 's a gem in the middle of edinburgh and an easy walk from the west end . vegetarian and vegan friendly - just tell the staff and they 'll accommodate .
asian	amazing friendly staff and the best pho i have had on the west end , a definite must try .
asian	they always greet me with amazing energy , and they suggest and modify the bowls to fit my diet . fish is super fresh ! ! location is hidden off in the corner but , the restaurant is super clean ! love it .
asian	to start , the décor makes you feel like you 're truly in asia ! the service was impeccable . a lot of team work , very friendly and knowledgeable . i had the tao martini , delicious , the couple sitting next me saw mine and ordered one as well . i started out with the lobster wontons , oh so yummie ! in a nice hot pot , so they stay nice and hot , i 'd say its a good appetizer to share . then i had their vegetable fried rice , very good and the molten chocolate cake , awesome ! ! ! can 't wait to go back ! i def enjoy this one more than the one in nyc .
asian	from the kind service to the fresh eats you can 't beat it . bought a variety of food to try this place out - doubles , chicken roti , jerk chicken , sweet and sour chicken , chicken fried rice , spring rolls , enmore lo mein .. all of it was tasty and fresh . love the down to earth feel when you call in- just great service all around . hot sauce is also beautiful . check this place out ! got to love supporting local spots like this . enjoy !
asian	enjoyed the food and staff was excellent : ) would definitely go here again ..... and recommend it . even if you can 't cook , still a great experience .
asian	if you are looking for a twist on burgers and sushi ! our server kassy is amazing and friendly
asian	i have been here a handful of times , and always get the same thing ! also have had the spam masubi , which is also very good .
asian	the vietnamese pho is the best around . unbelievable broth .
asian	they accept credit ( square ! ) or cash only . no debit but that 's okay !
asian	the best in town ! ! ! noodles too ! ! ! great deals for lunch specials but the best for evening to go in groups cuz of the big round tables ! ! ! perfect for families : d definitely recommend it ! ! !
asian	general tso chicken was the best i 've had . server was efficient and friendly . not overly busy on a sunday with is nice to come in and relax .
asian	generous tuna portion and fresh . got huntington bowl with greens to avoid carbs . friendly staff . we have poke spots in ny but this will do . only $ 11.91 . not bad price to eat here compared to many other spots .
asian	david the chef was wonderful . homemade pasta at it 's best . we will be back for sure . the only reason i didn 't give it 5 stars was because of 2 things- they don 't have a set closing time and that made us feel bad because we were the last customers in the restaurant and i knew they were trying to get outta there . not having a closing time makes it hard for me because i don 't like being that customer that walks in 30 minutes before closing . the other reason was because it is a little pricy to make it a once a week or so place .
asian	found this place on yelp ( of course ) when in town visiting for work . in a week and a half i 've been here 3 times . i think i 've got a solid 3 more visits left before i head back to the south . the sushi is exquisite ! so delicious and i wouldn 't have that expectation being its location in the mid west . the staff is so friendly and incredibly attentive . the best sushi i 've had in a while and on wednesday 's and saturday 's they have half off rolls ! love , love , love ! highly recommend !
asian	i tried their japanese popcorn chicken and it was absolutely delicious ! from their hot crispy chicken to their drizzled teriyaki sauce and mayo to their slightly drifting bonito flakes and seaweed , they hit it right on the nail ! so on point ! ! i have not tried the other popcorn chicken versions but i heard they 're not as decked out . so give it a try ! ! : ) plus , their sago mango dessert does not disappoint ! ! ; )
asian	by far the best i 've ever had ! ! ! the fish was sooo fresh ad melted like butter in my mouth ! ! view was amazing and ambience was great ! suchhh a clean and tasteful place ! !
asian	my go to lunch spot ! i 've gotten sweet and sour chicken , pad thai , garlic chicken , won ton soup on all separate occasions and extremely satisfied ! always hot , quick , and friendly service ! i 'll have to check out their new tempe location ! signed an extremely picky eater lol
asian	gizzards , tongue , pork loin , octopus , kisu all tasted fresh and clean . a must go to for all
asian	husband loved the pork with mustard on top with regular ramen . the salads were delicious too very fresh . modern . had a kimchi plate which was awesome but you 'd have to love kimchi it 's 4 types with quick root veggie pickles that 's it . great sake ! topped it off with amazing service ! will be back for sure !
asian	go here . try everything ! incredible food . large portions . low prices . excellent thai iced coffee and iced tea !
asian	definitely coming back regularly . for around 13 bucks 6 rolls of sushi , a bento box , and free ice cream . place is clean and has a nice ambience to it . staff is friendly and service is quick .
asian	one of the best spicy tofu soup yet . very generous with the meat portion .
asian	good pricing . close to home . seating was comfortable . staff was very polite . many choice of deserts .
asian	good selection of nigiri , rolls , and appetizers . solid quality and fast service . it really is all you can eat - and it 's cheap ! i eat a lot of sushi and would put this up against most anything else . i wasn 't a fan of their tempura batter , but everything else waaay outweighed that . will definitely come back . ( frequent traveller from out of town )
asian	got there at 12pm on a thursday afternoon and there was already a line up ! i think it took us roughly 15-20 minutes to get a seat inside ( which isn 't too bad ) . the broth was amazing and rich ! i asked for less salt and it was perfection . and the meat just melted in your mouth ! santouka broth is better than sansotei , kinton and kenzo . this is probably the best ramen in downtown toronto !
asian	great ambiance. amazing food. servers are incredibly knowlegable of everything offerred and they are super sweet .
asian	great atmosphere and even better food . a friend recommended this place to us and we were so grateful that he did . the khao soi might easily be one of the yummiest things i have ever eaten . my boyfriend ordered the pad thai which was also delicious but almost boring in comparison . we will be back to try every single other item on the menu , as long as i can tear myself away from the khao soi ... i 'm getting hungry just thinking about it ! come eat here ! if i could give them 10 stars i would. bonus : affordable too and great service !
asian	love the byob . the food is well done . their staff could be a little nicer . sometimes when we call to ask about how long the wait is they aren 't always nice over the phone . happy with the food though .
asian	great atmosphere and unbelievable service ! ! bianca was out server and she rocked ! blue fin tuna , fluke sashimi were some of our favorites . what a great spot and amazing service . will be back ! !
asian	great experience , great food , great service . lots of fun to cook the food and the sides were delicious .
asian	great experience . the food was excellent as was the service . i definitely recommend the ultimate shrimp roll . soooooo good ! ! !
asian	great find . we got the spicey beef and it was delicious . will defiantly be back .
asian	great food , awesome staff , clean clean clean ! i have never had a bad experience here , the food is always fresh and so delicious whether i stick with my regular vermicelli pork dish or beef pho soup with extra chicken at no extra charge ! love the servers who are very welcoming . it is also very clean , especially for basement washrooms . this is our go to spot . cheap delicious eats and a great atmosphere !
asian	great food , great atmosphere . amazing pad thai and other dishes great too . a must in toronto .
asian	great food , great prices ( especially the happy hour menu ) , and great service.the food came out very quickly and i was visited on a friday night . the server was very attentive to refilling our drink orders and the chefs were all legit ! ! this was one of my best sushi experiences
asian	great food , service was great , deni was really friendly . byob . highly recommend ! ! ! ! !
asian	great food . the rolls are the freshest . it was like when you have that sip of coke after being nearly dehydrated for two days . life altering . the service is wonderful . very nice people . very accommodating for our cultural differences . the soup magnificent . i had a four star experience . if you pass by and you don 't stop you are denying yourself the finest things in life . service is faster than i formally knew that was humanly possible .
asian	great , fresh food , and the kindest owners . always clean and tidy , and affordable . i come from the other side of the city to eat here ! !
asian	great interior design , and even better food . the miso was a little on the salty side , but amazing . you can really never go wrong with vegetable tempura and the edemame dumplings were delicious ! by reading the previous reviews it seems that if you are a meet eater it 's not very good but for vegetarians it 's great .
asian	great little spot with a fun , casual atmosphere . also love that as long as you avoid the peak dinner hours there is very little wait for a table . delicious thai food . we love the pad thai bolen and the mi ga ti is also delicious . the portions are a big smaller than typical thai fare , so be prepared to order an extra main or a few app 's to share . family friendly : would be on okay spot for older kids but not toddlers as seating is stool seating . tight downtown spot and carriers would be preferred to strollers .
asian	great portions and tasty options ! delivery is quick and they are always consistent and delicious ! i love that everything tastes fresh and you can make your own bowl different every time ! i 've eaten here so many times , i 've lost count ! let 's hope they open one in maricopa !
asian	great price for how much you get . highly recommend everything on the menu . staff is super sweet and i definitely have no complaints . can 't wait to go back wonderful .
asian	great prompt service by handsome beefy guys , delicious meats and an amaaaazing doenjang jjigae soup . our grill built into the table seemed slower than the portable ones others had so next time we 'll opt for one of those .
asian	great quality ! ! ! the sushi and also the kitchen good are both wonderful . service is good they are short staffed it seems , but the servers work hard and do their best . although the service may be slow it 's totally worth it for the food ! ! !
asian	great ramen ! great prices ! great service ! a little on the small side but very comfortable . worth leaving the strip !
asian	great selection , fantastic service ! went with a large group but they were very accommodating and had everything out relatively quickly !
asian	great service and food . you do have to bring your own wine . but there is a store across the street !
asian	great service , and selection of food ! the quality and taste of the meat was insanely delish ! the hot food and salad bar has everything u would want ! loved the fresh fruit and dessert ! grabbed some fresh garlic , onion , and jalapeños to add the the grill ! the smells and flavors were to perfection , my bf is a great cook and enjoyed the experience ! it is great for groups fun for a date night ! will def be coming back next time we visit vegas
asian	great service , beautiful presentations , high quality rare fish . hidden gem in summerlin tucked in a non discrete shopping mall next to yummy sushi . it does not have a sign so just walk into the door on the left of yummy . typically need to make a reservation days in advance , they only have 6pm and 8 : 30pm seating . once you sit down you will embark on 20 + course sushi journey , trying high quality fish from around the world . it is a fixed menu at $ 165 per person and well worth it . not for the faint of heart if you 're not willing to try new things .
asian	great service great chefs awesome food .. blown away ! warning ! ! ! warning ! ! ! once you eat here regular food will not taste the same .. eat at roka if you want to eat like a king !
asian	great staff , adorable chefs , great food ! staff was constantly moving around and taking care of the entire restaurant .
asian	great staff and tasty food ! buy a shirt and receive 10 % off for life . speedy service and excellent pho . spring rolls and egg rolls also very tasty !
asian	awesome happy hour . lots of complimentary items . great service . when servers are weeded the management seems to be there pulling up the slack . just a wonderful experience . thank you kabuki
asian	great sushi , great service , nice but not intrusive . small place because it is a family owned business but definitely not a problem . the atmosphere is relaxed and authentic . i 've always had a hard time with trying new sushi places but i 'm definitely impressed and love the fact that spending money here goes to a family run , local business . if you love sushi and supporting your community , this is the place to be . owner use to manage sushi restaurant on the east coast and in phoenix until opening up his own place ! we will definitely be returning to this friendly establishment ( :
asian	first time i cannot finish whole meal ( ° ° ) and only cost around 7 dollars with salad , soup , and drink . i had garlic pork chop w / honey garlic fish , it 's delicious ! i like the tender and juicy pork chop , fish is great too . especially , the fried rice is surprisingly tasty , its golden color egg fried rice , its not too dry or oil , i love it ! moreover , the drink is the best ! i think it 's hong kong style homemade ice lemon tea , it 's real lemon add in . really really recommend this place !
asian	we would have easily driven by this place if not for the great yelp reviews . this is " off the beaten track " and located in a desolate shopping center near chinatown . although service is slow ( we were told by the owner 's brother that the location previously was home to a small sandwich shop so the kitchen grill is very small ) , the vermicelli noodle bowl with grilled pork and pork egg roll was worth the wait .
asian	come try it out . not to mention- they have a korean beef bbq dish !
asian	had a sushi burrito craving and rolltation did not disappoint ! they have a great selection of signature rolls as well as an option to build you own ! the rice to stuffing proportion was perfect ! the salmon was super fresh as well as all the ingredients i side topped with a great sauce ! ! the staff is super friendly and quick with service ! ! already telling all my friends to come here ! will be back again soon ! !
asian	had some recommended warm saki coupled with a chefs special double salmon roll and a ginger roll . wow this place is amazing
asian	had the coconut soup , and the green curry ! also thai tea ! it was all so delicious , and i couldn 't finish it !
asian	amazing had the fresh shrimp spring rolls , red curry chicken , chicken pad thai , and mango sticky rice this place is one of the best thai places i 've ever been to , if not the best .
asian	had the pad gra pow at a level 3 spice which was very flavorful .. spicy yet i was still able to taste my food .. sticky rice plus peanut sauce was an awesome add .. we also received complimentary gyoza .. might of been completely empty inside but soo worth it .. also the price was very cheap considering how big the portions were .. love it ! ! go show some love ! !
asian	had the pad puck with shrimp and will definitely keep going back ! my bf also had the sweet and sour chicken & shrimp . again very good . spring rolls as an appetizer and we were all set . i hope they do carry out because i 'd love to have them even when i don 't feel like sitting in .
asian	had the pork banh mi , rare steak pho and the bbq pork vermicelli . wow ! best vietnamese food i 've had in vegas hands down ! ! ! even received an order of free springs rolls . delish ! we will definitely be going back again and again .
asian	had the surf and turf ( beef inside the roll with seafood on top ) and ahi burger . the beef / sushi fusion is so tasty and a cool concept . great sauces and good service !
asian	had the veggie stir fry with chicken for lunch and it was the perfect portion for $ 9 and it came with a drink . the levels of spicy are 0 - 5 . i can 't really do spicy so i got a 0 but my husband got a 3 and it made his nose runny . so watch out ! they have heaters in the outside seating area and the service was super friendly and attentive .
asian	we usually dine in here and never taken out . food quality and taste is mostly consistent during each visit . they have a huge a la carte menu . we usually order sweet corn chicken soup , spicy cauliflower , chicken pakoros or lollypop , egg fried rice and cashew chicken ( chicken with lots of diced veggies ) and its all amazing . the meat and veggies are fresh . they do have some good sodas for summer months - fresh lime , blueberry etc .
asian	i 've had the bombay chicken , house special hakka noodle , all simply amazing . flavourful , fresh , generous portions . some leftovers for lunch the next day . very friendly and courteous staff , large dining room . place is always busy with diners .
asian	everything made in house and full of great flavours . the rice or noodles option is a nice twist on a classic . great price and well worth it .
asian	we came and there was a bit of a wait . definitely worth it . i ordered the beef noodle soup and my boyfriend had the dan dan noodle . we also had the beef pancake which was almost more like a pan fried dumpling . it was fun watching them make the noodles in front of you .
asian	noodles are made right in front of you . soup dumplings are special . a must for those visiting sq . hill .
asian	this place is nicely tucked in the china town area but it 's definitely worth the visit .
asian	got braised beef with flat thin noodles and the small size was enough to satisfy ! good portions and good amount of meat for the price point of $ 7.99 . i only wished the soup base was more spicy , but they give a bottle of hot chilli oil on each table . next time i would get flat regular noodles because the thin ones got soft sitting in the soup . service was good , place seemed clean . highly recommend this noodle joint and will definitely be back ! !
asian	the menu is small , only offering two types of noodles , but they do it very well . soup was fresh and light , not too salty . the beef appetizer was soooooo good . jelly fish was quite enjoyable too but it was light on the sesame oil . maybe it was just our dish . cucumbers weren 't memorable . will definitely be back again ! !
asian	hands down , favorite place to go all the time forever . amazing food ! authentic and the service is wonderful . this is me and my girlfriends favorite , go-to place for dinner . our date place . she loves the udon suki and the sushi . we 've been here so many times in the past two years and the staff knows us by name . it looks creepy from the outside plaza but you walk in and it 's like you 're in a completely different place . words can 't describe how much we love this place , if i had a last meal before i died , it would be here . 100 %
asian	hands down my favorite restaurant in the phoenix / scottsdale area . consistently delicious ! everything on the menu is great , but i usually get the # 12 large - five spice noodle soup ( pho ) . while the food is incredible , the owners are the main reason that i continue going back for more ! i love this place ! i get so excited talking about it ... i can 't wait until my next visit ! thank you ! ! !
asian	hands down the best poke i 've ever had ! ! we recently moved to henderson from southern california where fresh fish is readily available so i was worried i wouldn 't be able to find something out here i liked and wow was i pleasantly surprised ! poke express is the best i 've ever had ! ! ! ! i ordered 4 different varieties and can 't wait to go back and try even more ! !
asian	hands down wonderful sushi ! ! ! first time here and we will definitely be back ! ! service was awesome as well ; super friendly and fast !
asian	$ 2 california rolls and $ 6 rainbow roll . love the meat to rice ratio in the rolls ( loads of meat and very little rice ) . sundays from open till 5pm will definitely be doing sunday sushi from now on ! ! for 4 rolls , a green tea and a beer ( $ 2 ) $ 20 ! and delicious ! ! !
asian	good for date nights , groups , or families . sushi is always fresh and tastes great ! drink deals are a plus with delicious green tea ice cream to end the visit . i highly recommend yen sushi !
asian	best selection and totally affordable . their blue flame and las vegas roll are delicious ! ! ! !
asian	half off wines drafts and appetizers and 2 $ off specialty drinks making the margarita only 3 $ ! ! ! ! there 's so many flavors to choose from too ! blood orange , prickly pear , mai tai .. too many to name ! great place to start to explore south side !
asian	prices are fantastic . quick orders . fresh roles and always quick refill on my drink . thank u
asian	we had the pleasure of having another cool islander from hawaii serve us . will definitely be back when i return to vegas .
asian	$ 5 for a sake bomber , what that is nuts , getting tipsy thinking about it . their sushi is better than most in the valley . if you can sit outside as it gets a little cramped inside . the chinese is good as well , i usually get the mongolian beef . if we lived closer we would go here over kona .
asian	i come here often and the service is always really great . the managers are also very friendly . the only reason i give it 4 out of five because nothing beats fresh sushi that is close to the ocean ; )
asian	the miso eggplant forever changed me ! it was delicious ! ! the beef rolls were also great ! ! i didn 't like the tomato roll , but surprisingly the hubby really did , so it must be a matter of taste : ) we got stuffed for under $ 40 on the strip for dinner , and thoroughly enjoyed our meal ! ! big time score ! !
asian	love the miso and the edamae . kid friendly for sure too . i enjoyed their rolls and my daughter had lots of fun with their bowl .
asian	try the samurai roll , angry tuna roll and pork belly ramen . don 't miss the siphon coffee after dinner . best coffee ever ! joe the bartender is fantastic , so sit in the lounge to enjoy the happy hour specials . highly , highly recommend ! !
asian	we stopped here on vacation on advice from someone we met at a ballgame . very glad we went . the hh deals they have are pretty awesome . our total bill was $ 30 and we had 3 sushi rolls , cucumber salad and 2 beers . not bad at all . the sushi was pretty yummy .
asian	sushi is very good , one of my favorites .
asian	having seen all my sf / bay area friends post all these new poke bowl places up there , i was so excited to learn of this place in vegas so i can enjoy some ! however haven 't ordered a bowl yet cause i 'm still getting through all the sushi burritos . even better they said they may be opening one near me in the southwest area ! seriously will be there weekly , so good ! ! fast , friendly and super delicious . it gets pretty crowded so go early . last time we went and got it to go and i pretty much inhaled it !
asian	the best hawaiian food outside of hawaii hands down . i visited las vegas from los angels and after experiencing most of the restaurants in the hotels and the strip ... this one was the highlight of the trip and def worth the drive . the portions are huge and the prices are great ! i had the poke which was unbelievable . the hawaiian fish was incredible with a side of the sweet purple potatoes . we tried their chicken and the tried rice which was great . and for desert - guava cake - yum ! ! put it on your must try list when you are in vegas next time and you would not regret it ! : )
asian	heaven in your mouth ? yes ... yes it is .... i 've watched it grow in popularity over the past few years , and with that , the prices have really increased . while it 's still amazing to eat , it 's freakin ' expensive now . seating is very limited , and it 's always crammed packed , so call ahead & order to save yourself 30 minutes of waiting . oh , and it 's not open on the weekend , which sucks . my fav : saag paneer .
asian	always large portion sizes and they 're very generous with the amount of yum yum sauce they give . prices are reasonable . ( $ 7 per entree ) it almost never takes long to get the food - i feel like average is about 10 minutes . wish they had more seating space !
asian	my husband and i come here sometimes for lunch . their prices are reasonable and you get a lot of food ! i always order vegetable hibachi with teriyaki sauce and it is by far the best teriyaki sauce i have had anywhere in charlotte . also , their sweet carrots come with your meal and are delicious ! my husband orders steak hibachi and he loves it too ! definitely a favorite lunch place in uptown !
asian	food is amazing ! sushi is all half off all the time ! two people- soup , salad , sushi , hibachi steak and chicken dinner , noodles , rice , veggies , shrimp , and sake $ 60 easily ! service is hit and miss ! make a reservation but still expect a wait .
asian	great menu and a frequent delivery go-to spot . friendly staff and quick service .
asian	definitely one of the best sushi places in town . humble , quaint , family run , authentic japanese food . large portions and numerous appetizers included . will definitely be coming back .
asian	ready to get off the strip today and chinese sounded good . we 've been to some of the finest chinese restaurants on the strip including pearl and while that was good this was amazing . no frills . just super good food . order taken and written in chinese . that 's how authentic . highly recommend
asian	i recommend the corn butter ramen , with shoyu based & no bamboo . the fried rice is extremely good & service is always quick & good .
asian	we took the chef selection for 65 $ each person and it was amazing ! the chef is actually japanese born and raised and it shows a place for sure that we will go back for couple or a group of friends
asian	my go-tos are lobster miso soup , salmon roll , and aburicious roll . lucky to have this high end japanese restaurant as my neighborhood sushi spot !
asian	highly recommend i usually don 't eat fish but the waiter recommended i try the cod , i did not regret it . i had forgotten fish could taste this good , worth the price . they also have a good wine selection . the ambiance is very nice , it 's calm , you can enjoy your meal peacefully . ( i want on a weekday , it might be different on the weekend )
asian	dinner portion was so large i couldn 't finish the whole thing . i got the spicy eggplant dinner dish with rice & tofu . i told them i didn 't want the tofu fried and they were able to accommodate me . i asked for level 5 in the spiciness which is the spiciest you can get but when i was coughing from the spice they came right away with the water and gave me more rice . at first i thought the price was a bit high but the dish was so large it can serve 2 ! ! took lots of leftovers home . service was great . great qualify food and nice atmosphere ! !
asian	amazing high quality food , great costumer service all the staff are so welcoming this is the place we feel like hanging out on weekends it 's perfect for birthday party or any kind of party
asian	the menu is deep and slowly changing as he tries new things . i am excited to see what he has in store for us in the future . awesome value and neat touches to his food like blowtorch sushi .
asian	hole in a wall but delicious food . won 't go wrong . the pad thai was fantastic and the eggplant dish was awesome ! price was good . was a take out so not sure on the service . spice level right on ! ! ! i eat very hot food and 4 was a little too much for me ! i will try level 3 next time .
asian	cheap , fast , and delicious ! tangerine chicken is the most tender i 've ever had from a take out . you 'd be silly to not eat here if you 're craving take out .
asian	i passed this little food place after shopping on kensington ave . a small jerk chicken dish was 5 canadian dollars and it was a steal ! generous amount of food ! the jerk chicken dish came with rice and steamed vegetables . you can opt into cole slaw instead of steam vegetables . there was also many difference sauces to choose from . i chose grace 's hot and spicy sauce and it was so good . i would come back in a heartbeat ! best jerk chicken i 've ever had .
asian	incredibly kind staff , amazing food , great prices , and the best chinese food in the valley . my personal favorite dishes are the lemon chicken , mongolian beef , and hot and sour soup . when you go for dinner , they give you a plate of appetizers with a flame at the top so you can cook your own food , and there is a teapot with teacups on the table for lunch and dinner . after dinner , the staff brings out fried bananas with powdered sugar to your table . all of this is free ! make sure to come here , it is an unappreciated but incredible restaurant !
asian	love the ambiance . owner sat us down and talked to us for a bit . food took a while but it didn 't bother me when i tasted it . worth the wait . small staff that cares . refreshing to receive personal attention at a restaurant . will surely return and let my friends know about this gem .
asian	the bibimbap is as good as it gets and i love the small family-run kitchen , the focused menu options as well as the interesting k-pop music videos .
asian	the servers make their own food recommendations so don 't bother thinking too much about what to order . the food is succulent and very flavorful . it 's an evolving menu and there is plenty of room in the restaurant now ( these guys used to be much smaller ) .
asian	this was my first time experiencing korean food and i went with a classic. kimchi jjigae ! sour spicy goodness .
asian	hole in the wall . tons of awards and recognition . worth the wait .
asian	5 stars for sure ! we absolutely love chou 's kitchen !
asian	i had the boiled noodles with tomato and beef . it was tasty and not greasy . i sampled the stir fried noodles and they were good as well .
asian	amazing customer service . the epitome of hole-in-the-wall vietnamese cuisine .
asian	the crispy chicken is so juicy yet crispy . i honestly dream about this chicken . the food comes out super fast and is very well priced . i 'm still thinking about how delicious that chicken was .
asian	honestly , i can say this place has the best pad thai i have ever had . my husband and i wanted to try something new around surprise , which can be difficult for us since we usually always settle for wings . we are very happy to add another option to dinner list .
asian	ps . the tempura vegetables are to die for ! !
asian	i 've searched high and low in the city for good soup and this is bomb !
asian	hot basil chicken , ground to perfection ! hot basil noodles , tom yum kai , an appetizer sampler . friendliest staff . hidden away , but just off the strip and worth the short drive ! unless you can handle really spicy food , order a 3 or less ! !
asian	best i 've had in las vegas so far . delicious fries too ! i couldn 't stop eating them . got the bulgogi dog , smoked dog , and euro fries . can 't wait to go back and try more .
asian	also , don 't forget to try their euro fries . it 's just delicious , period .
asian	they 're still pretty new ( only been open a few months i think ? ) so they 're still getting their alcohol permit , but since it 's so new there 's no problem getting in and out with really fast service ! there 's a handful of other sushi places in the area i can 't say that for , as i can think of at least 2 other 's within a few miles that have practically forgotten my wife and i were sitting there . definitely worth checking out , they 've got all the rolls you 'd want , but what i thought separates them is some of the really creative appetizers !
asian	good for dim sum , and always packed on weekends . we come early to avoid that . also good for peking duck . although they skimp on the lettuce wraps , big-time !
asian	bottom line : if you 're looking for an amazing omokase experience , and are willing to spend for it , this is the place in toronto . my parents have toured japan 's finest places , and consider this an amazing place to dine in . i 'd still go back with the price tags they have . sit at the bar if you get a chance . better view and entertainment from there .
asian	huge fish selection all fresh . sauted and put on a delicious bun . and a great price .
asian	i am definitely a thai food enthusiast and have eaten at too many restaurants to name . but this thai restaurant is outstanding . we had the tom kah soup , and the green curry . omgsh , the curry is absolutely the best i have ever had . we drive from the west valley to eat here and it 's totally worth it . everything is fresh and delicious . this is the best thai restaurant i have been to . tenny is fantastic and so knowledgeable about the menu and the food . amazing experience . the portions were really big and the thai iced tea is twice the amount i usually get at other restaurants .
asian	i am so happy i found a hungarian place that serves amazing food. the owner is so so nice , and the food was fantastic. these people deserve your money !
asian	i am very impressed by their expeditious delivery , the quality and deliciousness of their food ! ! i ordered delivery via grubhub - the food was delivered within 40mins and was even greeted by my first name at the door . this place has beyond exceeded my expectations ! ! i will definitely be a regular here ! ! : - )
asian	i called in a to go order only 25 minutes before closing , but they were amazingly nice and helpful . the service was superb . i ordered the panang curry with tofu , and the portion was generous . i love super spicy thai food , and every restaurant generally disappoints in that regard ... but this place didn 't ! the veggies were crisp and fresh , and the tofu pieces were large and a great consistency . the price was also quite reasonable ( $ 9 ) . can 't wait to go back . this will definitely be my go to thai place going forward ! ! ! !
asian	i came here for lunch yesterday and returned today ( next day ) for dinner . it 's not a fancy place but is very clean , linen covered tables and warm customer service . my first experience was the green mango salad . simply one of the best things i have ever eaten . and the portion was huge ! for dinner , i ordered kung pao as my entree and cucumber rolls for an appetizer . first , the cucumber rolls were insane ! i could have eaten another order or two ! kung pao is their most popular dish and i can see why . loved all the super fresh vegetables . i love this place !
asian	i came in for my birthday and was a bit reluctant at first but wow i am so glad we came in . food was great , customer service was excellent . our server , dexter , was very attentive and knew the menu and had great suggestions . will definitely come again and refer to friends and family .
asian	i can honestly say that this place had the best fried rice i 've ever had ! the pho is amazing ! even my picky son enjoyed the soup . a must try .
asian	i can 't reiterate this enough ... it is amazing ! serving size and quality are exceptional . if you are a fan of japanese food ( authentic or otherwise ) you have to try this place . if you 're not , you still need to try this place , because it will make you a fan . last but not least , the service is great .
asian	i come here at least once a month and its always consistently great . i spent a year in korea and the bugolgi here is just as great !
asian	pick your pasta , then pick your sauce of which there are so.many it 's hard to choose . all freshly.made from the frying pan to your table . very small place so if 4 or more call for reservation . portions are large .
asian	i got the small with a kale base and topped it with crunchy garlic and ponzu sauce , super delicious and fresh ! don 't forget to have one of their macaron ice cream sandwiches , amazing !
asian	i decided to come back here after seeing that they were under new management and the restaurant looks so clean ! the service was really good ; although i did feel like they needed to learn a bit more english to make ordering more smooth . however , there was a lot of waiters so you never have to get their attention for more than 5 seconds before they come over the food was really good and you can taste the freshness . the lunch specials are so worth it too . i will come back again whenever i come back to vegas !
asian	i don 't even have words it 's so good . and the service is amazing . they are quick and friendly ! basically everything on the menu is delicious . if you want ramen this is where you have to go .
asian	i don 't even like thai food but my brother convinced me to go , and i am definitely coming back .
asian	i don 't know how else to describe it . food was awesome , service was quick , rick took care of us the whole time and he was second to none . my mom took me for my 19th birthday a week ago and they went above and beyond to make me special for me , they even had a happy birthday card on the table . i recommend it , food is incredible , service is amazing , and the place is super nice ! thank you so much rick !
asian	if i could give this place 100 stars i would ! the food is incredible , we literally just walked out of the restaurant and i can 't wait to go back ! ! amazing food , wonderful service , delicious twists on classic favorites ... such a hidden gem ! prices are beyond reasonable for the quantity and quality of food you 'll be eating . so thankful we found this place ! run , don 't walk towards this place and make your belly smile ! : )
asian	if you wait , when you finally come here you will kick yourself for having waited . don 't be a fool . a m a z i n g .
asian	i first discovered tokyo boys when i was out staying at westin lake las vegas for a conference . i was so blown away by it that 2 nights later i entertained some clients and colleagues and we had a nice " party " - - a fun night with awesome food . i cannot wait to return - and will definitely add pictures ! !
asian	the curry 's here are out of this world , with spice levels for all tolerance levels . very personable , friendly service , easy to grab a lunch on a 1 / 2 hour lunch break . highly recommend .. yellow curry is my personal favorite !
asian	if you like to eat a lot of sushi , this is the best place in town ! between the all-you-can-eat price , the abundance of nigiri / roll options , and the quality of food , sushi mon is the place to eat in las vegas ! it is a little bit of a drive from the strip , but it is completely worth the drive !
asian	if you need your roasted duck and bbq pork fix while in vegas this is the place to be . good , cheap and tons of other options . place isn 't " pretty " like most restaurants on the strip but the food is amazing .
asian	i go here all the time . the servers are great . the decor isn 't the best , but who cares because the sushi is amazing . the workers are awesome . they are very accommodating to my meal modifications since i eat a little on the healthy side . the sushi is also so so inexpensive . my friends flew in from michigan to visit me . instead of taking them anywhere on the strip i took them here ! its honestly such a great place .
asian	i got take out here one night and will definitely be back . pho was soo flavorful and delicious !
asian	i got the bento box , which comes with a mini burger and a sushi roll as well as 3 sides , for $ 16 . while expensive , it was totally worth it- the food was delicious and we have leftovers , which is always a plus . would highly recommend if in the charlotte area .
asian	i got the sashimi salad , it did not disappoint . the fish was fresh and nice thick pieces . i also got the tuna roll and it had a great flavor . i will have to come back because they have a huge menu ... i need to try more !
asian	i had a veggie and caalmari dish and my dining partner had a hot stone bowl filled with rice , veggies and meat . so delicious and very budget friendly .
asian	i had one of the best dining experiences with my family . the service was quick and on point . all the food from chicken to filet mignon to scallops to shrimp was fantastic . our chef was very funny and made it fun for everyone around the grill . i would recommend this restaurant to anyone , and once again you can always rely on yelp to find amazing places like this one .
asian	i had the # 18 , my friend had the pho both were extremely flavorful ! the staff is very friendly and the place is very clean . i recommend this place to anyone and i will be back !
asian	i had the bulgogi fries and another dish i was so full but couldnt stop eating .. will be going back for sure ! !
asian	i had the garlic salmon . it was amazing ! ! service was very friendly and price was pretty reasonable . will definitely be back !
asian	i had the pineapple curry with shrimp . so so good . can 't wait to go back . the atmosphere is lovely and the ginger tea also good .
asian	i had the pork , shrimp , and coriander dumplings fried . such a great combination of flavors . you can watch the dumplings being hand made . i definitely recommend .
asian	i had the purple fusion and it was heaven and the brick toast was better than you know what . ; - ) . i am totally coming back here .
asian	i had the veggie pho ( for dieting reasons ) . this was amazing . i recommend this place completely .
asian	i have been a long time " monta " patron and i think i have found a formidable contender . the soup was sooooooo good the miso is bomb ! more choices for toppings , inexpensive for the quality and the broth was cleaner and leaner . not so fatty ... plus the service was outstanding ! the darling server brought out my little baby of 20 months his own bowl and baby utensils .. so good , i 'll be back very very soon .
asian	i have been going here for years . the best thai food in the valley . amazingly friendly service and they always get it right . if you 're looking for fresh thai food you 've found the right spot .
asian	i have been here now 4 times and have never been let down . the staff are extreamly friendly , and get the orders out pretty quick ! i usually get their pho , but i recently tried their vermicelli and was not disapointed . i will continue to come back here !
asian	i have been here twice already . and for a good reason . try the shabu-shabu . this is the only restaurant in town that has it . ( if you saw " lost in translation " you know what i am talking about ) . their tempura and sushi is also great . a very special place with an amazing service . i even had a free sake tasting !
asian	the service is great , and there is one specific waitress that makes great suggestions . however , there is one waitress that has told me to quickly eat the sushi- because the seaweed will become soggy . the way she had phrased it made it seem like she wanted me to hurry up and finish ! the chicken dumplings are so tasty ! the chicken wing is stuffed with vegetables and chicken , instead of rice like at other restaurants . their tofu cheesecake is light and not too sweet . i have never eaten anything at inatei i have not enjoyed . i highly recommend this restaurant to seafood and sushi lovers .
asian	i have eaten here several times and have tried much of the menu . i haven 't had a bad dish yet . everything from the panang curry , tom yum soup , beef salad , bbq pork , and of course the pad thai . i highly recommend this place .
asian	i have tried the shrimp lover and the dragon roll burrito . the food is amazing and great quality . the staff is so friendly and helpful and offer their advice on what to get in your burrito or bowl .
asian	i love this place . i can 't believe it took me this long to stop in ! i had the pad thai and eggroll . this food is fresh tasting , fulfilling , and pretty inexpensive . i would recommend this place to anyone .
asian	i keep going back for more . i 'm in love ! it is soooo delicious . that in itself is an understatement . the servers are so sweet and always give us a new dessert same to try after our meal ! one of my favorite restaurants ever !
asian	i live 10 miles away and order take out whenever possible . hands down best chinese i 've had in town yet !
asian	i live downtown and this sushi place is close n convient ! the food was great and the staff super friendly ! i find the pricing is not too bad , and the food is awesome ! i tried some things that were recommended and i was not disappointed , i have only been once but guarantee i will be back !
asian	i live in the neighborhood . i am in village square all the time . i have passed this place many times but my introduction was at the vegas yelpers party a few weeks ago . they were one of the sampling restaurants at the party . they had me at hawaiian dog . in the days of mystery meat , they explained how they make their sausages which are top quality . now i have been at their location a few times . the bahn mi is becoming my new favorite .
asian	i love sue and charlie ! sweet family owned place ! ! great talent behind the scenes ! ! ! fresh noodles daily ! we go here twice a week ! !
asian	i love the food . i 've tried a lot of pho places and their pho is by far the best i 've tried in vegas . me and friends come here very often and the service is very good ! ! i only wish the thai tea and sodas were free refills : ( but that won 't make me stop coming here ! !
asian	i love the pork buns and pretty much all of the appetizers . highly recommended .
asian	i love there food ! ! ! ! ! they have the best chow mein try it !
asian	i love unagi , it 's the ugliest of the sushis but the yummiest . i tried the unagi banana sushi bc a bartender at melt recommended it once . sooo glad i tried it . their sushi is fresh and the perfect size . the owner was going around and talking to all the guests , very pleasant man . i will definitely be returning !
asian	i 'm a bonafide sushi lover now although i haven 't mastered the chopsticks and i played it safe with california rolls .
asian	i 'm a sushi fanatic and love this place . everything is so flavourful and the portions are just right ! i know that for sure , i 'll become a regular here ! !
asian	i 'm a sushi snob from new york and this place is great . get the cherry blossom roll and the pink floyd . everything was fresh and delicious ! ! thanks pete for introducing us to koishi !
asian	i 'm from bc and i know it 's very rare finding a good fresh sushi out here in to . but this place reminded me of vancouver and it was just perfect . i gotta be honest the service was terrible however the sushi was very fresh and delicious which is why i will rate it 5 star . pricing was very reasonable .
asian	i 'm from hawaii and they have the best kalbi here ! ! ! even the meatjun is great ! ! ! i 've been coming here for years and have not been disappointed once .
asian	i 'm from kaua 'i , born and raised . have lived on the mainland for 15 years now and have never found such an authentic hawaiian eatery . everything from the simple atmosphere , to the owners and staff . and the food . my god the food . the laulau is as good as any i 've had back home . lomilomi salmon , amazing . kalua pork , katsu . saimin . and the freaking manapua . this is the only place in az to get the real deal hawaiian food . can 't believe it 's taken me so long to find it .
asian	i 'm from the bay area and i was skeptical at first , but all doubts wen away . this place is phenomenal . the food is amazing , the staff is kind and patient , and overall the experience was some of the best chinese food i 've had in the united states . wish i had more starts to give !
asian	i 'm not sure i know the right words to describe the food here. i got the pad thai burger and the wife got the teriaki burger . they were both unlike anything we 've had in the past . i went a step too far in ordering fries that featured wasabi ( in decent volumes ) which i cannot handle . the guys there were super friendly and we chatted with them for a bit . really rooting for them to be successful - the concept is too delicious to not be shared with the world .
asian	amazing in all aspects , food decor service .... fruits infused with wasabi were awesome
asian	i always order for pick up and it 's never taken more then 20 mins for them to finish the order . highly recommended .
asian	super cheap . must try everything ! i don 't know why people don 't come here . we had a large group and just got our grub on ! overall , still licking the sauce from both thumbs !
asian	i have tried a variety of their dishes and my favorite is the vindaloo ... service is always exceptional as is the food ! !
asian	i just finished a meeting and was starving and was looking for some restaurants on this street . i decided to venture into this small restaurant and oh my lord is it ever tasty . very delicious and gd pricing
asian	wonderful service i 'm definitely coming back . two thumbs up
asian	i never liked thai food until a friend brought me here . it 's kind of a hole in the wall and a bit difficult to find if you 're not familiar with the area , but it 's so worth the effort to find ! ! great lunch specials and great service ! the food is definitely a 5 star in my opinion , but there is often a sulfur like smell emanating from the restroom area ...
asian	sam the owner is the sushi master . highly recommend the spider roll , red dragon and cherry blossom roll . everything is delicious and fresh .
asian	inexpensive and they were very honest about the spicing . paneer chili was to die for . i feel like i shouldn 't be writing this because i don 't want them to be too busy for us . lassi a little thin . service was very nice too .
asian	i ordered the # 7 shaken beef and i highly recommend it ! ! ! you must order it with the fried egg . actually everything on this menu should have a fried egg on it ! we also ordered crab puffs , egg rolls and the vegetable platter ... all amazing .
asian	i ordered the butterscotch braised pork belly , and my boyfriend had the wild ginger chicken . best chinese we 've had , hands down . we liked the ambience too . we will be back .
asian	i ordered the sesame chicken and then pork fried rice . the pork wasn 't very good but i picked it out , bc the rice was awesome . the sesame chicken was crunchy and full of delicious flavor . love this place ! ! !
asian	i ordered the spicy orange beef and i 'm still in shock that what i was eating was completely vegan ! i definitely recommend this restaurant ! they offer a variety of plates and also have a separate menu for deserts ! i will be back !
asian	i prefer to dine in rather than take out just because of the way the soup works with adding all of the ingredients . defiantly try this place !
asian	i returned in march to dtf and loved practically everything that my friend and i had ordered . the xlb 's were the star of the show , and the shenzehnbaos were excellent , as well . i heard that this dtf is not officially connected to the real chain in taiwan ? i 'm not sure if that 's true or not , but it tastes good enough to be real .
asian	we started with happy hour . 5 $ saki bombs and 5 $ sushi rolls . we tried the tempura salmon roll and the philadelphia . both were spectacular . my entrée was the salmon plate . at 14 $ it was worth every penny . i was given two huge pieces of salmon that was seared in teriyaki . this is by far the best sushi place i have ever been to . and could u imagine it 's in the middle of the desert ? ? just amazing . i can 't wait to come back and stuff my face again at this place . make sure you come during happy hour to get the great deals on the best sushi and drinks .
asian	food was outstanding , service was perfect and prices were unbeatable . i can safely say it is the best sushi restaurant in town .
asian	i sat at the bar , so i ended up leaving the place smelling of food , but i didn 't even care . everything was well made and prepared right in front of us . the staff is also very friendly , and it is clear that this restaurant has been an important part of the community for a long time . it 's cash only so be prepared for that . i would recommend 100 %
asian	island style is a gem . not only is the food always delicious ... but the customer service is soooo fabulous . russell , his wife , younghee ... they are sooo personable and really make you feel at home . we would go at least three times a week if we lived closer . if i 'm anywhere near , i will call ahead and order takeout for my family . dolsat bibimbap is our all-time favorite , meat jun , fish jun , jajangmyun , naengmyun ( in the summer ) , the boiled peanut appetizers , steamed mandu ... yummmmm !
asian	amazing customer service and amazing food. the best is the amazing chicken . splurge and add the lo mein for a small fee , so worth it !
asian	restaurant is small and seating is cramped and the service can be a little slow ( in true italian style ) . they also do not have a liquor license so it is byob . with all that said have eaten their food 3 times in the last month .
asian	it doesn 't get fresher than this . i give the mandu two thumbs up . this restaurant only seats 10 -12 people . one lovely lady waits on you , cooks your food and delivers it . it is a true dining experience . she brought us out some fresh cooked korean vegetables . i love to try new foods . very small , but it is so quaint and warm inside . you feel comfortable immediately . take a chance and try this place .... you won 't be disappointed .
asian	it has only been 8 days since they opened , and it is running smooth , friendly and delicious . bibimbap bowl is so tasty and off the beaten path . we also had the sando and it is tooooo good . yum . can 't wait to come back .
asian	i think the soup cured my horrifying hangover ... seriously it was so yummy that i wanted to barf repeatedly just to eat more . also , the delivery guy knew english !
asian	i think they should add a dance floor too ! the food is so good the pepper sauce is amazing people are friendly service is a bit slow but worth it ! ! i haven 't been there for a while but would love to go again !
asian	it is so hard to find a good chinese restaurant . we have been here / ordered from hot wok 3 times in the past 6 months and it has always been on point , even when i have special requests . hot , fresh and always tastes wonderful : ) from their pad thai , to spring rolls , kung pao , orange chicken , walnut shrimp and beyond ! fast service dine in and delivery ... amazing !
asian	i travel to las vegas often for business and i make sure that i stop in and get me a " spicy chicken bowl " before i head back home . the staff is usually friendly and the place is moderately busy . i wish there was a teriyaki madness in san diego , i would be their best fan . ; )
asian	i tried this place for the first time about a month ago and i 've been back every week since . it has replaced ' i love sushi ' as my favorite sushi spot . jesse is one of the sushi chefs and he makes the best i 've ever had . my personal favorite is the vampire roll . definitely make the trip to this one .
asian	i trusted the yelp reviews and glad i did . so good . upgrade the meat and get the angus beef and the spicy garlic chicken . both so tender .
asian	we ordered the fiesta plate . it did not disappoint ! the lumpia was very good , too . the wait was a bit longer than i anticipated ( 25 mins ) . we 'll order ahead of time . the staff were extremely friendly and helpful . thank you for bringing chamorro food to henderson !
asian	it 's one of those dime a dozen sushi spots but once you sit down and eat the food it becomes top notch . this place is a hidden gem . amazing food and service .
asian	it was our first visit , so we chose the tasting menu , in order to get a general idea of the restaurant . every dish was amazing ! the eel bibimbap was probably the best bibimbap i 've ever had . i also loved the ambiance and thought that the staff makes you feel super welcome . will definitely come back !
asian	i 've been here many times with my friends . they always keep up with their standards . their sashimi is fresh no matter what time i go . their servers are attentive and are always ready to serve you . my fiends love going here and even bring their kids . i would recommend this place to anyone who 's looking for a good place to eat !
asian	i 've been here twice since i 've moved into my new neighbourhood and i am in love ! ! the service is great , the portions are filling , and the products get delivered fast to the table . this is an ayce sushi bar which seems to be the only one near me and is worth the 2 block walk south down yonge street . i enjoy how they also take the time to explain everything to us and what is in their specialty rolls . the place itself isn 't the biggest but knows how to make serving their clts # . will i be back ? ? , for sure : )
asian	i 've been in vegas now for about a year and a half and this is hands-down the best thai in the city ! the building is so-so , but really , it 's all about the food --- and they do it well .
asian	i 've been struggling to find a good sushi spot since i moved here and am thrilled this place just opened minutes from my house . such fresh fish ( nigiri and sashimi were so good ) and delish rolls ! they use " black rice " which i was weary about but wow , i 'm a fan now ! what really made this place top notch , though , was the service . the sushi chefs were fun and playful and the servers were so friendly and willing to answer questions / make suggestions . i am definitely going to become a frequent visitor !
asian	i usually get the # 9 pho w / brisket & tenderloin and the egg rolls . the broth is slow cooked daily . the herbs are fresh and the pho is delicious . the staff is very friendly and attentive . i live several miles away but it 's worth the trip even though there are several pho restaurants along the way . plus there is a great bakery and market nearby to walk around after dinner . they also have delicious tea ( hot or iced ) which is a nice break from the usual soda pop .
asian	i 've been to japan and have had traditional okonomiyaki ( hiroshima and osaka style ) - this is just as good , in my opinion . read other reviews say it 's nothing like what you find in japan - my guess is , is that they 've never been to japan . this place is awesome !
asian	i want to go back to vegas just to have dinner here again ! the curry was delicious , plus a full bar . so authentic ! !
asian	i was a little sceptical going in as i had never tried foods such as pork belly , but it was incredibly delicious ! i loved all of the food i tried except for the ram ' n ' cheese ( it was ok , just not something i 'd personally recommend ) . everything else was great ! the pork belly , sweet potatoe bird nest , soy garlic wings - outstanding ! the service was great as well . being my first time here , the food they recommend was delictable and they were very friendly . i definitely recommend eating at seoul food meet co .
asian	i was craving a sandwich and i have never had bahn mi before and i picked the best place for my first time . i went for the bánh mì thit nuong and it was amazing ! ! ! ! so good can 't wait to try all the other ones . i also ordered online
asian	i was craving pho today to cure my hangover so i made my husband take me here . i love how we don 't have to drive to chinatown for a good bowl of pho . the pho was delicious and hit the spot . my husband got the pork chop which was just as delicious . and service was quick and friendly . i 'll definitely be back .
asian	not only is the food amazing , but their service is fantastic also ! a must try for anyone who likes chinese ! skip panda and come here : better prices and a way better taste . my new every other day spot for me ! keep up the awesome work !
asian	i was searching yelp for decent chinese food and definitely satisfied with this restaurant ! i ordered delivery thru this app , was estimated 60 minutes and extremely pleased when a knock on our door came after less than 30 minutes ! food was fantastic with huge portions ! we ordered orange chicken , combo platter , teriyaki chicken , bbq pork fried rice and sweet and sour pork . also came with 3 containers of white rice , fortune cookies and plenty of different sauces . price was very reasonable . we ordered way to much for 3 people , plenty of leftovers ! definitely going to be our go to for chinese food !
asian	i was very skeptical in trying this but i order the brisket sandwhich and the marinated korean beef covered fries with the green tea with mango fruit . omg. best meal ive had in years ! the drink was sooo good too ! pretty good with the little jel balls and fruit . will be ordering again soon !
asian	i went last night with my fiancé , the food is delicious and the service great ! i strongly recommend to leave room for the crepe jubilee , it is so so good !
asian	i would definitely come back here when i visit vegas ! ! ! dragon roll and kiss of fire is delish !
asian	i would even go as far to say this place is comparable to din tai fung in socal . came here for lunch and it was crowded but the wait was minimal . servers were attentive and we ordered as soon as we sat down . food came out quickly and was paced so that our table for two wasn 't ridiculously crowded with food and no room to eat . loved the beef scallion pancake rolls despite being an eater who shuns greasy fried foods ( it wasn 't greasy at all ! ) . flavorful shumai and xlb as well as the pork noodles . love the hand drawn noodles . so amazing ! i 'm drooling all over again !
asian	i would go back here again , the food was amazing and large portion sizes . i really liked the privacy booths with curtain , i feel like the decor is great but can be better and the restaurant has alot of potential to be just that much more better !
asian	definitely on the pricey side but they have unique dishes .. like pigs ear [ tasted fatty , i don 't recommend it , but it 's quite popular ] . the green tea soba noodles were different and really good . i would come back here for that . overall , they have a wide selection of yakitori and small tapas dishes that are great for sharing . cozy atmosphere as well . great date place . i would come back again but it 's not something i would make into a regular spot i go to .
asian	jackie never ever let 's me down . ive eaten hear at least 50 times and it is always excellent . i east sushi all over the country and this is some of the best i 've found stateside . tip : ask for a spicy smoked salmon skin hand roll . i eat two to three each time . don 't bring a large group but do bring patience as they are busy every day during lunch and dinner . worth the wait !
asian	jackson was our server / bartender ... we had the steak spring rolls and the bang bang shrimp ... wow ! ! we will be back ! cool music and fun atmosphere !
asian	spicy enough , but not overwhelming ( ymmv ) . i had the bulgolgi. the meat was really tender and fresh vegetable , but it was too salty. not a deal breaker because of their amazing appetizers and drink menu .
asian	very generous portion sizes , comfy minimalist interior , and very nice staff . my new favourite neighbourhood casual lunch and dinner spot . i 've been here a number of times and it hasn 't disappointed yet . highly recommended ! ! !
asian	been many times and have always walked away happy . love the grilled dishes - chicken , kobe beef , duck , etc . they always have a blackboard of daily specials - tuna hot pot , salmon belly & other dishes of fresh fish flown in japan . this place gets busy , so call for reservations . heard they are expanding , which is good news for raku fans .
asian	you will be definitely paying premium but you pay for what you get . freshest fish , amazing presentation . these people take so much pride in the presentation and quality of food . our server hein was very knowledgable and made our dinner awesome !
asian	i could have it everyday . clean & courteus service . affordable and delicious !
asian	this is definitely the best japanese meal i have ever had in this city . i 've eaten at many of the ' high-end ' japanese places and for similar prices , this is by far a better value . everything just tastes ' extra fresh ' and is presented beautifully . excellent sake selection and great service .
asian	absolute must visit ! walked in on a saturday evening at 11.45pm without a reservation and they were fully booked ! we luckily got a table thanks to a no-show . the food is delectable . i loved every dish we ordered and will be visiting again ! the staff greet you in chorus when you enter and when you leave , which is a nice touch .
asian	however , the place is really small and usually there is a long line up outside - even on weekdays .
asian	i really loved the freshness of the ingredients as well . i will definitely continue returning to this fine establishment ; )
asian	expensive , but worth it for the freshness , variety , atmosphere and service , make sure to book well in advance .
asian	a bit on the pricy side , but my wife and i made the horrible mistake of sharing the chirashi sushi ! ! should 've ordered two ! !
asian	i went two days in a row becaise their was so many items on the menu i wanted to try . memorable- teriyaki beef tongue , udon with pasta style sauces .
asian	excellent service , food and so clean . it 's so hard to find a good sushi restaurant in this specific area . the sushi is so fresh here and you can definitely taste it . can 't wait to return .
asian	come for the grilled sake fish ! i bring all my guests here to impress . excellent service and cosy atmosphere . it is worth the price and dominates the hype ! !
asian	a little maze to get down but follow the food court signs . definitely worth a visit . i tried the fried ckicen katsu and it blew my mind . japanese curry was tasty . friendly employees . try it out !
asian	the servers are very quirky and offer good suggestions from the menu . the shrimp burger was good and the salmon and tuna rice bowl was as amazing and very unique with strong flavors .
asian	best sashimi and sushi i have ever had in my life ! best service and beautiful environment . i strongly recommend this restaurant for people that value real sushi ! xoxo
asian	food is great and owners are really friendly . only one table for two but i do enjoy eating in a chatting to the owners .
asian	rare find close to home . everything was fresh and tasteful ! the service was impeccable ! one of our dishes came with soup , salad and ice cream . there were two of us so they gave both of us soup , salad and ice cream ! such thoughtfulness !
asian	had the black code which was out of this world . all was great . atmosphere was fabulous . sashimi of salmon and salmon tartar appetizers are amazing . had the gold saki bottle to go with meal .
asian	i love to come here to treat myself as the bill can be a little pricey at the end of your meal , but it 's worth it ! my favourite dish is the fried mushroom balls- they are to die for . highly recommend this place . even my meat eating partner loves to come here !
asian	great food , fresh sushi and awesome drinks . not overly priced , definitely affordable compared to restaurants on the strip and the decor and atmosphere were quite authentic like any izakaya you would experience in japan . great little gem if you have a car in vegas and can drive out to spring mountain road . it 's not far at all , less than 5 minute ride from wynn .
asian	must go ! ! make sure u make reservations bc this place is tiny ! ! ! the food was amazing ... they make their own tagedashi tofu with homemade toppings for it ! my fave was the green tea. had the whole fish sashimi style .. best sashimi ever ! the foie grois an kobe beef skewers on roboto grill amazing ! rice cracker crusted aspargus to so good ! we also had the corn that look like corn on ye cob but the middle was not a cob it was puréed potatoes .. so cute !
asian	at 5 bucks with rice and veggies . though the rice wasn \ t so great . place is tiny . so u gotta u just take-away
asian	$ 6 lunch special is a steal . curry goat is excellent as well. riceis only okay .
asian	jim and i ordered panang curry with chicken , and larb for takeout . each dish had an incredible depth of flavor . what a wonderful find . even if you are not in the area , go ! just go ! you will be glad that you did . small cafe style restaurant , and very clean .
asian	j 's new spot is finally open . same best sushi in az and amazing staff . if you 've ever had sushi in hawaii you know how good it can be and j has found a way to produce the same quality and even better ... in az . i have never been disappointed and i always end up ordering more because it 's so good . try it and you won 't be disappointed , they even have a full bar with liquor , will be here every week !
asian	i 've tried pho restaurants but none of them serve there spring rolls noodles as good as they do . i 've tried their new restaurant and its even better . can 't find better prices for authentic vietnamese food anywhere .
asian	just amazingly great ！ fried banana ice cream is so good and just for 3.99 the ice cream is the real fruit pineapple ice cream ! love it so much ! strong recommendation !
asian	it is tricky to get a reservation , good luck !
asian	just go . it 's the best curry i 've ever had . if you haven 't tried japanese curry , hurry here and order the regular tonkatsu curry . go .
asian	just like a grandma who loves you and shows it through cooking food for you this tiny little restaurant has that same feel . food is great , clean , ohhhh great place . please come and support is place , this place is freaken great . get the kimchi pancake damn it 's good .
asian	the katsu is fantastic and the service was awesome . try an aloha steak if you get the chance !
asian	my dad loves this place and wanted to eat chous as soon as he got off the plane from sfo . chandler is closed on wed so we drove here and when we arrived they had just closed for the afternoon at 3 ! ! oh no ! but the staff was so nice they let us stay and order because i told them how much my dad loved their food . we happened to see the owner there who remembered my dad . food was consistent as chandler and the decor and ambiance was lovely ! it 's like the chandler loc with a face lift .
asian	just moved from scottsdale and i travel to la weekly . this has to be the best thai food hands down ! seafood combination tom yum / shrimp spring rolls / chicken satay / chicken mee grob . first time and i will be back weekly . the best
asian	extremely fresh and terrific service . and this was only their second week of business , when restaurants usually have a hard time getting going . this place is going to be a hit !
asian	melts in your mouth . the accompanying radish was a bit too salty though . and the side dishes were limited compared to other korean restaurants in north york . ja jian noodles were also great !
asian	good alternative to cafe moda if you prefer private rooms .
asian	i 've eaten katsu in japan and katsuya is the closest thing to japanese katsu i 've ever had ! 5 stars ! will definitely be going back !
asian	also recommend the beef tataki and chicken katsu sliders .
asian	it 's not all you can eat , but it is well worth the price ! the meat just melts in your mouth and the service is great ! they come around and help you cook the meats . you basically get it served to you ! the quality of the meats is worth the price . i would definitely recommend this spot and i 'll be coming back often .
asian	the marinated kalbi is to die for ! if you 're lazy like me feel free to get them to cook it for you .
asian	the sides are always nice and are changed / different all the time . everything is fresh and prepared nice . friendly staff and the customer service is great . they do have a " white " broth for soups which i find funny since i am not korean . all and all it is my fav spot in chinatown for korean bbq .
asian	definitely worth trying if you 're in doubt . place is a bit small but once you 're seated , service is fast . i ordered the premium set and it was somewhat on the pricier side but it was great !
asian	make sure to try the ramen also . quality meat and seafood ! definitely coming back .
asian	love the pineapple beef ! one of the best bean paste soups as well .
asian	meat was so tender ! i do not normally eat beef but when i do , i have high expectation . the meat quality and taste is definitely delicious and perfect ! we enjoyed it so much , although far from home , we will come back the next time we visit las vegas !
asian	really yummy self serve salad bar . fresh meat with your usual sticky rice . very helpful service would love to come back here !
asian	went there with my sister , brother in law , brother and his girlfriend whom has never had korean bbq before so we went there after hours in vegas . my brother ordered way too much of everything as he 's a chef himself and wanted to try it all and was in love ! normally very critical because he 's a chef himself but enjoyed it all and ate it all .
asian	among the best kimchi we 've ever had . beautifully presented dishes that taste just as wonderfully . great service , as well . highly recommended !
asian	get the black bean noodle . had the chicken katsu as well . it 's too good . this place rocks
asian	hidden gem in saint-laurent . super lucky ! i 've tried many dishes here ; ramyun , bulgogi , galbi , bibimbap , tteokbokki . all of them are delicious ! : d a must go ! it 's also nice that it 's a family-owned restaurants . the owners a such nice people !
asian	amazing korean food , however they are known for thier fish and chips .. it 's a bit pricey but overall very good .
asian	probably one of the best restaurants in c-u . their soups and stews are great . i never expected to find anything this good ( and authentic , i 've been told ) out here in the cornfields . and it 's not even expensive ( ok , it 's not like one of the hole-in-the-wall type places in campustown , but for a restaurant , it 's very affordable ) .
asian	we went twice while in town and the stone pot bibimbop was so amazing ! i loved the vegetables they put in there ! the pot could have been a little hotter because i want my rice to get crunchy . no crunch : ( but it was delicious anyways ! the employees are very helpful and we loved that they were so helpful with my boyfriends allergy to sesame seeds ! we didn 't try any desserts because we were so full from the main course ! if you 're in the mood for good korean food , try this place ! it 's small inside but worth the wait .
asian	their sliders are worth a try as well . just a good tasty slider that leave u wanting a 4th . ambiance is asian casual modern feel .
asian	definitely worth a stopping by if you 're craving something spicy to tantalize your taste buds !
asian	amazing laksa soup fabulous papaya salad delicious gf desserts very flavourful and unique great ambience & music at resto which has an awesome vibe and authentic decor
asian	lamb was perfectly cooked and so flavorful . that rice though ! i would kill for their rice . so delicious . still thinking about my meal a week later .
asian	last time i had good korean bbq was in la ....... this one wins ten fold ! ! ! ! ! delicious
asian	i had the most delicious soup here . a nice rich beef broth with a bunch of different dumplings , tender beef and bok choy . the service was fast and polite . i 'll need to visit and try other dishes but so far i can say this is my favourite chinese restaurant downtown ( not counting dim sum places ) .
asian	absolutely try the chicken katsu sandwich , it 's outta control . the salmon i 've ordered is always fresh . everything we 've tried is super tasty and keeps bringing us back ! cocktails are great too . i wish this place could stay a hidden gem !
asian	love the matcha drinks here , and the yuzu hot chocolate is my favourite : subtle , smooth and not overly-sweet in the best possible way . the shop is very small , but that helps it feel cozy and like the hidden gem it definitely is !
asian	( yes , i know that is the quintessential standard and i haven 't ' truly ' tried their food , but it is my standard comparision for thai restaurants ! ) couple that with friendly servers and a decent beer / wine list , and this is a place that i plan on revisiting , and revisiting soon . for 5 stars , i would either want a slightly better price / combination options or a full bar . it 's neither upscale dining , or inexpensive . still great great great food though !
asian	the pork katsu curry was to die for . the restaurant was clean , the table wasn 't sticky like most . the staff was friendly and dressed up for halloween . i dumped too many sesame seeds in my bowl , will do less next time .
asian	had the crusted wasabi filet - go with medium . still succulent and delicious , chef cooks more on well side . the miso sea bass is to die for with so many wonderful flavors ( very buttery soft / just melts in your mouth . a few side notes - go for the lobster wontons as they are absolutely amazing ! a few cocktails that is recommend are the orchid and espresso martini . just ok cocktails were the bubbles and berries : orchid . try to get a seat on the upper level for a view of great buddha . enjoy and ask for sweet server annie . she was a great blend of helpful and kind !
asian	while waiting they offered tea and were very hospitable while i was there . food is always on point got the dinner for two and it 's a deal for the price
asian	amazing little cozy place : ) very tasty food with amazing presentation and great service to go with it ; ) what more can you ask for ; ) 10 / 10
asian	first time there we have superb service , awesome food , and lots of laughs . this might be my favorite ayce sushi in las vegas . they are less expensive than the majority of sushi places in town and the quality is top notch . the chefs really care about the food and the staff are attentive and listen well . must try the pork belly and the jalapeño roll . the japanese lasagna was amazeballs as well . for $ 23 for ayce .... you can 't beat it .
asian	i was my first time there & went strictly from the yelp reviews & it was right on ! super delicious , inexpensive for lunch & the waiter made me feel super welcome ! outstanding service
asian	great food at very reasonable prices . they have a patio in the back which you would think would command much higher prices ... i recommend the grilled-chicken pho , but haven 't been dissapointed by anything here .
asian	don 't miss this place , their food is crazy fresh . i had the curry poke which was amazing with lots of veggies . i had the suggested extra scoop of chicken . i ordered a combo of the two drinks together : limeade snd tea , which was delicious . i would suggest a better option for a plate , as the food is served in a tiny bowl and you only get bits of one flavor at s time . will return and spread the word for sure !
asian	i loved it ! will absolutely be returning . all of the rolls we ordered were simply delicious ! wait staff was very attentive and we had a blast ! can 't wait to go back . update . went back and enjoyed it more than the first time ! my husband ordered the philly and scorpion roll , and i had the caribbean roll and the volcano roll . absolutely amazing ! this place does not disappoint !
asian	amazing little japanese place ... they excel in hibachi ... the gentleman who does the grill is quite skilled ... sushi is okay to good ...
asian	also , the family that owns this gem is so kind ! if you live in oakland and you haven 't been here yet , i 'm not sure what you 're waiting for .
asian	hands down the best pho i 've ever had out to eat . fresh ingredients , made quickly and oh so good . sometimes i dream about it . the fresh rolls they make are awesome as well . this place is fantastic for vegetarians . while there are three vegetarian options , they are never cross contaminated and taste amazing . also , the pho is all you need in your dining experience , just saying . it 's that good . i can 't emphasize enough , try the pho ( meat eaters and vegans ) . my boyfriend and i love dining here and we are able to suit both our diets with this menu .
asian	will definitely come back for more ! sushi was nice and fresh and my boyfriend ( who spent a year in japan and is a sushi snob ) said he enjoyed his food . server noticed that i was ordering all vegetarian sushi and sent some fried tofu to our table on the house ! can definitely stand behind the " yelpers love us " stickers that are posted in the windows .
asian	our server sarah was friendly , knowledgeable and a hoot ! she made great recommendations and knew what we needed before we asked . they had a great selection of teas to suit everybody . and delicious savoury and sweet treats to complement the selection . the ambience was very old english . i felt transported to my grandma 's tea room but in a good way . loved that they try to make it feel authentic . would definitely come back here .
asian	make a reservation if you are coming . this is the real deal , no sushi will be good enough after this one
asian	no wait when i went but very huge portions with reasonable prices . ordered the fried rice , chili chicken and chicken pokora . all together came up to 35 including tip . went to this place 2 times after . pretty quick in service if the place isn 't busy .
asian	great people who give great service . i 've become a regular and they truly care and get to know their customers . i highly recommend it !
asian	dumplings are the best traditional ones i 've had outside of mainland china . thin exterior , that perfect hint of cilantro , just the right amount of meat and served with black vinegar and sesame oil ! they mix things up with dumplings of the day and also offer an excellent cucumber salad to freshen things up . a must if you are in the area during the weekday . try to arrive just a few minutes before noon as office workers around there flood in at noon and can quickly cause a lineup !
asian	i took my daughter with me for a quick bite and we had the incredible shrimp spring rolls and orange puffs ( chicken ) . for my entree , i had the ginger mint duck salad . while it was pretty tasty , it was really lacking in duck and the pieces were small and mixed in . next time , i 'll try something other than the duck salad , but overall great place and will be back !
asian	everything i 've tried here is delicious . it is consistently good and the people that work here are so friendly ! i usually order tofu and vegetable pad thai and it is made perfectly with just the right spiciness . i love the food and feel like my business is appreciated . i highly recommend this place ! !
asian	this place is definitely a great option for fast no nonsense decent chinese food . really i have been coming here for a while and have never been unsatisfied with the food or service . in a perfect world they would fix up the bathroom a bit ( please ) but hey it is china town and a family run business . i am not going to with hold a single star - just " go " before you go there
asian	had the fried rice and crab rangoon both were awesome ! definitely try this for your next dinner ! !
asian	this place looks like a dive , but do not be fooled by outward appearances . they are always busy , because they are good ! and chinese food delivered , in mesa , az ? awesome ! we are new , happy customers for life .
asian	and super big good portions ! ! love the new look . really inviting and open and bright because of the windows . love that you 're able to make your own kine fried rice ! ! get your fried rice with kim chee ... winnahs ! !
asian	amazing location and great service and you will enjoy the experience and the atmosphere and excellent food , try the children and beef and shrimp and everything very high recommend ! !
asian	order the cheetah roll . it 's great ! ! enjoyed a great conversation with the manager . also ask for the fresh wasabi , it 's super spicy n yummy
asian	looks like a hole in the wall , but man , is the food ever delicious . i highly recommend bbq pork and the sausage . you can get meat of your choice on rice to eat as a meal . only $ 6 . i have also bought extra bbq pork to have in the fridge . i pound is $ 7 . if you are near , this place is a must . ( it 's the plaza with the mcdonald . )
asian	loved every item we ordered . i read a lot about the ginger chicken but was iffy about the ginger . incredible dish ! crispy beef is pretty delicious as well . spring rolls were crispy and full of goodness . big portions great tasting food their beef dishes melt in your mouth too ! fast service and friendly
asian	love mongolian , but this one is by far the best i 've been to ! got to mix my own sauces too . dinner comes with a drink , rice , soups and frozen yogurt ! the staff was very personable and helpful . highly recommend ! !
asian	love the atmosphere inside and the staff are lovely . opening up all over vegas ! great concept . and the poke bowl was to die for !
asian	love the food ! owners are so nice and personable ! not too pricey lunch menu ! check it out !
asian	love their diablo roll , but everything i 've tried so far is really good . recommended hands down !
asian	love the late night menu pricing . starts at midnight ! go already . best teppanyaki i 've had so far and the fried rice they make you with your meal is amazing
asian	love the steak and the butterfish tataki ! ! pricey but so worth it !
asian	beef bowl , agedashi tofu my usual orders ! cant wait to go back
asian	love this place ! had the panko fried catfish ... it was awesome . get both sauces cause you won 't be able to decide which one is best ! red curry was bomb ! !
asian	amazing , love this place , one of the best restaurants in vegas , try the salmon curry , delicious ! ! !
asian	one of my favorite places in town . will be back again . if say probably the top indian place in henderson . the chicken curry is super good . it does get busy so the weekends so plan to wait a few for a table .... but it 's worth it .
asian	every dish is tasty , service is fast , staff is friendly and you get a lot of food for your buck ! my go to spot for authentic thai . my favorite dish is the coconut curry .
asian	i 'm not leaving toronto go to to this place for lunch or anything , but if you work in the area , this is a great option ( even for vegetarians ! ! ! ) . all lunch specials come with spring roll , mango salad or soup ! ! !
asian	had the oysters and okonomiyaki , they were both delicious . this place is a welcome addition to the junction . i can 't wait to go back !
asian	amazing lunch menu , great food , fresh fish , wonderful service , great price i am simply enjoying my visit here highly recommend !
asian	i highly recommend the sashimi is so fresh and delicious . the place is so simple and beautiful . highly recommend
asian	the food is super cheap , lunch is $ 5.55 with a drink , or about $ 6.50 for dinner with a ton of food . the ingredients are all fresh , none of this sitting in a pot stewing all day . the veggies taste farm fresh and they make everything right when you order it . the staff is friendly and the service is good . family owned and operated , and the portions are appropriately sized . the only thing lacking is the atmosphere , which is to be expected at the price point , i just hate that they serve gyros and chicken wings and what not , it kinda kills the vibe of their absolutely excellent cheap chinese .
asian	great service , awesome food . can 't ask for anything better , except to make sure the soup is nice and hot . i got a lil bit of a cold one recently . but otherwise , i will return over and over again .
asian	this is the perfect lunch spot when you are craving sushi but you don 't want to break the bank .
asian	we ended up taking half of the meal home . great price . we have lived nearby for around a year and just now tried this hidden gem . close to albertsons and worth the search . i wasn 't a fan of the salad dressing but everything else was delicious !
asian	eggplant dishes were amazing , lots for the little ones to eat if they are not into these dishes
asian	kenny was hands down the best server we have had here ! very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu . we loved the nuclear bomb roll and shashimi salad !
asian	very reasonable $ wise . good ambiance considering the locale . loved their fish curry with roghni naan . flavorful tandoori chicken . rice was on the spicy side but maybe it 's just me . i 'm a foodie and i thoroughly enjoyed the food , which was made fresh at the time . did i mention i was there around 9 : 45ish ? ( p.m ) - on a week night . two thumbs up guys ! ! went here again today for lunch pick up and for $ 11 - he gave me 2 roghni naans and fish curry in a very re-usable container along with salad and samosa and rice ! big portion size and definitely worth a trip .
asian	lychee martinis and the wings are a must but you can 't really go wrong with anything you order at this standout !
asian	pho an spring rolls ( i had shrimp only ) hit the spot - i an from the san francisco bay area and have been looking got good pho here in the valley and this is it ! ! ! ! thank you sk for opening out here in the west . you saved me : ) so excited to have many more dishes . * note : they have an awesome bar menu too .
asian	i even got to try jelly fish which was surprisingly scrumptious . i recommend having a reservation as we luckily got a seat at the bar on a tuesday evening but i 'm sure it 's only busier on the weekends and i can see why .
asian	and the staff is fantastic ! ! ! boba tea & snoh ! recommend the thai tea flavor in both !
asian	you definitely pay a premium but it is worth it . this is the best bbq pork that i 've had in canada .
asian	we had a take out done last night and they delivered it to our home nearby ( airbnb ) . the prices are remarkably cheap and quality and quantity of the food was very good . we 're definitely patronizing this place again during our 4 day sojourn in montreal . the only gripe was that the delivery man took 20 extra minutes and didnt even apologize for the delay . result = low tip .
asian	our waitress angie is so accommodating and friendly-- and her recommendations are spot on ! ! ! i especially loved the marinated chicken -- the pork belly -- and all the sides but especially the fish cakes ! ! ! this is a korean barbecue so it makes it really fun to cook the meat right at the table ! ! ! this is a great restaurant for a family dinner ! ! !
asian	furikake chicken is a must ! roast pork loco moco is yummy !
asian	stopped in for lunch and snagged a spot at a shared table for the two of us ( definitely looks like one of those small places that could get crowded really fast ) . very reasonable prices for some very good food ... was in a rush to get back to work , and the food came out quickly / service was great . wonderful spot !
asian	friendly staff and they are all willing to answer any questions . their lunch buffett is definitely the best i 've had in a long time . great curries ! fresh food and comfortable environment . you won 't leave hungry !
asian	i am now a believer in the lotus of siam 's hype ! the steak tartare salad was awesomely yummy ! the beef jerky was out of this world ! those two were my favorite ! everything else were scrumptious too .
asian	everything was fresh and tasty . the service was stellar as well . for some reason we didn 't expect to be blown away , but we were . so glad we chose to dine here . next time we won 't eat the food so fast that we don 't get photos of our rolls .
asian	the food is always fresh , generous , and filling . there hasn 't been a roll i ordered that i didn 't enjoy , and i leave stuffed to the gills and happy as a clam . ( though , come to think of it , clams probably don 't have the self-awareness to know if they 're happy ) . i say just go on to sushi j for your sushi needs . figure out clam feelings later .
asian	the buckets taste like you 're in thailand and the pad tai is the best i 've had since i 've been back !
asian	and probably the best chinese food i 've ever had . best cream cheese wontons ever ! . it 's a shame that was just visiting that side of town and i don 't live there . i would eat it as often as i could .
asian	lulu definitely edges out l & l with content , flavor , and quality good . i 've eaten here about 12 times this month alone and the the 9.95 bbq mixed plate its flawless . with the choice of 2 meats ; bbq chicken , beef , short ribs , chicken katsu , and shrimp you can 't go wrong . personally , my favorite order is the katsu w / bbq beef . also the honey chicken katsu misubi .
asian	the laarb was fun to eat with the refreshing flavor of the various greens herbs and spices . we left very happy .
asian	expensive omakase menu so not something to do regularly but great for special occasions . took my wife here for our anniversary . they gave her a hand carved radish flower . beautiful and a nice touch . every dish was delicious and the portions were good . i was concerned at first that i would still be hungry but there was plenty of food .
asian	also loved the masa maki rolls ! this is the best sushi place i have found in az .
asian	the fish , veggies and rice and seasonings are wonderful i live far from this restaurant and make the trek about once a week as it has become addicting .
asian	every bite is an adventure ! great host and service . the best sushi and shshimi i ever had in arizona !
asian	sashimi was heavenly . i found the place through a groupon deal and we 'll definitely be retuning . so good .
asian	amazingly fresh fish , fast service , truly a wonderful spot , give these guys a chance , very very good food !
asian	i have eaten here over a handful of times and i am always impressed by their quality of fresh veggies . the food is seasoned and cooked perfectly . never soggy veggies . i 've had the pho , bowls , spring rolls , stir fry and dessert and love them all . you will not be disappointed with the quality of food and service . i love supporting small businesses ! go enjoy ! !
asian	we ordered a combo of 12 oysters in four different types , spending 30 $ in total . the guy served us was so kind and welcoming . he explained the taste of each oyster and the the differences as well . ah and don 't forget to try the lobsters ! they 're freshly steamed and so chewy but in a tender way ! definitely will dine there again !
asian	a very nice surprise for uptown sushi . lovely owner and wait staff . clever creative dishes .
asian	a bit on the pricey side for the amount you get , but worth it if you go every once in a long while for a special occasion . i would definitely return , but not for awhile as it hurts the pocket ! the sashimi here is melt-in-your-mouth , and every piece is to die for ! makes you want more ! service is great as well , and the restaurant is very clean ! a bit small , but it 's intimate and great for a date !
asian	the service was so good . we were there last night for dinner . affordable and the ambiance was modern and chic !
asian	not too many options but so worth it . not too expensive and completely delicious . have been many times already .
asian	we came in happy hour 4-6pm . great prices and great food . skip the buffet and come here instead . you won 't be disappointed .
asian	delicious food for a good price ! definitely coming again soon !
asian	fast and delicious . was a freezing day and the minute i sat down they welcomed me with tea and soup . amazing food and huge plates ! ! !
asian	don 't discount it as i did based upon the name and location , this place is really excellent ! the pho is fantastic and the spring rolls are really superb !
asian	this is definitely a new hidden gem for those living at loggia condos , or other residents in the area . the best news is that the portions are generous , and the pulled pork or pulled chicken isn 't drowning in sauce , in fact , you get to choose the amount that 's right for you ! and , make sure you get the gold sauce , it 's unique and unbelievably great flavour . in the famous words of arnold schwarzenegger " you will be back " ... for sure ! !
asian	i was in the bally 's hotel and this was very close by . the atmosphere is excellent and the setting was great . i stuck with the seafood and was more than satisfied . finished with a crepe and coffee - a very good meal indeed . will come back again ! !
asian	super friendly service as well ! the beef rice bowl ( $ 7.95 ) here is so good ! based on the name you might think it 's just a bowl of rice with beef on top but it 's not ! the bottom base layer is rice , followed by a layer of some lettuce and cucumber , then piled on is the japchae , and then the beef along with other toppings such as bean sprouts , fish cake slices , seaweed , and 2 dumplings . lastly , it gets topped off with some sauces . everything was flavorful and it came in a very generous portion . there is limited seating here ( about 6 seats ) . cash and debit only !
asian	was going to see le reve and had reservations at andrea 's at 6pm but we felt it was cutting it close to our 7pm show so we tried wazuzu instead and couldn 't be any satisfied with the service and food . great ramen , lo mein and dim sums .
asian	super friendly staff . i don 't think i need to elaborate beyond that because 1. this place has 450 reviews at the time of this review and 2 . i 'm on my ipad .
asian	amazingly good for a hidden bar in a convenience store , outstanding value. fresh fish , gets all the basics right , great service. the only sushi joint thats probably better is yuzu for 2-3x price. i live in the area and go at least twice a week .
asian	near discount theater at 27th ave and bell ! i was so impressed with the variety on the menu and quality of the food . also , the chinese food here was outstanding . very reasonable price ! can 't wait to go back . i am tired of paying $ 11 per sushi roll when i can pay $ 6 here .
asian	the service was good and the food was a real find in this strip mall . pleasant decor
asian	this place is a hit with japanese ! apparently , they filmed a japanese reality tv series here . a master sushi chef digused himself as an employee learning the art of sushi making . of course , there was a grand finale when the chef revealed who he really was ! then taught them the real art of sushi ... and it shows ! decor is somewhat lacking , but makes up for it in the food ! try the firecrackers ! ! ! ( jalapenos stuffed with spicy tuna ) ... yummy .
asian	i can 't recommend much from the menu however as i always order the hibachi chicken served with broccoli , fried rice and sliced carrots ( yes , carrots , which are in fact addictive ! ) speaking of addictive , all entrees are served with their own house-made shrimp sauce . the servings are enormous and consistently prepared . the dining area is very plain but that 's okay as the focus here is the food . hungry and need a quick meal ? thus place is a " gotta try " ! .
asian	i had one of their specialty dishes , a vietnamese veggie mix with shrimp added , hot . served with rice , it was amazing . great service and ambience . def need to get back here to sample more of their huge menu !
asian	i 'm so spoiled by the portion sizes at sakana that i don 't want to eat sushi anywhere else . the fish is always fresh . be sure to check the specials on the board - you could try something new ! the staff is fantastic and efficient . sit at the bar and you 'll see how friendly the chefs are . buy them a shot of sake and you 'll have friends all night . plus a lot of attention from the entire restaurant . for dinner there 's typically a wait for a seat . but sakana is always worth the wait . if you really can 't wait , make a to-go order . you 'll keep coming back .
asian	great to be off the strip . eat like the locals do ! i chose the ronin burger , which was angus beef , caramelized onions , coleslaw , miso goma dressing , fried egg , katsu bbq yuzu citrus aioli . she got the kalbi burger and we shared an order of the oxtail chili cheese fries ( garlic aioli and fried egg ) . next time i will definitely try another burger or the duck buns . i actually finished the whole burger , it was so good . such a treat .
asian	great food , at prices that is up to par with the food ! suggest this place of you just want to try something good that 's affordable , filling , or just something new . my new goto spot close to home .
asian	the fish is always fresh . and the chefs fly the food out to the table . never a wait .
asian	little heavy on the rice for the sushi , and it 's never super cold ( which i liked ) . my favourite thing to get is the dynamite rolls ! love the staff here , always nice and pleasant . great place for a cheap bite to eat , pretty good sushi all around !
asian	as soon as you walk in and sit down you 're instantly greeted by friendly staff ! the rolls are absolutely delicious and the all-you-can-eat special is right on point . the chefs are really awesome and the overall feel is just great . really recommend if you love good sushi !
asian	great food , all hot & absolutely delicious . rice & noodle is my # 1 spot for chinese food in vegas .
asian	a must try for lovers of meat and flavor . don 't forget to order a bottle of soju or a soju cocktail . will be here every time i visit .
asian	there 's a pretty artificial waterfall garden behind glass for the view . the portions are japanese-sized so you will end up spending quite a bit of money if you eat more than that . the service was very good , and they did their best to serve a large amount of food to our party within a relatively short amount of time so we could make our show appointment . i highly recommend the sushi platter and the chocolate mask dessert .
asian	we stopped in late one evening while visiting vegas and we were glad we did . all our food was good and very worth the price .
asian	we didn 't need to go for the all you can eat option . the personal table bbq portion is a plenty . the service was also great . they taught us the proper way of eating korean bbq !
asian	i got the basil martini with the egg rolls as an appetizer . soooo delicious ! for dinner the bf and i got the pad thai with chicken and shrimp to share .... however .... we love to eat so i recommend not sharing and getting your own separate plate lol : - ) definitely will be returning soon !
asian	food was over the top , we tried many of the dishes like the mushrooms the duck tacos beef udon uni and all were amazing . the only thing we didn 't like was the lobster risotto . if you are a goofy or just love great japanese food you have to go .
asian	service was efficient and the price was reasonable . great experience
asian	great portions + delivery , just perfect . an add on to my favs for a lazy / cozy evening at home .
asian	everything we ordered was fresh and delicious . the service was beyond great . i absolutely recommend checking it out , you won 't be disappointed !
asian	the basil fried rice was worth the trip ! the staff was attentive and flexible with my friend 's requests . all good !
asian	the decor is interesting and makes for a fun ambiance . best cocktail i have had in a long time . the egg custard was truly special . will absolutely go back .
asian	the dishes were inventive without being cloying or overly complicated . we had six seafood dishes each better than the last . they were all light but filling . i loved the tuna tartar , hamachi , and scallops min particular . great atmosphere and service as well . not cheap but worth it !
asian	we had to call the waiter over to place our order after waiting for some to me . one thing that happened one of the waitress failed to call out that we had a female at the table . we order sparkling water but they took the bottle away . when we ask for refills they brought a new bottle to the table . we all enjoyed our dinner and would revisit the place again . more attention to the customers would be appreciated next time .
asian	we were delayed seating for about 15 minutes but were offered 3 free drinks ! the rock shrimp appetizer was amazing , and the rolls were really fresh . the portions were small and the place definitely isn 't cheap , but it is definitely worth it .
asian	since finding this place , i no longer marinate my own meats . this is so much easier and tastes soooooo much better thanks bill !
asian	the waiter and manager " jason " we 're very knowledgeable and sincere . and the food , all the way to vegas for the best japanese food i have ever had and the service too ! ! wow
asian	this place is my favorite thai food in vegas . the spicy beef salad is just amazing here .. the best i 've had anywhere . i love to go here for dinner before seeing a show on the strip . service is decent , food is great , atmosphere is .... acceptable ( never been a fan of plastic plants myself , but as long as they 're not dusty ... )
asian	amazing menu selection. they sort the menu by lunch and then by meat , weight watchers , fried rice / lomein , etc. very kind staff and food tastes great .
asian	truly legit thai ! so underrated ! they go way beyond the basic stuff to feature authentic thai cuisine with varying levels of spice . it 's overshadowed by the other restaurants but this has been the best meal at the aria !
asian	very nice place and the happy hour will be worthwhile ! i enjoyed the ramen chicken soup and the apple crump cake with green tea ice cream . the asparagus and salmon sushi roll was also great .
asian	might be the best vegas roll i 've ever had ! super fresh , good service and everything we had was incredible !
asian	so close to my job so i 'll definitely be heading here more often . ambience is great and great customer service . 5 stars overall
asian	mini xiao long baos have the best skin to meat ratio ! so good !
asian	amazing miso cod , sashimi sampler is overpriced at $ 120
asian	moved from orlando and have found my sushi spot 5 minutes from home . thank you midori ! gyoza was amazing and the sauce was great on the sushi rolls as well . green tea was fresh ! affordable prices too . great job and will be back
asian	i always bring out of town guests here as a quick stop to refuel , everyone loves it . kalbi beef sub is my favourite
asian	ordered miso ramen , med spice , added corn , seaweed , bamboo shoots and egg !
asian	my bf took me here and it was outstanding ! kelly ( owner ? ) is so nice and friendly . sushi is great and the white peach saki was so good . yes , yes .
asian	my boyfriend and i are here for lunch and we thought it was absolutely delicious ! for sushi we ordered the california roll , spicy tuna roll , & the shrimp tempura roll and we shared the pan-seared tuna for our entree . every dish was just perfect !
asian	my boyfriend and i were looking for some take out so we gave this place a shot . it was so tasty and fresh . we ordered the beef and broccoli , chicken egg rolls and , sweet and sour chicken . this place definitely did not disappoint .
asian	my boyfriend told me a long time ago this was his favorite sushi place so i finally got to take him here for his birthday and was so impressed . it is so cute inside and the sushi is amazing ! even just the simple california roll was outstanding . i didnt read any descriptions on the rolls and just randomly chose the phoenix roll and him and i both were shocked , it was absolutely delicious ! i cannot wait to go back . oh and the shrimp on the 5 dollar tapa menu is soo good . try this place !
asian	my family and i were very impressed . they didn 't have a lot if gluten free options since all the meat is marinated in soy sauce , but i got the vegetarian noodle bowl ( rice noodles , tofu , and veggies with the standard vinegarette dressing ) . i loved it and would definitely order it again .
asian	my favorite meal of our trip ! service was spot on . i started out with the temple salad and my husband the egg rolls . both were phenomenal ! during our stay i had salmon on 3 different nights .. tao was the best ! my husband had filet mignon pepper steak and the steak melted in your mouth . for dessert we had ice cream and chocolate spring rolls ... again .. delicious ! and the fortunes are my favorite . i never tried tao in ny , but now i am going too ! thank you tao for an amazing meal ! !
asian	my favorite place for sushi in vegas . i would eat here 3-4 days per week if i had an unlimited amount of money . this restaurant was opened by the former chef of the highly acclaimed nobu . it might even be better ... definitely a better value for the $ ! ! ! dishes i recommend : black cod hamachi kama ( yellowtail collar ) spicy tuna roll w / eel and avacado on top filet ( toban-yaki style ) white fish carpaccio yellowtail w / garlic ponzu sauce shrimp tempura w / orange chili aoli sauce garlic tuna sushi ( nigiri style )
asian	my favorite pot stickers ! ! the duck amazing . lotus root and squid was great ! i love this place ! !
asian	my favorite sushi place in vegas ! chefs are a blast !
asian	my first time here i was greeted by a nice lady who appeared to be the owner . she explained the menu to me perfectly . i dare you to find a nicer person to represent your business . i ordered the pork belly ( 7.99 ) and the beef skewer . the pork belly was insanely good . came with a perfect sauce and she included this vinegar spicy garlic sauce that was incredible . finally , an authentic filipino place delivering perfect food at perfect prices . we need to make this place successful so they never leave .
asian	my friends and i go here all the time . i usually get the orange chicken because the batter they use is incredible . the country pad thai is also really good ! the service is also great .
asian	my husband and i both use to manage high end sushi restaurants in new york and la , so we can be pretty picky . everything we had was wonderful . the quality and freshness was great . the staff were attentive to us and so gracious with our 4 children . the cold sake was smooth and refreshing . every recommendation made by nick the manager and our server were exceptional , they certainly knew their menu well . this is by far the best experience we have had with sushi in las vegas . it 's become our new found favorite place ! !
asian	my husband and i have been looking for a good vietnamese place since we moved here and we finally found it . everything taste like authentic vietnamese flavors . my grandma would definitely approve ... kudos to the chef ! ! ! the best vietnamese food in vegas is not on spring mountain . it is downtown . food is priced very well . flavors are light and not heavy . who 'd a thunk that ? # buzzybytes
asian	my husband and i have been " take out " from here for the past year . always so relish- and zero mistakes on our order . always order the pho soup- w beef and an order of spring rolls . we decided to stray this week and try recomended pho lein which had great reviews . such a disapointment . when we got home , unwrapped the beef to put into the soup - it was already pre cooked ? ugh . the beef was fatty and tasteless . pho bac- great portion sizes , fresh taste , and delish ! be prepared w / cash only and time to look for parking
asian	my husband and i love to go try the different charlotte restaurants . i 've been wanting to try seoul for a while now but heard bad things from their opening . seoul had some big shoes to fill and they did . our server tony was incredible and answered so many of our questions and had great suggestions . we ordered the beef rib , bao buns , spicy bbq wings & the cracklins . everything was perfect . my husband has been raving about the beef rib to everyone . the atmosphere is perfect as well . we will definitely be back !
asian	my husband and i went to jam on a thursday and had the pleasure of trying hao bao for dinner . we ordered the dumplings , chicken noodle soup , and scallion pancakes . the dumplings were fresh and full of flavor , some of the best dumplings i 've ever had . i can say the same for the chicken noodle soup , you could tell the noodles were homemade , the chicken was cooked perfectly and the broth was awesome . the scallion pancakes were something different , crepe-like savory pancakes . the price is very reasonable too , a fresh , homemade dinner for under $ 10 per person . i would definitely recommend hao bao !
asian	my husband works close by and brought it home one night . we had the shrimp tempura udon and the kimchi udon , the okanomayaki , and the suikiyaki . best udon ever . ever . i was sad when it was all gone ! i can only imagine it 's more amazing when you 're eating it at the restaurant . we will be back ! !
asian	my parents always come here ( literally every weekend ) . they always bring leftovers and its delicious . so i finally came to try it out my self .... amazing ! love this place and their food is delicious !
asian	my parents and i were in vegas for a conference and happened upon this shop and came back for almost every meal . cheap and delicious ! also , great service .
asian	my second visit was as wonderful as my first . i was in vegas with my kids and really wanted to go to tao since it was incredible 18months ago when my husband and i went alone . we made an early reservation and dined ahead of the night club crowd . the food was so delicious . my son who loves asian food said it is the best and my picky daughter left stuffed . chilean sea bass , lobster won tons , spicy wonton soup , vegetable dumplings- everything was fresh , full of flavor and perfectly prepared . the donuts were a tasty ending . the staff was very attentive . the ambiance is great - it is an experience !
asian	my wife and i have had multiple dishes and all have been great . customer service is always on point . the owner is always making time to ensure everything is fine .
asian	i 'll definitely be going back , stimulated new taste buds in my mouth lol
asian	it 's worth the wait . the food is amazing and inexpensive . if you are a dan of anime it 's playing all along the wall behind the full bar . if you aren 't , it 's not intrusive at all . the dj on saturday night is a nice touch
asian	super fresh fish , great service , and delish rolls . this is a once-a-week place for us . highly recommend it ! amazing value .
asian	never been to scottsdale ! first night here , friend took me to this place ! soon as i sat down and started eating , i said to her , ' how are you going to top this the rest of my days here ? ! ' pork belly dish was phenomenal ! ! ! and no joke , the brussels sprouts ! ! omg ! i hate eating brussels sprouts in general and i am so coming back for that @ roka ! i would just fly back here from cali just for this place ! !
asian	never dissappointed , service can be hit and miss with duck being served before the pancakes and green onion and cucumber being served sparingly . other than that a go to favorite !
asian	never had mozzarella cheese deep fried on top of my sushi but it was amazing ! ! the staff is very nice and personal ! place is huge and they rent it out for private parties . 10 / 10 ! !
asian	would . recommend it to anyone . . become one of my favorite places .. i suggest the pho or shaken beef
asian	the miso black cod and salmon collar are must gets , as are the enoki mushrooms . good sashimi as well , and i loved the sharing of a ton of variety of small plates . definitely worth the trip off of the strip .
asian	the prices are very fair for downtown toronto and all the ingredients were fresh . you can customize your own roll / poke bowl or pick off bowls / wraps that have their ingredients firm off the menu . the staff was friendly and worked diligently . the only down part was the wait time which took close to half an hour ) : i 'll definitely be returning after the lunch rush from 12-3pm .
asian	i was referred by a friend who 's been here 2 times since they opened 2 weeks ago . i loved it . my last memorable ramen experience was in hawaii years ago .. this is comparable . cocktails are fantastic . ramen is even better . i def recommend trying their steamed buns . so so delish ! the setting / atmosphere is comfortable and inviting . and 5 star service . everyone is friendly and attentive . it 's a little pricey but worth it for the experience . i will be back to try the sushi and other ramen dishes .
asian	it 's surprisingly tasty and varied . great fusion in sushi types and quality . it is about time we have good sushi around here ! ! ! so bring out your sticks and i pity the fool who ain 't liking this sushi !
asian	when first walking in charidise i was amazed of how big the place is . it was two floors with plenty of seating . rather than being served at your table and paying after you eat , you order and pay at the front and then they bring your food to your table . i ordered the popcorn chicken it was delicious . i also ordered the grapefruit lemonade and i wasn 't disappointed . the only con is that its more pricey compared to other taiwanese restaurants . overall i was very impressed with charidise and will for sure will be coming back in the near future !
asian	the consistency / texture of the hand pulled and knife shaved noodles are authentic and perfect .
asian	my fiance didn 't like the noodles slapping sounds as they were being made but i loved it because i know my noodles are being made fresh ! it 's a pretty small space and it 's often completely packed because of people coming from sick kids but it 's worth lining up for . the mega size easily fed 2 of us and their tea egg and jellyfish were on point . get the second largest round noodles size and spicy broth and you will be in heaven . there 's a hand pulled noodles place on dundas as well but don 't go there this place is infinitely better . will come here a lot !
asian	go a little earlier ( before lunch or dinner time ) to get seats . there are always loooooonnnnnggggg line ups ! edit : someone asked me to share what i ordered . every time i go , i usually just get pho . i don 't exactly remember the name ( sorry ! ) , but it should be the first one on the pho page ! i 'll check again next time i 'm there !
asian	i didn 't take pics about noodles coz the noodles was delicious ! ! when i want to take pics i always ate everything ! ! ! the pot sticker is delicious too ! ! ! !
asian	love the miso ramen ... added seaweed and flavored egg ! yum ! order the pork belly bowl too !
asian	always try to make a stop here when i 'm in town . try the noodle soup with the fishballs .
asian	the spicy dumplings are great as well . the shop is very clean and modern as well . they offer the soups to go as well and they package the soup separate from the noodles so the noodles don 't get too soggy on the trip home .
asian	the dan dan noodle is by far the best flavor i have had , none of the other ones i tried can match . the beef brisket is also very tender and the portions are huge . the sides are also very authentic , like the onion pancake , yummy ! !
asian	the shaved noodles are absolutely bomb . awesome egg rolls too .
asian	cab ride from the strip but worth it . be careful on the spicy level . i did 4 and it was too hot to eat . service was great and our dishes were delicious . had the red chili dip ( not spicy ) , curry , garlic prawns and coconut soup .
asian	nuff said ... l & l hawaiian bbq on steroids . great food , huge portions , friendly staff . place was packed .
asian	nuff said ... try the place you 'll never go back to your neighborhood sushi joint ! ! ! we don 't !
asian	oh my , i had the spicy seafood salad , panang curry w \ beef , and pineapple fried rice . i fell in love .
asian	oh raku , how i love thee ! so glad you are located in las vegas , because otherwise , i may be visiting you all the time . fresh , homemade tofu , foie gras on a stick , uni , fresh sashimi , sake sampler , special import beer ... just a few of my favorite things . and , for all that and more , a $ 45 pp bill . really reasonable ! can 't wait to return to try their special chef 's omakase . it requires letting the chef know ahead of time and i think is about $ 150 a person . i am sure it 'll be decadent and completely amazing .
asian	and for 100 bucks you can 't beat that deal ! i love kabuto and yui but i think this might be my new favorite spot . it 's kinda in a random shopping center on west charleston but not hard to find . feels like the valley almost . go give it a try ! you won 't be disappointed ! !
asian	i have not tried the a la carte here , but the omakase is really good . it 's $ 50 and that is hands down the best bang for your buck for any omakase in toronto . i 've had more expensive ones that don 't compare . their dishes are very simple letting the flavours of the fresh fish and subtle sauces speak for themselves . amazingly fresh sushi and sashimi here . highly recommended !
asian	once we walked in the smell of thailand greeted us ... we ordered pad thai , green curry and lobster , every dish was outstanding ! ! !
asian	one of my favorite places to go get a snack and yummy lemonade . favorite dish : spam musubi . they have a good variety of popping pearls too that you can add to your lemonade . i frequently recommend to friends .
asian	one of my favorite spots in the valley . i crave the ramen even when it 's 110 degrees outside . the belly buns make me happy and a couple cocktails don 't hurt either . i can 't knock anything about this place . try it . you won 't be disappointed .
asian	one of my favorite thai food places . my boyfriend and i go here all the time . great price , speedy service , and your choice of protein and spicy level . i usually get the pad thai noodles and they are exceptional . the amount of food you get is enough to take home for a second meal or snack . unless your like my boyfriend who somehow demolishes everything and doesn 't gain a pound . we also like to finish with mango and sticky rice . omg it 's the most delicious treat ever . i would recommend this place to everyone who loves thai !
asian	one of my favorite thai restaurants ! " so good ! ! we eat thai a lot , and this was one of the best , by far. dragon roll ( amazing ! ) and i had beef red curry . they also brought us a free grilled mackerel that was really good . if you like thai , definitely come here . great service , average pricing , and what i consider to be great thai food !
asian	one of the top places in las vegas for sushi . you can bet on it that i 'll be returning again and again . thanks again everyone at sushi hero .
asian	one stop place for sushi and ramen . the broth was amazing and the sushi was delicious . they also sell japanese snacks and drinks . service was perfect . my new favorite spot ! !
asian	only regret is not going before now . spicy beef noodle is the freshest flavor packed meal i have had in years . lived and worked in san francisco for years . i had given up on finding the same quality chinese food in the valley . i am very happily surprised and will be back
asian	only wish we would have found it sooner ! had the panang and drunken noodles - both delicious .
asian	ordered a beer , tea , cucumber salad , spicy wontons , beef pancakes , dan dan noodles , and chipped beef noodles , all for $ 42 . food was delicious and noodles so fresh . service was fast and friendly . loved the modern ambiance and feel of the diner / restaurant . will definitely return !
asian	ordered delivery . orange beef and spicy kung pow chicken . both with fried rice . so much flavor on both dishes . portion size was beyond ample with leftovers of both . the food arrived piping hot and in less time than expected . delicious ! ! !
asian	ordered delivery through just eat and my order arrived within 15 minutes ! food was fresh and delicious . will definitely order again as i live in the neighbourhood .
asian	ordered the beef lo mein and orange chicken ( last tuesday ) . will be coming back and ordering from them again soon
asian	ordered the omakase , was so fresh that i could taste the ocean . this place is legit .
asian	order everything . i had the french toast . omurice . amazing . dungeonous crab miso chowder . eggs benedict . karaage . needless to say . i was very full . all were good but hands down the omurice is a must get
asian	sauces and noodles from scratch , great pairings , etc .
asian	expertly cooked by friendly staff . you can mix and match your grain / veggies with protein , just like a chipotle type restaurant . i highly recommend you try it if you 're in the area and looking for something new . just fantastic food ! the kimchi sides are spot on as well .
asian	our favorate place ! i highly reccomend the egg hand roll and taro slushie with boba ! this place is yummy , everything is good and the price is so reasonable .
asian	our waiter was so attentive . the food runners were also quick to refill water . we bought 2 entrees and a bottle of wine . ~ $ 100 . we also told them that we were celebrating our first day of marriage and the chef brought us a crime brûlée compliments of the chef . we had a great experience . definitely would recommend !
asian	great fresh sushi . fabulous service . you must try the turkey potstickers . after many of my friends and i got food poisoning from oyshi we have been looking for a new fav sushi spot and mikos will definitely be it ! ! ! will be returning most definitely .
asian	i got the mr miyagi and my brother got the bahn mi , two great choices . sadly they were out of the ramen that day because of a plumbing issue , looking forward to trying it in the near future . updated . tried it again and it was amazing . worth the wait .
asian	change your life ! the chef prepares the beef broth for 15 hours ... that is dedication !
asian	don 't let the strip mall and surroundings fool you . i 'm definitely going back when i 'm in the area . yummy and reasonably priced .
asian	i love this place . it is a little expensive compared to others but the food is worth it !
asian	best thai i 've had in cleveland -- service was excellent and friendly would definitely go back to try other dishes
asian	it 's my new favourite spot . food is quick and taste amazing . never had to wait .
asian	spring rolls sooo yummeee ! all the food in general is very good . very good service as well . food 9 , service 9 , price ... not expensive but not cheap if you know what i mean . it 's a must if you want good thai food in a cool place .
asian	the tofu being fried is a nice touch that i haven 't seen before . the spring rolls are just average but the pad thai is a real winner and it comes at a super reasonable price . large portion too ! most times i share with someone and we both end up satisfied . it is nice when you end up at a table , but when you get seated at the lunchroom style benches near the kitchen the noise becomes quite loud and you are seated rather close to other people .
asian	it 's my favorite ! i usually have it delivered to work ! service is great : )
asian	amazing passion fruit tea , and udon soup ! ! !
asian	little plates are great and similar enough to taiwanese cooking than most places i 've been to , which is nice . the owner is really friendly and the service is quick . we will be back often when we visit az .
asian	amazing , patient and accommodating service at a delicious and affordable chinese restaurant in the heart of toronto 's chinatown !
asian	peach sake is mind blowing . unique and fresh sushi . great service and creme brûlée to die for ! ! ! !
asian	take-out or dine-in , it is absolutely delicious . their curry , ribs , bbq chicken , pad thai , and any appetizer is well with it !
asian	people are awesome and the chicken hit the spot ! ! ! ! love this place ! ! ! i would post pictures , but i couldn 't wait to eat it ! ! : )
asian	just go ! the decor , the service , the food , even the cutlery is lovely . the presentation of the food was beautifully done ( you don 't see much of that at pho restaurants ) . while we were eating our meals , the chef came out and asked us how our food was . this shows how confident the chef is in his cooking , which also makes the customer feel way better about what they are eating . overall it was an excellent dining experience and will definitely be back . oh yeah , the prices are great too ! : - )
asian	perfect for the cold weather c : the broth was delicious , you can tell how much time they put into it and the meat was cooked to perfection . bao were so fluffy and inventive . staff was so friendly and helpful and everything came out quickly for a weekend dinner . great sake collection too . atmosphere was warm and welcoming and the design is spot on . they really put thought into everything you could think of .
asian	period . i had the thai basil with ground chicken . girlfriend had the green curry with chicken . both were outstanding . service was perfect didn 't wait long for our food . just a great experience . we will be back as we finally fond real thai !
asian	phay ling was polite and very patient explaining everything to us , the food was so fresh and delicious , the perfect amount of food to try different plates .... we will go back in a heartbeat , the night before we went to bar masa to have a small bite and the bonnie our server came to tetsu to say hi to us ! ! ! ! they don 't miss a bit ! people in vegas in places that are so great are there because they all deserve it ! ! ! !
asian	a little hole in the wall that serves up delicious , warm pho . can get pretty busy during the week for lunch due to its proximity to concordia and work places but i can usually find a table for two . i come here a couple times a month and the pho never disappoints . it 's also easy on the wallet with prices starting at 7.50 for a small and 9 for an extra large .
asian	and amazing boba smoothies ! natural mango and all ! definitely coming back . friendly staff
asian	they could update the music a bit though . the bee gee ' s
asian	got the chicken pho here and it was delicious . the service was fast and the portions are massive . normally i can finish a medium pho but their medium is like an xl . you get so much rice noodles and chicken that you will be stuffed . price is reasonable as well . can 't wait to come back again !
asian	# 40 is amazing ! the chicken fried rice is exceptional , and the fried egg rolls are very tasty , as well . this place used to be a ' 50s diner , so the ambience doesn 't quite match the venue ... all the more reason to check this place out ! you will definitely be happy with this place . i drive across town just to go here , and it 's always worth it . now that it 's soup season , my family and i will be frequenting lemongrass even more .
asian	i never really eat the meat in pho so i can 't judge . staff is very attentive .
asian	my father and i come here so often the owners know us by name and greet us kindly . i always get the crunchy spring rolls ( they 're to die for ) along with the shrimp pho . my father gets the meatball pho . both are delicious ! since i am unsuccessful with chop sticks the waiters are always able to provide me with scissors so i can use a fork . i love this place and will continue to come back !
asian	the service was super friendly and the pho one of the best i 've had in montreal . i 've tried at least 6 other pho places in the city , this one is on top of the list . i tried both the grilled chicken and the rare beef pho , both were equally delicious . portion is huge , broth is super tasty and their green tea is terrific . this will be my new go-to pho place in ville st laurent
asian	service is quick and everything i 've ordered has been super good . pho ga is especially insane . they always have the news on which is rly depressing but north york ' pho game is definitely poppin
asian	nice , clean and friendly . i would recommend this place to anyone . owner comes over and greats everyone . what a find .
asian	great portion and exquisite broth . though the person i was with got a light portion of meat in theirs compared to mine , wasn 't sure why . we started with the le pho spring roll ( grilled five spice pork , basil , lettuce and scallion oil . ) it was good , different take on roll . like a sushi vietnamese spring roll . i also ordered the house special pho ( a loaded pho with ribeye , flank , tendon , tripe , and meatball ) both were tasty and filling . the pho broth was great . will try the banh mi sandwich .
asian	i always eat here when i 'm in the area ; the food is consistently delicious and reasonably priced .
asian	i had never had this before and didn 't know what to expect but now i am craving it again and will get again soon . we called to place an order to pick up and they said it would be ready in 5 minutes ! ! ! fantastic ! !
asian	i never go any where else . the calamari is amazing and all the pho dishes i 've had have been perfect ! the thai tea is to die for ! oh yum ! ! ! ! ! love this spot !
asian	i ordered the combination and it was wonderful ! it was full of meat and the broth was delicious .
asian	i really like he ambience of the place and the waitress that served my friend and i was very friendly i forgot her name . : / anyway , if you 're looking for a good place to get pho come here ! you 'll enjoy it . : )
asian	it 's a huge serving for 8 $ ! the broth is great and the veggie toppings are fresh . it 's a hole in the wall place in a strip mall but it 's so worth it .
asian	it 's a mist every time i visit town . pho comes in different sizes , and you pick the meats . servers are very nice and helpful . the green papaya salad it 's a must . you won 't be disappointed !
asian	i was almost drinking the broth with a straw . lol . the vermicelli bowl was outstanding as well . will be back for the bahn mi sandwich this weekend . if you like pho , try it here .
asian	amazing pho love this place it 's small but i don 't care , the various times that i been there none never disappointed me ... i will continue to go here and i tell everyone about this spot
asian	if you like hot hot this is the dish . so good .
asian	one of my favourite place in the city . the imperial rolls are amazing ! ! ! the staff is nice and they serve your order in seconds . definitely worth a visit ! ! !
asian	amazing pho , probably the best since most places suck local to me in the dc , md , va area compared to this restaurant !
asian	quick service every time , even when they 're full to the last seat . i don 't know how they do it . the bahn mi is also always so delicious and crunchy . mmmmmm . salivating while thinking about it . their bubble tea is decent too ; i think it 's comparable to koko bakery 's bubble tea down the street .
asian	right by my house ! ! yay ! ! ! i asked for extra jalapeños and boy did they give me extra . # 16 is what i always order and it hasn 't failed to be delicious once !
asian	give it a try , you won 't regret it . the beef combination is a killer !
asian	some of the best in az . the shrimp spring rolls are also delicious ! love this place . i come here probably about 5-6 times a month and would go more often if it was closer to my house .
asian	so so good . we moved here from ca and are huge pho lovers . this place was excellent ! i just wish it was closer to us . very good ! we highly recommend and will be back soon ! !
asian	the place doesnt look so great from the outside , but its great food and service for a good price .
asian	terrific service . they even chopped up a special batch of peppers for me . server made recommendations and really seems to care . has a very family feel . clean and bright . huge menu , in case you don 't like pho . i can 't find a negative anywhere here . we will be back !
asian	they are generous with the meat and the broth is flavourful and delicious . service is fast . i came here for the laksa during dinner and they had ran out - luckily the pho i had instead was a pleasant surprise .
asian	end it with a freshly made macaroon . will visit every time i 'm in the area .
asian	try the chicken with lemongrass - it 's delicious , flavourful , and you can really taste the lemongrass . mmmmm ..... pho ..... they 're not cheap on the portions either - you get a massive bowl of soup even when ordering the regular size . with such affordable prices , you just can 't go wrong . service is quick , so you can be in and out pretty fast if you 're in a hurry .
asian	my family to go place when we want good pho . owner very pleasant always checking to make sure everything is good .
asian	very fresh and great meat quality ! which is not usually common in pho places . the costumer service was great as well and very clean place ! !
asian	we usually split ( extra charge ) the chicken pho and thats more than enough food for 2 people . one of the best pho 's in the valley , give it a shot !
asian	whenever i visit my parents , we drop by this restaurant . very friendly atmosphere , clean and the food tastes fresh . i recommend their bun bo hue ( a spicy noodle bowl ) , if you want to try something different . delicious !
asian	amazing pineapple shrimp salad and avocado roll. very interested in trying out the banana split maki dessert !
asian	might not be the best in the entire world but one of the best in montreal by far . unfortunately opening hours are retarded and there is often a lineup . take out is best .
asian	delivery times are quite long so dine in or pick up if you can .
asian	they have the best lunch special a slice of pizza , salad and soda . great price and great food . staff very nice and the restaurant very clean . can 't wait to go back . delivery service also great and speedy service and have used that many times .
asian	great for eat in or carry out . don 't be scared to try the firecracker sauce , it 's to die for !
asian	ambience not too good but the food covers for it . try the java fried rice it is out of this world . mango chicken was good too . if you like spicy food java fried rice is the best .
asian	a must while in lv . had the tofu and it was perfect even though it was not on the menu . very friendly place .
asian	the taste was amazing loved the food . the food was healthy and make u feel light and energetic after . i also ordered the bean shake with ice that they serve in vetnamiz resturants the test is same as other stores . the woshrooms are decent smelled good nothing super fancy ​ which is fair enough as the prices are low for this restaurant . the radio channel they were running seemed to lag not sure why but maybe it 's for one time problem . will definitely recommend this place for other friends . they have two sided menu one side is vegan one side is not so pick wisly .
asian	look at the pictures , the portions are good , the sushi is fresh ( and half price all day ! ) , beer is a penny friday and saturday nights and ayce not only sushi , but apps like butter calamari and entrees too ! ! i will be bringing my family back , and my friends for sure , in fact , i think i will be going here for my birthday next month ! thank you for places like this , who keep great food affordable in this economy , we need all the help we can get .
asian	our chef was also super nice i knowledgable and i leaned where wasabi comes from and how it 's made : )
asian	anything chef akira does is gold ! ! ! must try .
asian	as a first timer , i will say our server was very helpful in helping us decide what to go for . you have to start off with the mongolian beef pancakes . i had the szechuan chicken with flat noodles , it was to die for . i highly recommend this place !
asian	best sushi i have had in cleveland akron area . good prices . gorgeous presentations ( really that 's the reason to come here ! ) wait staff attentive and kind . beautiful decor . a must try ! !
asian	best sushis ! i loved the avocado salad ! also the warm saki tastes great ! definitely recommend it if you 're looking for a good sushi place !
asian	the food is the best thai food we have ever had . we aren 't experts but know a good meal when we have one and this place definitely lived up to its reputation .
asian	drove there on 5.30.2016 . it 's dark and sad inside and almost looks like the place has been taken apart . come back tokyo ! ! !
asian	came there in late lunch times but still packed . ordered a pho and two menus starting with ban . the flavor of the soup was very deep and had a lot of meat inside . the soup wasn 't the taste that i had when i stayed in vietnam tbh but still very good . ban 's i ordered 27 and 31 . bbq was the best dish that i had in the past whole month . all reasonable price .
asian	come here all the time with my family , order takeout for parties and even get get catering for larger events . everyone loves it , and is always satisfied . the sushi is fresh , cheap , and comes in generous portions . its great to always be welcomed with hot miso soup and finish your meal with some delicious cold ice cream . come hungry and you won 't be disappointed , come less hungry and you 'll take home your lunch for the next day .
asian	i love it its so cute and convenient .. the lady here is super nice ! i defiantly recommend this place !
asian	it 's open a bit later than other places in oakville therefore it 's great for the night owl crowd . i 've been there at least 3 times and there is usually some party going on . later in the evening they play music and have the most interesting japanese anime or sumo wrestling on a big screen . the food is authentic and high quality . their rolls are amazing . but what makes this restaurant such a hit is the personal staff and bartenders who make everyone feel like a regular . they greet everyone in japanese . i 'll be back !
asian	fast and great quality for your money . gone for lunch many times and i am so n and out within 30 min full .......
asian	try to arrive close to opening hours so you don 't wait in line too much . went there a couple of times with friends and never was unsatisfied ! they also had a contest on their instagram page to win a free meal which i think is fun . a place to go ! highly recommend !
asian	food is great ! although i went for a quick takeout order , the staff was extremely friendly i had to write a review ! will most certainly visit again !
asian	hv been coming here for almost an year now and never been disappointed . they also brought their sweet chilli sauce back ! ! !
asian	braised beef is my fav but chicken is good as well .
asian	we went there during lunch time after our visit to mentor mall since it 's only few minutes away . i didn 't know what to expect before walking in here . staff was friendly and explained us how it works over there . food was prepared promptly . great selection of sauces !
asian	it 's new and was pleasantly surprised. the staff did well accommodating us to make sure we knew what we were doing when cooking our own meat. mizzo and blake were very helpful and will for sure be back .
asian	everything is fresh , great service , and fun experience . will definitely be coming back .
asian	highly recommended . their signature dish , thai basil , is amazing ! even though it might seem busy at lunch , the kitchen is super quick and the food comes fast and tables turn quickly . i would not worry if it looks busy , service will be speedy . recommended highly when needing quick lunch downtown .
asian	no other place can give you a bargain for sushi boats with tempura and edamame included into it . the tempura is delicious here and nothing like anywhere else . the sushi rolls were also so unique and delicious in its own ways . my favourite was definitely the beef aburi sushi . if you 're there you have to try it . they also have amazing daily deals for their customers so if you love sushi , kibo is the perfect a la carte joint for you !
asian	food is great , and surprisingly very cheap ( compared to la ) , for example seaweed salad is only 5.95 . even simple spinach salad delicious dressings so it tastes amazing . veggies with vegan chicken was great as well . so we even took some salads to go . will be back for sure ! try their poti with curry ! ! ! ! ! ! ! insanely good
asian	the 40 piece small sushi boat is $ 45 and included a lot of sushi from different types of fish . the maki was well made with less rice than you 'd usually find at this price and a lot more fish . all the sashimi used was very fresh , did not have the usual watery texture that cheaper sushi does . the service was very attentive and friendly , the restaurant is decorated with paper cranes and ambient lighting . we were super impressed and would definitely recommend !
asian	found it while searching on yelp and went after work with a friend . everything we had was so delicious ! the venue is so cute . has a great outdoor area that would be perfect for a big group . the staff was so nice . i am beyond excited to have found a thai place i like and i will be going here again and again .
asian	the stuff are very professional , they don 't smile a lot but the service is exceptional , dishes kept on coming as we kept on ordering . the octopus sashimi is one the best i ever ate . salt and pepper shrimps ; gigantic . maki are full of flavour to let you tasting buds ask for more . by far the best all you can eat sushi in the region . highly recommend it . i give it 5 stars in its category . 4 stars among the highly rated sushi places . real note would be 4.5 stars .
asian	they bent over backwards to accommodate my celiac disease gluten intolerance . the owner / chef personally went through what items she could make gluten free ! thank you ! : - ) highly recommend
asian	papaya salad is so refreshing and full of flavor . combination pad thai with pork beef and shrimp is enough for two meals . thai toasts for an appetizer consists if minced chicken and shrimp baked on toast served with cucumber salad . it us a must try ! !
asian	got the beef and veggie combo and it was mouth watering ! deni was our server and he was very attentive !
asian	melinda always takes care of me and offers great customer service ! even the fried rice is exceptional here ! : )
asian	definitely try if you 're near that area . their spicy eggplant is awesome ! ! best i 've ever had and their soups are delicious .
asian	great food , very natural and authentic . interior is beautiful , the owner spent 2 months decorating himself ! the food presentation was nice as well . i was surprised at how empty it was , we were the only ones eating . will absolutely come back . newest favorite thai spot !
asian	i ordered mine medium spicy ( 7 out of 10 ) and didn 't fit it very spicy at all so i would suggest ordering up a spice level from what you are used to at other indian restaurants .
asian	great green curry and their desserts are unreal . highly suggest the green tea crème brûlée .
asian	the shrimp egg foo young , shrimp fried rice , general tso chicken , sweet and sour chicken , pepper steak and egg rolls are to die for . i 've been going to this place for 30 + years ... the only chinese restaurant i will ever go to in ohio . a +
asian	great service and great food . i am so happy that you guys open this location . i tried miso mild . it was spicy enough but has a flavor . i usually don 't like spicy food but i like this spicy . it was just right for me . they also making own noodle ! ! i will definitely come back again .
asian	i got the surprise me roll and it was really good , was very pleasantly surprised . i asked for soy paper and they said it won 't be an issue at all . wife had the chicken and shrimp noodles and it was really good . will definitely come again .
asian	great vibe and the food is exceptional ! we had the avocado / coleslaw salad which was incredible and flavourful . in addition , we had the loosey and the fried rice . it was all so good and filling . the service was friendly and attentive ! prices were great and so reasonable . we will come back again and recommend to others ! ! ! thank you ! ! ! ! !
asian	had a beef casserole dish with vegetables . flavors nicely infused into all elements of the casserole . side dishes were amazing as well . service rather decent . space in which to eat was airy , fairly wide open . impressive stuff all around !
asian	highly recommended . food was fantastic and service was even better . very accommodating and pricing was reasonable . especially , on half night pasta night : ) support this family run business . they deserve it ! ! : )
asian	i came here for my late night bday dinner and loved it ! great customer service , good environment , delicious rolls ; tiger roll was sooo good . the waitress , kini , was very friendly and very attentive . she recommended the honey bread and it 's a must for dessert ! i came from la and i 'm a sushi lover . sushi way is one of the best !
asian	i 'd been here before but trying their food at devoured reminded me that i needed to come back again soon . we brought our own beer and let them choose our dishes . my favorite was a monkfish pate ' with a quail egg on a slice of lemon . what a creative and delicious presentation !
asian	i decided to forego my usual trip to yardhouse and have a bite here . the calamari is really good ( if not much , but lots of flavor ) . i ordered the miyagi-san , which was just bursting with taste . i will say that they put maybe a tad bit too much sauce , and the menu doesn 't really do a great job of explaining what the size of the burgers are , so i ended up with the miyagi-san , which is the size of a f 'ing brick . otherwise , you can 't really beat the price and taste at this level .
asian	if i 'm in need for a nice hot soup i come here . i ordered the special combo , and the pho here is soooooo good . the service is very friendly too . they 're nice and patient . i would definitely come here again . i left the restaurant satisfied .
asian	lot of options for vegetarians and i would highly recommend wok fried cottage cheese . one of the best ! : - )
asian	i have only been here once and only went inside to pick up my food but the service is great and the staff is quite nice . did not have to wait long for my food and i like that i can pick out how many soy sauce packets i can get instead of them giving them to me from behind the counter . i have only had the chicken teryaki with vegetables and it is amazing every time . the chicken portion could be bigger but it is worth it .
asian	i have ordered anything on their menu and everything is delicious ! my favourite thing from them is hokein me noodles ! good price and they give you a lot ! my husband and i share one dish and it fills us both . he is a big guy so he eats a lot . i definitely will recommend this place .
asian	i loved every roll i ate . great service , as this was the first time being here .... he asked what things we liked and didnt like and brought us things he thought we would like to try ... we got the all you can eat . this place makes me like sushi more !
asian	i love when they have music . great staff ! their pad thai is slammin and the penang curry is heaven !
asian	i really enjoy the ambiance of the place- good music , good lighting , and clean . was seated and served very quickly . food came out fast and was delicious . i got the pepper garlic chicken and the flavors were mouthwatering .
asian	the owners are the most friendly couple and honestly it 's one of the things i miss the most about being in toronto !
asian	fantastic food , reasonable price , and great service .
asian	amazing place .... i 've eaten at bejing noodle bar 9 at caesars a bunch ... smaller menu here but the food is so good and made fresh to order ... great find ... great restaurant ... i will be back
asian	i found that the salad portion was pretty big for the price ( around 10 $ each ) . i had the cucumber pickle salad which exceeded my expectations . the ingredients were fresh and the dressing was delicious . perfect for a quick lunch or takeout .
asian	located in chinatown , this is an affordable and enjoyable experience . if you haven 't tried shabu shabu before , you don 't know what you 're missing . the variety will mean everyone is pleased and you will leave happy and full . the lunch and dinner combos are flexible and customizable.please give it a try . the staff will guide you through your first shabu shabu experience .
asian	my favourite izakaya in toronto . dishes are always great quality . good portions . nice clean cute place . service is great and friendly staff . when you walk in , you see dorameon playing by the bar area . overall good dining experience with great food !
asian	my soup , beef satay and chicken pad tai were outstanding . do whatever it takes to eat here the next time you 're here in vegas .
asian	nick really took care of us ! awesome place . we will never go anywhere else for sushi again . the happy hour deals are the best . my two favorite rolls " lisa lisa " and " king cobra " deep fried are heaven !
asian	pineapple soju is out of this world . got # 37 , # 36 and # 6 . great prices . must visit !
asian	paul ( the manager ) and the other guy named johanson were great people ... johanson kinda looked like a mini paul but regardless both guys were amazing and the place is clean and options to a seafood lover are endless . will always come back .
asian	quick great tasting food ! easy yummy and affordable ! thumbs up ! ! ! get the hawaiian poke and the wings are a must try ! everything is delicious .

asian	the environment is relaxed and nice . the food is delicious . we had lobster with all the spices . btw the mild is not that mild ! but it was still very tasty . 10 / 10
asian	amazing place .... the first place i liked that actually serves indochinese food ... their schezwan chicken and burnt garlic fried rice are remarkable .. also , they are quick with service and quantity of food is worth what you pay for ... all in all great place !
asian	if you like food with flavor then come to red rice . must have coconut titiya . everything is freshly made to order and that is what makes the difference . i will for sure come again .

asian	the good was delicious and the man working at the front was so helpful and courteous . they give you a good amount of food and they deliver , will definitely return multiple times !
asian	if you are going for a hibachi show go there . if you want amazing sushi come to sakura !
asian	the restaurant is open and spacious , and the personal hot pots makes the dining experience hassle free and enjoyable . the revolving food bar was also very new and interesting , and makes it easy and quick to get our food . presentation of the food was also beautiful--from vegetable picnic baskets to plates in the shape of shells , the chefs know how to attract foodies . our server matthew was super helpful , and explained to us how to get started with the experience . the food itself was superb , and i would definitely come back again !
asian	the staff are so friendly and quick to refill whatever you need . the experience is very unique and authentic . much more than the grill houses downtown . although it is not all you can eat , the price is extremely reasonable and the side dishes are amazing ! highly recommend ! ! !
asian	the sushi is all high quality and delicious . the presentation of the food is all beautiful . they forget to bring us our sashimi because they had a wedding reception going on , but that made that up to us by giving us 2 free ice-creams . although pricey , you definitely pay for what you 're getting .
asian	the waiter and owner were very attentive and nice . i ordered the tonkotsu ramen and the noodles were great and the meat was excellent and perfectly cooked . they even ended up giving me a extra free bowl of ramen after i was done chatting with them . by far one of my favorite places and good priced .
asian	they have karaoke friday and saturday night and it 's not too loud . our baby slept through it . we had so much fun , we 'll definitely go back again . caution ... their food is spicy ! ! ! i orddera a number 3 hot and it was hard to eat ... 2nd time i got a 1 and it was perfect . and i normally can do hot !
asian	they opened last year and we 've been going there regularly for lunch ever since . the owner 's korean and it is definitely authentic korean food . everything on the regular menu is just super yummy but beware , the lunch " box " is not at all authentic korean and it 's actually pretty bad compared to the rest of the amazing menu but i guess it works for some people as most of my colleages get it when we go there . service is great but it can be a bit slow . decor is nice and the whole place is completely renovated .
asian	the atmosphere is welcoming and serene . they entail a private room for intimate group parties as well as a back room for larger parties . the food is absolutely delicious and very apparent on its traditional preparations . something different in the vegas area that i believe many have been wanting but did not know . this is definitely a try before you die place ! !
asian	i love the atmosphere and design inside , service was fast , and the dishes were delicious . great curry , spring rolls , and the best fish dishes . be sure to ask for the fish dish with the entire , untouched fish . it might be a hassle to peel the scales and pick the bones out , but it was excellent . one of the best dishes i 've had while living in madison .
asian	loved it ! i went for lunch today with my husband and 9 year old son . it was my sons first time at a hibachi grill , and he had the best time . he asked to go back before they even brought the bill . the chef ( a gentlemen named ritchie ) was wonderful ! ! ! ! he even came back out to talk to my son after the meal to make sure he had a good time . i will definitely be going back again and again ! thank you very much for making my sons 4th of july even better !
asian	i will be back . if you go here try the sea bass .
asian	love coming here for the lunch special which is every week day from 11-3 . which includes miso soup , salad and 2 rolls of sushi or a lunch plate for about $ 10 per person . my fave sushi rolls to get here would have to be the mark 's roll which comes w / shrimp tempura , cream cheese , and avocado . it tastes very fresh and tasty . also the chicken teriyaki is very good which comes with a bowl of white rice . they also sell bento boxes too if you want a combination of diff food . the prices are affordable as well . try this place out for some good sushi !
asian	the food is great and really good price . the service is excellent , super helpful and friendly . we love it
asian	very friendly service . i now come to this place oftenly .
asian	now i don 't have to drive to markham to get hakka food . the staff are super friendly . the place is clean .
asian	now i don 't have to drive to markham to get hakka food . the staff are super friendly . the place is clean .
asian	was recommended by a friend to try and i was satisfied . the price was great . not too far from chinatown . they had many varieties of meat and kimchi to choose from . i definitely will be back ! ! !
asian	everything is reasonable price and you get great quality food . byob saves you a ton . sit outside in the summer you won 't be disappointed .
asian	awesome service , nice scenery , authentic japanese food , and not bad prices like the $ 22 meal that includes about 3 rolls , teriyaki chicken / salmon / salted salmon / or etc. and rice and dessert including much more ! i will most definitely come back again and again !
asian	super cute place to go to with friends and family . i enjoy how they play korean tv shows on the tvs and play kpop in the background . if you 're ever in the mood for bowls this is the place to go to .
asian	great for both small and large groups . bubble tea is very good but a little bit pricey . food is good as well . service can be mediocre sometimes but the wait time us usually reasonable and ambience is great
asian	nice food , great quantity and i loved the ambience a lot .
asian	great customer service and the food is delicious . always have the steam chicken potstickers for the appetizer , for the main platter pork chowmein noodles definitely recommend it !
asian	jayden is a great host and the music selection is phenomenal ! we had a fantastic time and we highly recommend it !
asian	it 's authentically korean , ran by koreans , served by koreans , visited by koreans . they have $ 15 all you can eat kbbq which is nothing like the chinese imitated ones . to u get to choose two items of the four ( eg . pork belly , beef , pork neck , bulgogi ) . they give you so many side dishes it 's amazing oh and refillable . they have soju , import and domestic beer , some plum soju or sake too . i don 't think they carry cass beer anymore or they 're always out . gotta check them out and pat mart is right across the street too .
asian	lots of fun . went here for a surprise party . good food and clean place .
asian	always good service and the sushi is great ! good thing we live so close .
asian	amazing food , great service . they serve sushi as well as pan asian cuisine . i tried the singapore noodle curry today and was not disappointed ! i will definitely go back here !
asian	very clean and great service . bring your appetite ! definitely worth the trip !
asian	very friendly staff and very good food ... especially the wagyu beef skewers . tables are a little bit cramped but i chalk that up to the whole authentic japanese experience . definitely recommend if you 're looking for a unique dining experience
asian	i love the style of food , the atmosphere , and the service . they are very quick and prompt , our appetizers came out in a matter of minutes ( 4 or 5 tops ) , and the meals came out perfectly after we got done with the opening dish . the only downside to this place i can think of is the selection , while all the meals are very good , the diversity is a little on the low side .
asian	very hawaii like . poke bowl was very fresh it reminded me of the poke bowls that i was getting from foodland in mililani hawaii . i will definitely come back each time the other awesome thing is that they ask you if your military or prior service and you get a discount not something that they should do but i believe that you caring for service members is always a big plus . thank you guys for awesome good poke .
asian	we go here once a week . huge menu . great prices . the staff is very friendly . we are constantly taking new people with us . this is by far our favorite sushi restaurant in charlotte .
asian	we 've been looking for a wonderful sushi place and we 've found it . the service was great , clean , and of course the most important part ... the food was delicious .
asian	thanks to samantha for the best waitress service ever ! her recommendations for vegan dishes were amazing .. i had the instant veggie noodles full of mushrooms , and then amazing coconut milk coffee ! ! ! went there twice yesterday ! ! highly recommended. big portions and affordable prices , super clean place !
asian	really quality beef here . the seasoned boneless short rib ( important note : cooked by jackson ) is the best bbq beef i 've ever had in my life so far ! will defiantly come back with friends and parents .
asian	craving dukbokki or korean friend chicken ? they have it to go ! the pieces are cheaper than h mart up the street and the layout is more favourable . will go here from now on for my asian treats ! btw the galleria brand kimchi is very delicious and fresh with no msg . so happy that it is now in downtown toronto . about time !
asian	i 've never had a hot pot before but as a lover of pho i had to try this place ! the veggies are fresh and the broth was on point ! i 'll definitely be back ! ! ! happy i found this place to eat at while working in madison ! if you 're even thinking about this place as an option just try it you 'll thank me !
asian	the restaurant owner has recently changed . the owner made the food fresh as soon as we ordered . affordable food and great quantity . every item i have tried has been amazing . if in the area , check it out ! i definitely recommend this !
asian	truly a great place to try some real chinese food .
asian	easily one of the most authentic japanese cuisine places i 've been in northeast ohio , i plan to return many of times in the future .
asian	the service is pretty good . if you 're looking for a great soup then don 't look any further
asian	service is not the greatest but cant expect too much for a busy and cheap place .
asian	presentation is 10 star and customer service is impeccable . also music is very pleasant and relaxing
asian	you make your own bowl , then add your own sauce . you can put as much food as you want into your bowl . very well done .
asian	i don 't quite have the experience that my girlfriend does when it comes to pho ( she grew up back east ) , but this place has the best pho that i have tasted . i took my girlfriend here to try it out because i saw the reviews here on yelp and i am glad that i did . the food we had was amazing and we will definitely be going back for more . if you are in the mood for great vietnamese food , khai hoan is the place to go .
asian	my flight was delayed at billy bishop airport so i went to the closest restaurant . i didn 't wanna stuff myself so i got the spicy tuna sashimi . . it was so fresh and delicious i got the spicy salmon sashimi right after . i also ordered their sweet potatoe noodles which so good . also their green salad was a step above normal ones . it had apple and avacado . i 'll be back for sure and bring friends . not happy my flight was delayed but very happy i found this place
asian	please come check this place out . you need this in your life ! ordered the kentucky fried fish bowl . i 'd eat this fish over the best fried chicken any day . fried pork belly bowl ? ! are you kidding me ? it 's great ! open for lunch until 6pm . can 't wait to try the thai shrimp bayou bowl and the pho-king egg next time !
asian	we had the wasabi and avocado poke with rice and fried noodles on the side . fresh and so flavorful . a go to if you 're in the henderson area .
asian	the staff was so friendly ! ! ! ! i would honestly recommend this place ! being in arizona it 's hard to find fresh seafood , the fish was melt in your mouth and no stench !
asian	love how you can custom create your bowl to your liking . it 's great how the staff makes recommendations and suggestions if it 's your first time .
asian	i really like the dragon bowl . i 've been here a few times and everyone is extremely friendly . so glad we have this in centennial hills .
asian	the fish is super fresh and the bowls are beautifully made . love that they offer options other than tuna . will definitely order again .
asian	had the spicy avocado and the garlic ahi poke ! reminded me so much of the poke we would get in hawaii ! she even let us sample some so we could figure out what we wanted . price is spot on . we did the two pokes with rice , got a thing of soybeans , and 3 drinks and it came out to $ 21 ! can 't beat that ! can 't wait to go back ! well worth the 6 hour drive from slc .
asian	makes me miss hawaii . great selection . very fresh . casual ambiance and super reasonable .
asian	portions and selections are plentiful and the taste is outstanding ! there 's another one in the neighborhood ( ahi poke ) that is truly missing the mark next to this place . the owners are delightful , too . i can 't say enough good things ... did i mention the ingredients are fresh ? ! take a look at the " hidden " reviews too - they 're all positive , and i have no idea why they 're not automatically visible . my new favorite neighborhood spot , and if it wasn 't close , i 'd happily drive the distance !
asian	the noodles are a lovely , chewy nest , but it 's the broth that is the star of this bowl . pair it up with a pork bun and you can die happy !
asian	pork was perfectly tender . ribs had just right amount of chew . you get to choose from several different sauces , many with a mango or peach base . bit tough to get in but service was quick and friendly . food came out fast and we were never thirsty .
asian	portions are amazing . food is amazing . good price . great service . my friend forgot her purse , we called them , they said they have it in a safe place . real sweet . definitely coming back .
asian	possibly the best sushi restaurant that i 've ever been to ! be sure to try the protein roll . it 's $ 30 but when you taste it you 'll be blown away . we started with edamame like we always do and were so pleasantly surprised to discover a new twist on edamame : they do a version that is a sugar chili paste . sounds weird but it 's soooo good ! we had many dishes and everything was absolutely perfect . this is how fine dining should be .
asian	possibly the best thai food i 've had , ever ! the papaya salad was spicy but good and the pad see ew and panang curry were both delicious ! also a great deal ! but the best part was the owner who served us . she was so sweet and made us feel like we were being served by our own auntie . i 'm glad we purchased property in vegas because i plan to keep coming back to this place again and again .
asian	i was so happy to find this little gem so close to home . love the food and the people are so sweet
asian	amazing preparation , acute attention to detail , and the best sushi i 've ever had combined to make a truly amazing dinner experience
asian	great sushi in scottsdale . the chef came out multiple times to make sure we were taken care of .
asian	one of my new favourites ! i like to think you can judge a sushi bar by its chirashi and the chirashi here was definitely not a disappointment . highly recommended .
asian	will definitely add this to our local favorites ! try the catfish and crispy duck ...... not to mention their shrimp pad thai .
asian	only thing they could improve on would maybe the they 're decorations inside the restaurant .
asian	location by far cleanest and nicest of all places i 've been on spring mountain . must try !
asian	food is delicious , both raw and cooked varieties . my friends and i have reordered the short ribs many many times . the one con is that the rice tastes underseasoned . service is very polite : )
asian	the only thing is when they are busy the service can be a little slow ! over all one of my favorite sushi in richmond hill ! love their bento special they are all between 10.95-12.95 ! each of these bento specials come with either a crispy or spicy salmon hand roll , miso soup , salad and ice cream ! their sashimi are always fresh because they are a small restaurant and hav high turn overs . my fav is their salmon bento !
asian	we particularly love the bbq garlic flavour and wedges . that with the sauce and very reasonable prices keeps us coming back
asian	i ordered the volcano ramen as is and it was really tasty . so much food for such a low price ! the food is super tasty and the prices can 't be beat . i stopped by here on a tuesday night and it was still bustling . i can imagine that it gets very crowded on the weekend . they accept credit cards ( not amex ) and there 's an atm if you need to grab cash . this place is located at the far end of chinatown and up a staircase lined with christmas lights . i highly recommend if you like ramen and are in the area !
asian	will always stop by when visiting in the area ! love the pork belly / red bean waffles / and kim mari . good stuff it 's $ 3 for 3 waffles and $ 1.25 each $ 2.25 for the pork belly
asian	quick fast and easy service . i ordered the house chicken on fried rice and i was happily surprised at how large their portions are . the food tastes amazing and i 'll definitely be coming back for more . i encourage all to give this new spot a shot !
asian	the interior is absolutely adorable -keeping it old fashioned south korea . friendly service and definitely a place to return to , parking may be tricky ! !
asian	i like the set up of the restaurant too ! possibly my favourite restaurant in the parkdale area . i had the vegetarian lunch special . the portion size was quite big , and it wasn 't oily at all like how some other restaurants prepare it .
asian	pricey but worth it ! ! shrimp plate was delicious their cocktail sauce a bit spicy but nummy also enjoyed their fried shrooms for the price it was pretty small size / : only thing i might say is they charge for refills / : ! ! and cash only / : ! !
asian	great service . order the food with at least mild spice , or else you may find the dishes a little bland . our whole table agreed on that .
asian	pros : fresh food and amazing prices . i have to say the first time here it was pretty fun . good vibes and and for sure a cool family environment . as a asian haha the seafood was bomb con : only reason i am not getting a 5 star is because the wait & they forgot about us . lol they didn 't get us spoons or good services . i think it 's because they were busy but besides that it was fun .
asian	very friendly family feel inside . the soft shell crab is awesome ! ! sweet rice with mango dessert too . you will be addicted .
asian	definitely recommend this spot to friends , and i will be coming back next time i 'm in town .
asian	they don 't drown the sushi in nasty sweet salty syrupy sauces like most sushi places these days . i love how they let the natural flavors shine . my favorites are the wagyu sear it yourself , nana iro , and tuna with watermelon . the service is great , very attentive . definitely comparable to the other high end sushi places like nobu .
asian	first time i 've had yemeni food , and it did not disappoint . don 't let the looks from the outside keep you away !
asian	some of the dishes tastes like the way my mom made them for my brother and i when we were kids . brought back so many great memories . the service here is terrific . very friendly and unexpected in chinatown . i work at a hotel and when the guests want good chinese food , i send them here . this is the authentic stuff right here ! !
asian	there 's a 20 item order limit ( order more as you eat or split into 2 orders ) and 1 slice of each sashimi per order only . still beats most other ayce places in terms of quality and selection and i was definitely able to " eat back " my money 's worth for the slightly pricier bill .
asian	great servers , very respectful , and the sushi cooks are great at what they do . it may seem small on the outside , but the heart is what counts . definitely worth a try if anything else .
asian	amazing quality of food , pleasant environment , and amazing customer service planning to come back next week
asian	my boyfriend and i went here tonight and got a few rolls . we got the las vegas , shrimp tempura , dragon , baked lobster , and phoenix roll . they were delicious ! the baked lobster is expensive , but so worth it ! we will definitely be back .
asian	this isn 't a restaurant , you can eat there if there 's space but it 's better to take it to go . it 's a small fishmonger with some other japanese products . it 's too bad it 's out of the way or i would go there more often .
asian	best quality japanese restaurant in brampton . nice thick cuts of fish . well worth the visit when in brampton .
asian	amazing quantity and quality. and they give 3 leaves of culantro with the pho , love it .
asian	authentic hakka cuisine . been going there for a hakka fix since 2005 and haven 't had a single bad experience . owners are a husband and wife team that excel in cuisine and service . be prepared to wait for a table if you visit on a weekend . the place is generally packed in the evening .
asian	they do not accept reservations so you have to get here during off peak hours or get your name on the list to wait ! make sure you have someone present to stand and wait because we walked away while they called our names : ( . theres also not a lot of space in the restaurant which gives reason to the long wait times . i would try any of the ramen bowls they have available . they are all delicious and authentic !
asian	so glad they finally opened a ramen house near where we live . anyone that loves ramen like us needs to come here and enjoy the friendly atmosphere and good food .
asian	the restaurant is nice and clean and the servers and friendly and polite . i wish they would turn up the air conditioning ! ! ! ! yikes
asian	andrew and andrea are two amazing , friendly , and helpful servers . would go again and recommend to anyone looking for bomb ramen . 11 out of 10 !
asian	and the prices are very affordable too . the place is very clean , truly japanese .
asian	by far the best in the city . get the appetizer that comes in a bowl , it is so eclectic and flavourful you could actually have one or two as the main meal ! beware coming on a friday or saturday night ! you will wait for over an hour at peak times for a tiny , back support-less table , so this is a good daytime or weeknight place to take someone . especially good for tourists or a local trying to impress a date or visitor ; ) .
asian	good service . a little awkward with the christian music . not order and appetizer the ramen is so filling . spicy broth is a mild spicy , easy to eat . pork dumplings amazing .
asian	good sushi and side dishes also . this place is not the most inviting , but they definitely make up for their lackluster decor with damn good food . you will not find a line here like monta , which is very surprising . highly recommend .
asian	great customer service ... we bring out 2 1 / 2 year old toddler all the time , they are accommodating and friendly - always remembering to bring her a small bowl and plastic spoon ! food is awesome ! best fried rice and ramen in town !
asian	their fried rice is great and got to have the garlic edamame . its a small place , but so far has never been too busy . service is great .
asian	i always come back here for the chicken ramen and my fiancé always gets the pork ramen with extra pork . staff and service are great !
asian	i always get the miso , last time we also got their fried chicken which was soooo good . definitely getting that again . the restaurant is pretty small , but cozy . i think they make their noodles from scratch , but i don 't know if i 'm remembering wrong . the serving sizes are perfect , and i really love how close it is to me ! it 's not as good as umami that was on mill ave ( now gone ; - ; ) but still pretty nice . there 's also another ramen place right across the street , but i wouldn 't even bother if i were you .
asian	i had the volcano pork , top notch . even the regular size is huge . we love this place , best ramen in montreal , only problem is parking is a bit of a pain in the area but hardly their fault ( chinatown ) . go here
asian	i loved their spicy miso and the broth was souper amazing with their bone broth that has been cooked for days ! thank goodness i did not have to wait in line for a long time and i really felt like i was eating in japan ! staff was friendly and quick service !
asian	me and my friends keep on going back to this place and we don 't mind the huge line up , because it is worth the wait - even during winter time ! i even brought my mom here once , and she was so impressed . the price is okay ; servers are friendly ; good ambience - definitely feels like your in a ramen place ; and worth-the-wait ramen . hopefully , the owner would expand the place to accomodate more people
asian	my friend and i love ramen and couldn 't stop talking about how delicious it was . we got the shoyu ramen with the black garlic oil which was a very nice addition ; it added an extra layer of flavor . the noodles are homemade which is nice . we both agreed it is the best ramen we 've had in vegas ! i can 't wait to go back !
asian	loved the spicy ramen and the fried chicken thigh appetizer . very satisfying . quite inexpensive too .
asian	it is a great atmosphere the workers greet you when you come and when you leave . staff is very attentive even when it got busy around 9 on a thursday . in town on business and will stop i 'm again . the ramen is great taste and filling . also be sure to get a few sake sours bartend was very busy but still managed to get me drinks in great time .
asian	write your name and guest count when you arrive and they will get you a seat , food comes fast , hot and delicious , servers are super quick , bill came before we even asked !
asian	so good you 'll pick your bowl up and drink all the soup ! ! ! i 've had the pork belly ramen and spicy ramen-both equally amazing . i liked sitting at the bar better than the weird stools with no backs . our service was excellent and it was fun to watch the open kitchen cook
asian	the broth is tasty , noodles are homemade , and portion is good sized . i had the ultra spicy ramen and my husband had the spicy ramen- ultra spicy had a nice kick to it ! so happy another ramen shop opened up . we will be returning !
asian	the broth was just an umame explosion . buttery , porky , hints of sesame oil . the egg was perfect . the pork was perfect . the ramen itself was only ok but the broth is what the dish is all about .
asian	the broth was perfect and the noodles had just the right amount of chew . i liked that you could chose thicker or thinner noodles . if you want garlic , they bring it to your table and you use a garlic press to squeeze in just the right amount . we also tried the cauliflower and green beans . a smaller portion than expected for the price , but each very tasty ! can 't wait to go back !
asian	the vegetarian broth is delicious . it 's a very busy place yet the service is quick . definitely a repeat customer !
asian	the ambience is good for a date or even a group hang , the costumer service is great and the owner is awesome . overall this has become my favorite ramen place , hands down !
asian	tried three different options with my family and they were all incredible . staff was very kind and helpful . meals came out quickly . highly recommend !
asian	ramen was spicy and delicious ! a must try . i totally recommend the california crunchy roll . fresh flavors and reasonably priced . will tell every sushi lover i know
asian	small place . had black garlic , was great . traditional tea . good price .
asian	amazing lunch specials , good deals , and cheap food . went there with my friends , there was 5 of us . ordered wings , pad thai , and crispy noodles and fed everyone for only $ 40 . friendly server , and cook . they also do take out and delivery for those late nights . definitely would recommend this to anyone who loves real authentic thai food .
asian	amazing real chinese food ... homade noodles ... and buns ... more people need to come here
asian	really amazing ! the man there took the time to talk about hue and bun hue the soup with us . it was a nice experience for what was just a quick lunch . the bun hue soup was spectacular . i always dump hoisin and sriracha in pho but this didn 't need anything .
asian	really enjoyed the service and most of all the food ! they had sweet little extras for valentines that made our experience exceptional .
asian	really good food , large portions , great prices .. i love thai food , and this is the best in vegas i have tried so far . must go here ..
asian	if your in vegas this place is a hidden gem . best lunch specials and lovely service . everything is fresh .
asian	really satisfied , the lunch special was fantastic , i can 't wait to come back here for dinner ! best $ 10 lunch you could have in newmarket , trust me ! !
asian	the salmon carpacci roll with truffle oil was incredible - among many others . thank you ! !
asian	nice thick consistency and they always make it super spicy ( just how i like it ) ! the tofu is also incredible . well cooked , not soggy and very well seasoned .
asian	dim sum are awesome , always fresh when i come here but this time just the eggplant was a little on the rough side , other than that this is a decently nice place to go solo or with whoevers .
asian	a bit on the small side , but the sushi chef ( s ) are japanese and know what they 're doing . the staff is friendly but service was a little slow . the sushi taste amazing and very fresh . on opening , they were already full and we agreed to wait 45-1 hour to be seated . the actual location of the restaurant is questionable , i wish it wasn 't in a bit of a run down area .
asian	all you can eat lunch special is the best deal in town . i recommend the mushroom poppers and the california crunch roll
asian	always great service and awesome food . the blue fin toro tartare is quite delicious . huge selection of sake . one of the best restaurants in charlotte .
asian	great atmosphere ! highly recommend the salt and pepper shrimp and honey toast ! the mj is amazing too !
asian	cleanliness is beyond reproach ! what you really want to know about is the food .... yeah , it 's really , really good food ! i had the bun ( egg roll and pork ) it was quite tasty ! i highly recommend this as well as the phò ! oh and if you like coffee , you simply must try the cafe suda ! they have a great tasting coffee which doesn 't leave a bitter aftertaste ! thank goodness ! my whole family can 't wait to go back !
asian	everyone is very nice and helpful ! my friends can 't stop talking about this great korean bbq place in las vegas . so we went everywhere till we found the place and " super worth the wait ... " nice to treat your whole family .
asian	this is one of those hole-in-the-wall gems in toronto that you must try especially if you 're vegetarian and loves chinese food . they have a variety of dishes ranging from hot and sour soup to curry marinated " chicken " to mock " duck . " i would highly recommend getting the chicken in iron plate . it 's one of the most flavourful mock meat i 've ever had ! not to mention their portion is huge ! ! they also have some mock meat in a freezer that you could buy to take home as well .
asian	for $ 90 , we ate until we were stuffed . everything was sooooo fresh and artistically prepared and of the highest quality . in my opinion , just as good if not better than kabuto . my only concern is that there was only 1 other diner in the 2 + hours that we were there . so go and dine at this restaurant before it goes away !
asian	loved the crispy rice spicy tuna and the baked lobster roll . sushi chef was great and service was good .
asian	i went here with my husband for our anniversary and we had an amazing time . the place is romantic and quaint . staff were very polite , knowledgable and quick . and most of all the food was epic ! we had the soft shell crab , inspire burger and ceviche . love all the creativity i.e. colours , textures and flavours put in our dishes . the presentation was very artistic and beautiful . would highly recommend to anyone ! ! f
asian	lets start off by saying really goood waiter . portions were big and very tasty aswell . will definitely be coming back
asian	ordered chirashi bowl and gyoza , very fresh and delicious . unfortunately don 't live in the area , otherwise would 've definitely become a regular with such an extensive menu and great service .
asian	love this place and eat here twice a week religiously . red curry and panang are sooooo good !
asian	one of my favorite for appearance , food , friendliness and manners in all of the las vegas valley . the all you can eat is outstanding ; i highly recommend tako , sake and ebie raw sushi and shrimp and veggie tempura . follow by berry vanilla ice cream parfait . this is always wonderful and i am happy when i can eat here often ! !
asian	they also have some of the best house fried rice i have ever had ! they cater to vegetarians and meat eaters alike and they deliver ! love this place ! !
asian	stop in for a quick and excellent meal . rou jia mo are very close to authentic . tacos are amazing . desserts are indescribably delicious . what more to say ? for a lunch without cocktails / drinks , you will spend as much as you would at the wicked spoon ( best in vegas all-you-can-eat buffet around the corner in the cosmopolitan ) , but your experience will be better . they do take-out as well !
asian	such great food . the barbecue buns , enoki mushroom balls , tom yang fried rice , hot and sour soup , are all delicious . great service too !
asian	prices are reasonable ~ 11-12 per dish and very filling and flavourful . i got the tofu dish and the corn soup , both are delicious and would highly recommend ! it 's cash only though so make sure you bring enough cash ! they also have vegan baked goods ! !
asian	the food is awesome , but its the service that puts this place over the top . it 's family operated so you know they care about each and every customer . i will not go to any other thai restaurant in az , la 's is my absolute favorite .
asian	the staff was incredibly helpful and the food was delicious ! the atmosphere was super relaxing and inviting as well . the restaurant is set up very cute and calming . i would definitely go to this place again and recommend this to anyone .
asian	all of the dishes look and taste great . the staff is extremely pleasant and courteous and the owner is always around making sure your meal is fantastic .
asian	very clean , and well appointed . the menu was impressive and varied . service was excellent all three times i dined there . portions were huge and each dish i had was delicious . the sesame balls , the chicken feet , the dumpling with shrimp and peatip were all my favorites .
asian	we had dinner reservations for ten and even though we were delayed for 45 minutes , they held our dinner table on a friday night . food was absolutely delicious n well worth the ' all you can eat ' price . everyone agreed this will be our monthly friday sushi night . only draw back was having to share the sushi ' all you can eat ' form . otherwise , great place , great food and great staff .
asian	i am vegetarian and really appreciated the supplemental vegetarian / vegan menu . i had the noodle salad as a starter and it was refreshing and full of fresh herbs . i had the spicy tofu rolls for my entree and shared several sides with my husband , including the amazing brussell sprouts and tofu fried rice . my husband had the filet with wasabi glaze and was impressed . the ambiance was very upscale and romantic as well . we would return on our next vegas trip .
asian	we went at 1 : 00am and all the sushi rolls were quite inexpensive - averaging $ 4-6 each . the fried rice was exceptional , we even ordered a second order ! between my husband and i , we ate 5 rolls , 2 orders of fried rice , and pot stickers . our drinks were constantly refilled and our server was kind and prompt . the bill even came quickly . clean , well priced , and very tasty ! everything was wonderful !
asian	absolutely love the yaki soba bowl , firecracker bowl , and the egg rolls are on point . always fresh and tastes great . protein shakes , smoothies and boba is killer , as well . awesome that it 's right next to the best nutrition store around , nutrition rush . can pick up my supplements at unbeatable prices and finish up with an incredible , healthy meal . boom , done . don 't go anywere else when you want teriyaki awesomeness . : )
asian	amazing restutante top notch fish and creative dishes , lived every single dish i had ordered te ambiance was incredible and the service was superb highly recommend it !
asian	ribletes to die for . pork bun is a party in your mouth . and the general taos was so great ... the chicken had perfect breading .
asian	i 've been a fan of this place since i lived in la. so glad to see them in town. try their spicy waba sauce on everything .
asian	we had lobster congee delicious but over the top and pricey . beef crepe funn roll was on target ! great service and it 's clean modern interior . strongly recommend checking this place out .
asian	the chicken defiantly superior to what i have had in the past . execution was excellent . the wavy steak amazing . they defiantly hit on all sides of the board , the food is pricey for what it really is , but it 's vegas defiantly no regrets .
asian	always get these . the seafood combo was not very good . pretty tasteless shrimp . oysters were not flavorful and lacked any juice . we were comped for the bad food but there is no excuse . vegetables were great and flavorful . fast service . friendly and drinks were delicious .
asian	phenomenal service that 's not easily seen at a sushi restaurant . a-must-go place in thornhill . highly recommended .
asian	very wide variety of any rolls you can imagine . along with fast and friendly service ! if you leave this place hungry you are doing it wrong .
asian	fresh sushi . great service . this place is probably is my new favorite sushi joint in the area .
asian	my favorite is the jalapeño poppers delightful bites of flash fried jalapeños filled with cream cheese and fresh spicy tuna ! their rolls are unique , fresh and delicious ! our favorite local sushi place ! service is friendly and attentive ! : )
asian	the creativity is amazing ! the quality of fish is like that of a 5 star restaurant . you will never get bored here . there 's over 100 rolls ! i always order the kelly d and then try something new each time . the rolls aren 't loaded down with rice like with ayce and the people that work there are fantastic ! !
asian	amazing family vibes authentic trini roti ! ! they even have sorrel . we had a great conversatjkn and they reminded me of home i will be coming back every time i visit toronto ! !
asian	the wait can be a bit long especially at peak times but it is all worth it ! : )
asian	butter chicken roti is to die for ! portions very generous their tikka chicken is also amazing
asian	amazing roti , i have had it numerous times and it is always great whether you like it spicy or mild they will make you smile .
asian	great flavours in the curries and other sauces and their roti is simply the best . customer service can he improved but nonetheless a great place to grab something fast .
asian	i highly recommend . food is fresh and the service is super quick .
asian	the curry rotis are my favorite . staff is helpful and friendly - my advice is to call ahead as it can take 20 minutes , so not a good place if you 're in a rush . always so fresh and you can request spicy or extra- spicy ( my fav ) . only a few seats but rarely full as every one gets take out . also , limited parking so if driving to try their roti ... it 's next to impossible to find a spot to pick up unless you park illegally on queensquay
asian	royal shrimp is so yummy my new favorite sushi place they have large combos will definitely come back here with more people great environment and excellent staff
asian	so many different options such as seaweed salad . also , very well priced . staff is super friendly .
asian	salt and pepper wings and pork chop , un choi thai style , fried shrimp wontons , and beef curry with rice .... everything was hot and delicious ! ! topped it off with a sweet roti ( must have ) and it was an incredible meal . can 't wait to come here again ! yum ! !
asian	their service is really great as well . as of this point the apple maps pin location is a bit off so be observant ! !
asian	i would eat lunch here everyday ! i had the viet special which was some pork cold cuts and pate . i tried everyone elses dish and they were all amazing ! highly recommend !
asian	the other speciality teas and drinks look amazing , will explore more on next visit !
asian	i recommend getting the special combinacion with extra pickled vegetables . very cheap .
asian	i always get the club with cucumber and onions . omg to die for even the bread is super fresh .. doesn 't look like much from the outside but .. seriously you have to try it
asian	i 'll be returning back to this place when ever i can ! good cheap meal & delicious ! ! !
asian	you can choose between pork or chicken . the meat was very well seasoned . toppings include cilantro , green pepper , jalapeño , cucumber , carrots , pickled onion , and other pickled vegetables . great flavor in the sauce and the veggies were very fresh . $ 6 for a huge sandwich on 1 / 2 a baguette . it is cash only . they have water and sodas for sale as well . there are tables next to bar marco where you can sit down and enjoy your glorious sandwich .
asian	tasty , warm , amazing soft buns . only thing i would complain about is the space . not really a place to dine in .
asian	the rock shrimp and spicy chicken are amazing as well . everything is great here and they have a lot of different choices .
asian	sat at the bar so we didn 't have to wait long . loved the coconut sake and the recommendation from our waitress . so yum ! if i 'm toronto , eat here !
asian	very great prices ! the buffet offers lots of choices and is very fresh ... a must try !
asian	seafood fried rice + pad thai are soooooo good . food comes fast and always tastes delicious , very generous portions as well ! ! ! ! !
asian	amazing seafood i ordered the crab and lobster combo for 4 but there was only 2 of us i had leftovers for two extra people which i brought home the lobster and crab was amazing the second dish of the king crab the steamed dish was amazing desert was also amazing and the manager elwis is awesome i would recommend this place for anyone looking for amazing lobster and king crab establishment i cant wait to go back
asian	it 's a small restaurant but very cozy . make sure to try the seafood tower . for that price it can 't be beat anywhere else .
asian	prices are on the steep side , but you really get what you pay for at this place . i went in a large group and they gave us 5 different plates of complimentary desserts at the end of our meal . what . one of which included a mango mochi . whaat . i would even rate it as better than the $ 5 ones you have to pay for at those chinese dessert houses . as someone with a proclivity for all things free , this definitely won me over as my favourite seafood spot uptown .
asian	sashimi always fresh . lobster roll is delicious . service is great ( rudy ) , always a friendly face . kabuki on thunderbird always has great happy hour as well .
asian	their sushi is really reasonably priced and they have an amazing vegan selection . if you 're looking for a swanky place to sit and dine , this may not be the place for you , but for take out or just some casual , delicious sushi , this place is awesome ! i really hope they succeed here !
asian	the tuna poke bowl is super yummy , i could eat that everyday !
asian	bulgogi and gyoza are two excellent menu items if you aren 't a fan of sushi , but the rolls are delicious .
asian	first time having omakase style sushi and it was a fantastic experience with my boyfriend . nigiri is the way to go .
asian	we order all you can eat via pads , pretty cool and amazing for big groups .
asian	serves pretty much only dumplings so you might be disappointed if you want other dishes . the restaurant is in a nice location but usually crowded . nice atmosphere and the prices are pretty good 7-9 dollars for an order of 12 dumplings ! i would recommend this for anyone who likes dumplings and wants a casual place to go !
asian	their sushi is bland and their quality can vary wildly , but their selection and quality of buffet food at good turnaround times makes up for it . overall my experiences have been positive for the price .
asian	their son has food alleegies so they take them very seriously . the steamed chicken buns are killer ! the food is high quality home cooking . we stocked our freezer and have yet to try sweet and sour chicken balls , breaded shrimp , lemon chicken and hot dog buns , just to name some of what they offer . the bbq pork bunk doesn 't have the sweet sticky pork you might except but it 's fresh and delicious . can 't wait to go back and stock up !
asian	and you can tell its freshly prepared ! ! what 's more important is that it taste fantastic ! this place offers hot bowls if you want something slightly stir fried or just a simple salad filled with freshly made vegetable with your choice or meat . and if you love a good panini you are in for a treat as well ! i come here regularly for a healthy and tasty meal , and the management and service has been friendly and delightful on day one ! highly recommend this place !
asian	excellent service and recommend it for every sushi lovers !
asian	everything else was standard buffet food but the sushi there is the best buffet sushi i 've had . i would say it would rival a lot of low quality restaurants . if i had to , i 'd spend all of my money on the sushi there and nothing else . i don 't care about the crab legs or the mongolian bbq or the other assorted things , the sushi there deserves a lot of respect coming from a buffet .
asian	i love the store and all it has to offer . the owner is super nice and extremely helpful . i love coming here and would recommend it to anyone .
asian	came with 14 courses of sashimi , sushi , flamed pork and a refresher in between . would definitely recommend checking it out , if you don 't mind spending a bit .
asian	i was full before i got to try even a quarter of the selection . i will definitely be back again and again . i am full , happy , and wishing i had a second stomach .
asian	seriously the best food i 've had in montreal . get their signature dish for 2 . loved this place .
asian	seriously the best pho in town ! ! i won 't go anywhere else . the owner takes great care of us every time we go in . our other favorites are the # 30 a veggie , shrimp and pork stir fry with steamed rice and the orange chicken ! ! delicious !
asian	not your typical sushi spot . they don 't use fake crab- 100 % alaskan kind crab in their sushi . the cold dishes are amazing . overall , phenomenal .
asian	she was the greatest . ramen was delicious . fried rice was amazing ! definitely coming back .
asian	the sushi is so fresh the serive is amazing ... ask for a private booth
asian	very fast with quality food ! ! , my favorite is the dragon and inaka roll along with the ahi poke . mm . def gotta try . i highly recommend .
asian	quality consistent with other locations across canada . noodles are freshly made in store , and the meat slices served are satisfying : do order the double portion if you like pork , or order the menu option with a side of meat slices . most interesting item on menu is the " tsukemen , " which are cold egg noodles served on the side but dipped in the hot broth served separately . only ramen shop known yo serve this type of ramen , special to the region of hokkaido .
asian	my date and i ordered the meat combo and it was perfect . we got to try multiple styles of the meats . we couldn 't have been happier . thanks ! !
asian	amazing food ! amazing view of the bellagio fountain ! after many nights of rich heavy food , i always stop by jasmine . i have never been disappointed . we always get the dim sum trio , hot and sour soup , lobster two ways and a variety of main courses . it 's just solidly yummy and the service is outstanding . the head waiter " paul " was amazing . we will be back every time . i would love it if they had organic produce and meat . sigh , one day ? keep up the good work jasmine . thank you
asian	amazing food ! ! ! a must for all thai food lovers ! ! !
asian	if you love a good strong coffee please try the vietnamese coffee and something new ( well for me ) the avocado shake . what a gem of a place .
asian	amazing food . i went with my boyfriend and his parents for his birthday . we started off with the crab rengoon . this is not your average chinese restraint style . the filling is not too much , and the pastry around it .. to die for ! same with the sauce it comes with ! his mom got the drunken noodle . it had such good flavor . between myself , my boyfriend and his dad , we tried three different currys . all amazing . we even got to try all three home made ice creams for his birthday . delicious ! i will be back for sure ! ! ! !
asian	amazing food . no complaints . check it out . staff gave us a free house salad which was also delicious . green monster & spicy rainbow rolls were unlike any others i 've ever had . please try this place .
asian	amazing food ! ! ! omg .... this place is so impressive ! ! the atmosphere is beautiful and victor was so sweet and personable ! ! and sam was the best server and so accommodating ! ! he made our dinner experience perfect . let us taste wine , jokes around with us , recommended dishes and we were so impressed ! ! ! thank you blossom ! ! we had a girls trip and we had reservations at stk , but last minute we canceled and came to blossom .... what a great choice ! ! !
asian	the crispy pork belly was flavorful and delicious ! uni shooter ! yummmmm ! ! ! ! the salmon skin salad is also a must try !
asian	amazing food ! ! ! the environment is also amazing ! what more can you ask for ! if you love to eat sushi and want all you can eat this is the place to go to ! ! my favorite is the rib eye , poke , and simply shrimp roll ! check it out and you will not be disappointed ! !
asian	they welcomed my " sleepy " baby cousin with open arms : ' )
asian	amazing service , amazing sushi i would definitely recommend this place for sushi lovers : d
asian	we came here for lunch to see our favorite server , courtney , and we absolutely loved it . she recommended our new favorites : tuna carpaccio , the sticky icky roll , and the ultimate taylor swift roll . spend the extra money and go for the deluxe ayce , you won 't regret it ! ! ! another plus is there awesome music selection . thanks for the awesome experience- you know we 'll be back !
asian	first ever time not doing all you can eat and all i have to say is wow . quality over quantity everytime !
asian	we got the dragon roll , salmon roll , california roll , and seaweed salad . we love taking home leftovers so it was the perfect amount . the food was so good !
asian	i tried the oxtail pho and it was everything i dreamed of . perfectly cooked and tender , ready to leave the bone and was very meaty . the soup base was flavorful and the meat was soaked in all the flovors . this has to be my favorite pho thus far ! ! definitely 5 / 5
asian	my wife and i are picky about our thai food , have tried countless different thai food places across chandler , tempe , and phoenix , but this is always our go-to spot . we 're here multiple times a month at varying times and always receive excellent service and fantastic food . we 've tried numerous items on the menu and can vouch for all of them--great , delicious , i 've never been more satisfied . i honestly can 't express enough how much we love the food here . please give it a try--lunch specials and dinner options are both affordable $ and well-worth trying !
asian	this place is a local favorite and gets very busy at lunch time . pro tip : get there early and order your macaroons the day before . they sell out fast !
asian	waiter was attentive and apologized about our appetizer coming out a little late . manager also came over and was very nice . food was delicious and very good portions . the szechuan chicken was good i got the normal one not the spicy kind . mark 's roll was a little spicy with the siracha but so delicious .
asian	you can definitely taste the freshness of the seafood here . uni here is excellent . also , the seafood soup is great-it is served in a teapot and you pour it in a small shot glass looking bowl which helps the soup to stay warm throughout the meal . i can tell the chef really cares about the quality of the food and making the dining experience flawless . i loved it !
asian	it 's a amazing restaurant i will definitely come back again ! great atmosphere and very calm . when you walk in they bring you free soup in a flash ! they have everything ! from maki to shrimp tampora ! this place rocks this will be my new hang place ! !
asian	i am not that adventurous , so i ordered a thai tea and was amazing . but they have so many selections and add-ons like boba and fruit or pudding ! love it !
asian	ordered street noodle # 1 and chiang mai curry which was absolutely delicious . they do not lie about the spice rating , thai hot is extremely hot but delicious ! fantastic food at a fantastic price !
asian	the owner offered to open the restaurant 15 minutes early as my girlfriend and i had to catch a play at 7 pm . food is decent and well done . nothing spectacular though .
asian	i love the jay cutler bowl ! you can not go wrong with this place . very healthy as well and great for macro managing !
asian	i had the chicken katsu and it was so good ! try their homemade coconut jam ! will definitely come back !
asian	it 's also a plus that they are open with dim sum so late ! would come back and enjoy again .
asian	it was our first time here and they happily explained all the sides and food . we were even lucky enough to get a how to use chopstick lesson : ) we enjoyed our dinner and will return any time we 're in vegas !
asian	will definitely be returning . had the cumin lamb , new york strip , hamachi jalapeño and tonkatsu ramen very very delicious ! had their special hamachi kama also it was okay i would 've just stuck with the regular hamachi jalapeño .
asian	food was awesome ! i loved it ! great place to order delivery from downtown. good coffee too !
asian	thai food can be found almost on every corner here in vegas , so it 's not always easy to find the good ones . i ordered the vegetable spring rolls as an appetizer and they were absolutely incredible . a vegetable curry followed . the service was quick and the flavors were spot on .
asian	the food was authentic szechuan and i will definitely be back the next time i am in vegas ! totally worth the trip off the strip for this place !
asian	coco rice with thai grilled chicken and mango curry would come back again
asian	they give you a free coffee mug with a review however they were out when it was shown ...... too bad ..... but , they did offer a free sake or dessert . the owner actually came by and gave us a roll on the house ...... good save , however i really preferred to have the mug : ) . now that 's nice .
asian	i highly recommend this fantastic restaurant to any sushi lover . definitely a must stop for great sushi .
asian	i love coming here every time i 'm in las vegas . i recommend doing the omakase so you can try all their signature dishes .
asian	i ordered the kung pao chicken and it was delicious . all meals come with rice and crab rangoons . this place 's crab rangoons are to die for . the restaurant itself is pretty low key and quiet . i 'd recommend this restaurant to those wanting some good chinese food in mahomet .
asian	place is well maintained and has ac - so bless . the portions are perfect and very filling- and that 's coming from a person who can eat a lot . warning the portions are big for the more expensive ramen . the cheaper ramen are still filling though even if you 're pretty hungry . good taste and perfectly chewy noodles .
asian	staff was always super friendly and helpful ! definitely in top 3 sushi spots in vegas .
asian	i visit this location quite often and always get the soup pork dumplings , which are my favourite . i also order the chicken and egg fried rice , the pork dumplings and the wonton soup . any complaints i did have in the past were fixed with great customer service , which is exactly how a business should be run . i have given feedback to the workers at this location , without expecting or asking for anything in return , and they have surprised me by fixing the issue or accommodating me , without even being asked ! highly recommend , this place is great ! if you 've been debating it , stop - just get in your car and go try this place out
asian	the fact that you cook the food on your table is a really cool concept .
asian	the staff are super friendly if you are a regular they know you and always welcome you with a warm greeting . their prices are very good and the quality and taste of the food is really good as well . two things i definite recommend here to order are the shrimp seaweed deep fried rolls and the chicken corn soup it 's so good .
asian	the sushi tastes very soft and fresh . plus we had the king crab fried rice which was pretty fantastic ! our server was very attentive and polite . the best service we received while in vegas for the weekend .
asian	love the tofu curry . ask for brown rice , tofu , or white rice alongside .
asian	we ordered the moo combo and the meat was very fresh . it is a little daunting so see slabs of meat in front of you but have no fear , moo woo 's servers soon swoop by and cook them to order . particular praise goes out to raphael , really attentive and fast . he 's really good at what he does . i flipped my rib eye and 3 seconds later , raphael appeared table side and checking on it . after i told him i already flipped it , he adjusted it so it could have the perfect diamond grill marks , talk about attention to details . highly recommended and a welcome addition to the north side .
asian	the food is delicious and the tom yum is out of this world .
asian	the best part is the scratch kitchen with most orders cooked when ordered and not premade sitting there dieing in a warmer . i 've had the pho and it is really good . the banh mi is good too ... just wish it had a little more meat and veggies .... that was the only thing holding me back from a 5 star review . this place is the real deal ... plain and simple .
asian	everyone was pleasant and helpful , and the pho was delicious ! will def be back many times !
asian	i expected hole in the wall service but was surprised by the friendly staff which is so hard to come by in vegas .
asian	amazingly , half rolls of sushi fill us up at just a few dollars more than all you can eat .
asian	joan was really helpful on explaining how the menu works because it was our first time , he also gave us really good service and i wouldn 't hesitate to come back here because of that . 10 / 10 would recommend !
asian	special shout out to jin for providing the best service i 've had in vegas yet !
asian	was not expecting this level of flavor out in the middle of concord but was definitely surprised . very affordable too .
asian	super friendly staff , very attentive and on top of things . jason duran was the manager when we dined and he was friendly and very welcoming . i 'm definitely coming back . oh , if possible try the tiger drink ... so yummy ! ! !
asian	crowded during peak hours , so make sure to manage your time properly .
asian	we stopped eating meat and they offered me extra vegetables instead and they take gave us a lot of vegetables . love it
asian	amazing service , and rolls were delicious : ) i am excited to return and try even more things on their menu .
asian	portions were very generous and the waitress took our leftover food and packed it up all nice to go . we will most definitely be eating here again when we come to vegas next . top notch thai !
asian	so fun too as it was our dad 's 70th and the mochi balls were delish !
asian	the knowledgeable waiters serve you and explain how it was prepared , what main ingredients it was prepared with , and the best way to enjoy it . i tried several dishes , everything was delicious , but my favorites were : the yellow tail sashimi with jalapeño , toro with truffle , ankimo monkfish liver topped with caviar , and the black cod lettuce wraps- in that order . dinner ended with the most delicious green-tea shaven ice- perfect ending as it was very refreshing . from this day forward nobu will be a must-go when in vegas .
asian	our server cody was friendly and helpful , and i love the music playing ! i had the vegas roll and miso soup and both were delicious !
asian	amazing service and sushi- i have been here on multiple occasions and i have zero complaints !
asian	i want to come back every weekend . modern contemporary atmosphere . didn 't use too much msg . i can 't wait to come back
asian	food is always solid as well . $ 3.05 for my chicken chow mein , fried rice , and an egg roll . that 's what i 'm talking about . the menu hasnt changed in 30 years . lets keep that a secret
asian	we love both the lunch and dinner menu . this is a quaint , affordable restaurant , and i would highly recommend it when searching for delicious thai food .
asian	huge portions too ! ! ! the dumplings were awesome and so was the plum wine and echigo beer was delicious too ! ! ! ask for daniel as your server he was awesome .
asian	for some reason , i disliked my mai tai so they let me order another drink with no problem . the food was great as usual but for me was missing that unique roy 's touch that i 've seen both in hawaii and florida . the special roll for the summer was awesome . fresh , good fish . the korean fried rice side dish was only okay . drinks are strong--i liked the drink with the date in it ( like 1928 or something ) . it was slightly sweet .
asian	they focus on all your senses . it 's a complete dining experience with great music , lighting , and artwork . the vegan pho is incredible , with a rich broth and vegetables that you don 't often see , like mushrooms . the water comes infused with a mix of fresh fruit . it 's byob , which only adds ti the atmosphere and the personalized nature of their service .
asian	best advice i have is go on during the lunch buffet , they have really good service too !
asian	super friendly and accommodating staff . we were immediately acknowledged as we walked in . great ambiance . food is delicious ! they have a wide selection of seafood & sushi . we will be back for more .
asian	great food that comes in considerable portions . would recommend to anyone and will be back .
asian	he will give you tips on what to choose , the house special sushi was great and the hibachi was excellent .
asian	beautiful flavours keeps me coming back for more and they have a bar , double + . i love the pasta and the chili oil she drizzles on is amazing . a must try and takeout option is there as well . dont forget to add cheese . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = priya = = = = = =
asian	surprisingly , the ramen is a big focus in there-- had the garlic shoyu ramen , strong garlic flavour over ride the actual soup taste so i would recommend getting the kotteri rich shoyu instead where u can actually taste the creaminess of the broth . lunch menu is limited in choices but overall food presentation and taste was good ( we also had chirashi don--very authentically made ) . nice decor and conveniently located so you can hop over to the movies right after dinner ~
asian	decent pricing . all you can eat is worth the price . food was great . really likes how the staff was attentive and we had zero issue with getting what we ordered because of the ipad menus . thought that was neat .
asian	definitely a fun spot . went with my family and we really enjoyed the atmosphere here . there are many things to choose from . they also give complimentary appetizers that are delicious !
asian	i must say though , the sashimi plates here were so good . i could eat it all day . the nigiri was just okay . i 've had better at local ayce sushi joints around town ! the blue fin toro , jalapeño sashimi , surf n turf they set ablaze right in front of you ! these lettuce wraps , black cod or sea bass ? delicious nonetheless ! so so so good ! ! !
asian	all you can eat for $ 21.95 yes yes yes . very creative names too . i would come back when in vegas next .
asian	delicious sushi ! great happy hour specials ! this new restaurant lives up to the reviews . super fresh food , lovely servers .
asian	dropped by to ask about the teppenyaki , and was wowed by their friendliness and stayed for lunch ! booked a reservation for my birthday and i am excited ! great place !

asian	excellent sushi . very reasonable prices . kevin and michael are the best ! i have been coming here for over 10 years . i will never go anywhere else .

asian	first time in the shop , manager explained everything about their wonderful concept . took grab-n-go and they were 30 % for end of the day special ! definitely going back ! # sushis
asian	beautiful looking decor . so happy they came to canada . hopefully the cheesecake factory will soon follow . p.s. the banana spring roll dessert is to die for ! ! !
asian	best thai food in the hood ! ! check it out & thank me later . spring rolls , yellow curry & pad thai were top-notch !
asian	the menu is a mix between vegetarian and meat dishes over rice or noodles . yum ! this place is a wonderful quick spot for healthy lunch . when they cook their veggies , they do not come out soggy or salty , they are still packed with their nutrients and have a great crunch . the food is prepared very well . the business hours vary , so make sure its open if you are in a hurry ! they have home made sauces as well as a mix of hot sauces and the dreaded ghost peppers ! fantastic little stop and very affordable .
asian	my husband doesn 't really like any type of asian food but he really liked this place which is great for us since kids & i love it . very clean and great service . our waiter kept checking on without being annoying lol . it 's pretty hidden behind the main building on ann rd but we will absolutely be back .
asian	amazing service. food was good and no msg. price increased a little but still very reasonable. mango rolls were really good but maki rolls were ok not too good .
asian	food was reasonably priced and delicious . large menu with unique rolls . very friendly staff that was happy to customize rolls too .
asian	freshest of product and both traditional and modern takes on japanese cuisine !
asian	all you can eat and fills you up ! amazing food for people who don 't enjoy sushi and people who love sushi . 100 % recommend . the dessert is also amazing !
asian	always exceptional presentation , and fresh sushi . we usually receive free extras courtesy of the chef ! the restaurant is clean with modern decor and fresh flowers . easy to access and we have yet to wait a prolonged period of time for our food .

asian	i love the meat bowls , and the spam-misubi is the bomb ! ! get there soon for a good value !
asian	very friendly & funny . treat us very well ! thank you so much for your outstanding service ! i will come back & definitely ask for kenny as my server ! thank you !
asian	the quality of food is great and for a reasonable price . it is worth the wait ! !
asian	from the hostess , waitress and even the busser that made sure i got another beer ! the food is exceptional and the green papaya salad is a must !
asian	i had a miso soup for my entree , the ingredients were fresh and the soup hearty . the gozya was a grat appetizer which went great with their cocktails . a cute place and worth every penny . you will most definitely leave happy and with warm soup belly .
asian	i 've heard lots of things about here , one day i was in the area so i decided to give it a try . she recommended me the taro milk , love how i can choose soy milk instead of regular milk .
asian	some of the best customer service i 've had in a while ! friendly welcoming and had good recommendations ! ! dragon roll was awesome ! !
asian	great banchan ! wonderful food ! the staff is extremely nice and accommodating . both lunch and dinner offerings are impressive . i 've been several times and plan to keep going back !
asian	cozy atmosphere and reasonable prices ! crispy egg noodles with beef were amazing so was the traditional pad thai !
asian	great food . not your typical thai dishes . i think i still prefer pai or sabai sabai , which serve more typical thai dishes .
asian	the sushi was fresh ! loved it ! we tried lunch special another day and that was good too . the staff are very friendly . definitely going back there .
asian	great food . we were craving jjamppong and jjajangmyun , and this place totally hit the spot . delicious chewy noodles , flavorful broth and sauce , and ample portion sizes !
asian	it was obviously our first time at an authentic indian restaurant and everyone was very kind and informative ... yes the plates are styrofoam and the cutlery plastic ... but the food and service make everything fun and kinda like an indoor picnic ..... yum yum yum ... so many choices can 't wait to go back
asian	she even helped me make a nummy mix to dip the beef in as i was ignorant to the world of pho . also , i love that they have three hot tea choices : jasmine , oolong , and green !
asian	since the place is owned and operated by a young couple , you can expect quality and consistency . i have been going to sake regularly since they started ( last year ) and they have never failed to disappoint . they also have live jazz music every thursdays .
asian	will be returning shortly . come after 10 : 00 to access the happy hour menu , thank me later .
asian	amazing service , great quality food , and the green tea ice cream sandwich is on point !
asian	great quality food and very flavorful . came in and our waiter took us through all the good things they have .
asian	great selection , and it 's one of the best ayce places i 've ever been . the sushi roll orders come in 4 or 6 , which is perfect when you want to try a couple different types of rolls . everything came very quickly , the servers were on top of reordering and drink refills , which you rarely see ! and it 's right downtown at yonge and college . i wish they had sashimi included in ayce but everything else was spot on !
asian	great tempura , sushi was not the best but i 'm not fan of sushi regardless . a decent place to grab a quick lunch or dinner at incredible prices !
asian	their asian / hawaiian fusion was perfect . we 'll be back !
asian	came in and at first was overwhelmed by people asking to get me drinks but ended up loving the attention all the people that work here give . servers were on point about all menu items . never had an empty glass ... ever ! ! good was good had the spicy beef noodle soup , wings for appetizer , but the yellowtail collar ( hamachi kama ) oh man ! ! ! i was obsessed ! so good . i 'd go back for just that ! !
asian	i came here last night for my birthday dinner and everyone was so sweet the servers and chef kevin ! the food was so good ! ! ! i 'm definitely coming back ! ! i loved it !
asian	i love the blazing shrimp roll . the kids loved the popcorn shrimp roll and the ice cream . if you like sushi and live in north scottsdale , you should give blu a try !
asian	it was my second time coming in today and they got my takeout love boat tray a finished in less than 10 minutes .
asian	i also loved their spring rolls which i could make a meal out of alone . their pho ga was a little on the bland side i found sadly otherwise i would be there all the time . the rest of the food we had was very good and very fresh . this place cares about their food and their customers .
asian	service is always consistent and welcoming ! food is well portioned and cheap . small location but cozy !
asian	service is always great we come here for happy hour at least once a week . my faves are the tempur roll and the vegas !
asian	kenny was the best ! very knowledge of the food made amazing recommendation ! we will definitely be returning on a regular basis with service like kenny ! thanks for the dope time !
asian	ken , the owner , kept my friends and me laughing the entire time we were here on our last leg of vacation . the food was fresh and delicious . i would make it a point to come back here next time i am out in vegas because of my experience .
asian	i 'll be making a pit stop here every time i 'm in town from now on . strongly suggest yellowtail sashimi , high roller roll , sunny salmon roll . happy hour was legit . $ 5 dolla make you holla .
asian	love the food ! i would recommend the pho spicy beef soup to anyone . i have been going here for a little over a year and have never been disappointed .
asian	love the people there , and of course , the food . my favorites are the pad thai , volcano chicken , and masaman curry .
asian	it was very delicious and i highly suggest the pork bun . this is definitely a place to eat at if you go to china town .
asian	my water glass was always full and i drank about 4 glasses of water . the staff was very polite and courteous . it was slow nut multiple staff members made an effort to ensure my wife and i were taken care of . the food was great we the new zealand mussels in dynamite sauce it was one of the best appetizers i 've ever had at a japanese restaurant . for the sushi we got the t.t girls and crazy girl rolls they were great . all kaizen was a great place to grab an early sushi dinner . thanks kaizen staff
asian	amazing service ( naomi & jessica ) , they made great recommendations and the bowl of seoul makes my soul complete !
asian	food is bomb to . come here like twice a month ! !
asian	our server was josh . he was soooo tentative , always on it , asking if we needed anything and he had a lot of tables to serve too ! ! and they were so fast in getting out what we ordered ! the specialty rolls were so different and the names were classic .. " call a doctor vs. friday the 13th . " too fun ! ! ! !
asian	our waiter pat was exuberant , respectful , and nice . the food was delicious and came out quick and hot . the curry was spicy at the " hot " level . i 'd work my way up and not just jump right into the hottest level . id recommend trying the satay and red curry . will come back again .
asian	amazing service out waiter wad great but besides the service our food was five star top notch amazing i had the red dragon the sea dragon and the dragon rolls and they were some of the best sushi i have ever had in my life and that 's saying slit because i am a sushi fanatic my boyfriend had the peppered beef with snow peas and the meat was so tender and juicy you almost didn 't need to chew it ... melt in your mouth doesn 't even come close to how good it was it is a must go to and we will be back for sure
asian	peanut noodles are my favorite , but that yang chow fried rice and those giant chunks of bbq pork . can 't finish all the food in one sitting but they are definitely worth taking home for later
asian	they even gave me an egg roll for free . the teriyaki sauce is light yet flavorful without overpowering the meat . the rice is expertly cooked , this is probably the best authentic food i 've had in the area .
asian	food was on point and i will be coming back again .
asian	reasonable prices and the best sushi i 've had in this neighborhood ! can 't wait to go there again or order from them because they are only about 5 blocks from my place and they deliver ! highly recommended !
asian	staff is kept to a minimum intentionally and the owner personally serves you and constantly checks on your wellbeing . i will absolutely come back here for the owner alone , his personality is a true rarity when it comes to service . the food was also incredible and the only change i would make is to displaying the salads / side dishes .
asian	so friendly ! thai tea was so delicious . the food was great ! this has become my new favorite thai restaurant .
asian	amazing service ... the angry dragon roll is awesome but comes with way too much sauce , which is a little too much in large quantities .
asian	the best lychee martini in town food was delicious ! a1 service ! will be coming back for sure ! ! !
asian	the food is always fresh and cooked perfectly . i have no idea why it isnt more popular i am a huge foodie and this is better than most asian restaurants in the strip .
asian	the fish was cooked to perfection . perfectly crispy outside and perfectly soft and mouthwatering on the inside . the green curry was amazing too !
asian	i had the sashimi deluxe and i couldn 't finish it ! miso soup , salad and a crab meat salad , and 15 pieces of amazing quality fish . if you 're are hesitant don 't be , wow ! ! i can 't believe this here . won 't be able to stay away !
asian	the front house opened the door for us when we entered and left . the service was so great and friendly ! the fried rice was okay but the chicken pad thai and ground chicken entree was so delicious ! i highly recommend coming here not only for the tasty and delicious food but also for the great service !
asian	the happy hour phenomenal ! ! ! $ 3 / $ 4 meats , 1 / 2 off drinks and more . everything on happy hour is $ 2-4 ! the service was perfect and the food was perfect as well . will definitely go back for my next vegas adventure !
asian	if you get them though be careful of the soupy liquid in them ! it 's the best part ! ! oh , and they have homemade chow mein noodles ! ! ! ! ! the crispy beef is one of their signature dishes and i personally found it a bit hard , but the sauce was still delicious . we will definitely be back for more momo 's and to try and few more things ! ps . their hot sauce is amazing ... we had some left over and i put them into home made burgers the next night ... , delish ! ! !
asian	there sides are the best . the fish cakes are amazing and so is the radish and kimchi . only place i go for kbbq . never a long wait for a table .
asian	the sushi chefs and hostess were so friendly . the sushi was phenomenal . delicious and fresh . this was better than any other place i 'd eaten
asian	the sushi was okay but the yellowtail taquito , although not really a taquito , was my favorite .
asian	the tuna tataki salad is my fav but there is a huge variety of fancy rolls as well as more traditional fare . i have also had great take-out experiences from here as well ( fast and carefully packaged ) .
asian	the waitress was well informed and able to give suggestions . food was fantastic . there 's just the right amount of selection and variety . each plate was artfully presented . dishes were delicious . great ambience .
asian	this is my go-to dinner every other tuesday before i hit up the $ 5 movie night at south point . the marinated chicken and shrimp box is my favorite ! boyfriend always orders the steak ( medium ) and shrimp box , both orders are always cooked to perfection . the chef takes his time to actually speak with the customers and ensure they feel comfortable and his recommendations never fail . can 't forget the shrimp tempura with the poke sauce . man that poke sauce is the best ! every time i visit i never see anyone else dine in , only to-go orders , i recommend staying for lunch / dinner , you won 't regret it ! : )
asian	tyler and his family provide excellent customer service . they definitely remember their regular customers ! they explain the menu very thoroughly and answer any questions you have ! happy hour every day 5pm-6pm . this is a must try place !
asian	very accommodating and awesome sushi roll. really loved the spicy tuna roll , vegetable rolls , and crispy shrimp appetizer
asian	the food is delicious with big portion sizes and is well worth its cost ! i love the spicy calamari and the vegetables compliment it very well . the chicken egg flower soup was perfect and the orange chicken and mongolian chicken was very tender . the kung pao chicken was super tasty but very spicy because we asked for maximum spice so i 'd suggest go with the spice that it comes with . other than that , the experience we 've had here is pleasurable .
asian	service was top notch , everyone knew what they were talking about and knew their food .. by far hands down best sushi i 've ever had . you have to try it
asian	we had each course and each was better than before . highly recommended the fried rice balls dipped in soy sauce and spicy tuna . if it wasn 't so expensive , i 'd eat here every day !
asian	we had joe as our teppan-yaki chef and he was entertaining . the waitress staff was there at every moment . we have visited several teppan restaurants and the service is by far the best !
asian	we were in midst of dinner when the tornado sirens sounded . not only were staff helpful in finding us safety ( parking garage stairwell ) they also provided free edamane and made sure all had appropriate beverages . when we returned to the table our food was ready to go and all happy to serve . the spicy tuna special roll is now a top favorite - texture and taste beautifully balanced and artful reminders of the ocean .
asian	have been ordering takeout recently as well and the quality is just as good . the beef short ribs and the dumpling casserole are incredible !
asian	it 's so refreshing to see a sushi place of this calibre in vegas ! their menu has such a great selection to choose from , even for the pickiest of eaters . i 'll definitely be back !
asian	this please is must to try if you like shabu ! ! ! paul is awesome ! ! ! ! great customer service and delicious food : )
asian	the best part - unlimited veggies . there 's also free refills on salad , rice , and sauces . the sesame peanut sauce was extra delicious . there 's even free ice cream at the end !
asian	sweet people ! we drive 15 mins to go here when there are many thai places closer .
asian	i come here all the time , and there 's something for everyone .. vegetarian , pescetarian , carnivore .. it 's always a reliable meal , cheap , healthy and tasty ! not necessary a romantic place though , since it 's a converted 50 's diner .
asian	shrimp and scallops in garlic sauce was not as good as the amazing dish , but held it 's own . hot and sour soup very spicey , but again good . egg drop seemed different than most places ..... not a fan of it . good staff , clean and good atmosphere .
asian	i mostly get delivery , and they are fast and friendly . my favorite is the chicken dish that is shown in the profile pic . it 's very spicy and seasoned with ginger , garlic and red peppers and so good . there are two versions of their menu : american and chinese . i 'm an adventurous eater , so i usually order off the chinese , but certain items are on both , such as the mapo tofu- yum ! i 've found my go-to chinese place in pittsburgh !
asian	they used to make the best kung pao tofu ... but this time , i wanted to go with my current favorite sichuan dish .. dan dan noodles . they were amazing but i shouldn 't have ordered them for lunch ... they were no way enough for me . as always , the service was fast and the food was tasty . really miss this place .
asian	never really was attracted to noodle spots and did this place complete on a whim . turned out that i will be going back soon . great service . no crazy frills other than quickly made meals that taste fantastic . pork buns are good would like one more for the price , but it 's cool . ordered chiang mai curry , fire ! also , kee mao , which i thought was better than the mai curry . either way awesome little spot that got a space in my stomach .
asian	simple menu and a fantastic mix of flavors . even our kids , who are not familiar with sushi , scarfed down their food . adults had yo adrian , kids had the junior , and pb & a available bowl .
asian	... simply amazing food and great atmosphere .... my wife and i went for dinner we got 3 rolls 2 bowls of miso soup and a amazing teriyaki steak dinner and topped it off with chocolate mousse desert and we loved every bite . this is are new favorite restaurant .
asian	simply amazing . the food is incredible . it 's unique and tastes amazing . why it only 3.5 starts on yelp is a mystery to me and everyone else i know who has tried this place . we came here on first friday and it wasn 't packed . they seated us right away and the servers were very sweet and funny . lovely atmosphere . i will definitely be coming here again ! !
asian	after a long night of clubbing , this is the perfect spot to go to
asian	had the uni bomb and the moto eggs and a moto bun all were delicious ! also the iggy smalls cocktail was lovely ! will definitely be back next time i 'm in toronto . the staff is also very nice and accommodating- especially the host- so sweet ! sat me at a great spot at the chefs counter : )
asian	small menu but done well . banh no was amazing and the hawaiian burger was fabulous ! plus the groupon was a deal ! !
asian	we tried four tolls and all of them are amazing . the dynamite roll was one of the best rolls i have had in months . it 's worth a trip out to this place to have an amazing meal .
asian	amazing smoothie to accompany your meal. food tastes great , not the hugest quantity but well worth the money .
asian	so absolutely delicious and tasty . i had the teryaki chicken and it was fresh , crispy and very flavorful . i went with a group of girls for happy hour and it was one of the most enjoyable dining experiences i had while i was in phoenix in july . just delightful .
asian	so delicious , reasonable , very fast and you can see the kitchen ( i like that because you can see the food being made ) . the people working are always so kind and nice and if you 're a regular they throw in extras if you tip . love this place !
asian	so good for the price . not pricey but great quality . the atmosphere is very sophisticated and the servers are super well mannered and kind . recommend it 100 % !
asian	so in love with this place ! the food is amazing , fish is fresh and delicious and their sauces are super yummy ! ! ! definitely going back !
asian	so i would try to go early as the wait can get pretty long . but they do take your number and call you when your table is ready , so just plan for that and go get a drink near by . the squash fritters and khao soi with beef are to die for . we went with a large group and everyone loved their food , so i 'm sure you can 't go wrong with anything on this menu . the servers were very attentive , and the girl on the door is awesome , no matter how long the wait she is way to cute to get mad at . we will definitely be back and i can 't wait !
asian	some of the best korean bbq . being korean it is easy to be picky about korean bow places and it was awesome !
asian	sooo freaken delicious ! ! we got the spicy samurai roll and the volcano roll and they were amazing ! probably the best sushi i 've had !
asian	this truck has quality food . we ate it outside of resident culture what a treat ! ! i wish the dumpling lady would park outside my house on the reg ! ! tasty as hell ! !
asian	broth is incredible ! ba mi sandwiches were a bit of a dissapointment- i did not enjoy their style of bread , maybe others will .
asian	fabulous ! only place with better is thai house .
asian	had their papaya salad , laos sausage and panang curry and washed it down with a thai mojito . just so many flavors at the same time , all playing off each other !
asian	ing. so yummy . both of us had seafood dishes . very generous portions . i had red thai curry-house special . i had # 1 spicy . yum . hubby had the royal thai dinner w green curry . it came spicy so be sure to say if you want less spicy . staff is super friendly and on point . will be back .
asian	this broth is the most flavourful of their ramens , and is highly addictive . i come here all the time , and their food is delicious and consistent . hint-you can ask for nonspicy or 0.5 spicy for this ramen . also , the tsukemen is awesome too
asian	loved every bit of it , recently opened the vibe is amazing . my sister had the yaki soba which was also very delightful . all recommendations of the hostess that sat us . very friendly employees . food was so good the cook was serenaded by my friend ! lol
asian	the sushi rice was fresh and delicious . fast and friendly service . everything was great except for dem bruk up seats all ripped up and ting and minimal parking .
asian	pho is out of this world and other dishes i have tried , such as the vermicelli and spring rolls , are fantastic . iced coffee is dynamite . above all else , the service shines through . food is served quickly and always with a smile and great attitude . restaurant is very clean . the place loads up during lunchtime so plan accordingly .
asian	had the black cod with miso melt in your mouth delicious but doesnt come with as much sauce as nobu 's which is better . fois gras steamed buns were really good . cocktails graeat as well . you should eat here
asian	i come here 2-3x a week . probably the best in vegas . everyones friendly and the selection is amazing . they also have complimentary tea that is pretty good . perfect meal if you are on a lo carb diet as the poke can be made into a salad . they also have a hot cheeto burrito that looks good and fairly popular it seems . def recommended .
asian	even the lychee beer is delicious . the nigori strawberry sake is sweet & delicious , it tastes almost like milk shake .
asian	sushi tasted light and fresh . i liked that the rolls had less rice and more meat ~ excellent ! ! ! much different than what i 've normally had . cool decor , friendly service . we went during the day , but looks like this place would be a lot of fun at night ! ! check em out if your in town ~
asian	also a great date spot , music and background music is perfect for it
asian	the service is great but best of all the price is low and great food
asian	can 't wait to try their soup ; ) perfect lunch date place
asian	we have become regulars here and the service is always outstanding . i love the spring rolls and if you are vegetarian or pescetarian this place has you covered . the pho is quite authentic but leans toward the healthy side without losing the great taste . seriously best vietnamese spring rolls anywhere . this is our favorite restaurant in phoenix .
asian	the best i 've had . delicious thai tea . service is always great and the waiters and waitresses are very pleasant and friendly . love this place ! !
asian	the pho was very flavorful and they give you lots of basil to put in it .
asian	owners are so humble and welcoming .. had my bachelorette dinner here and the staff took great care of us !
asian	amazing staff , amazing menu selection .. so friendly and hospitable .. once you become a regular the staff greet you with a handshake , which is very warm and makes you feel at home .. the food is delicious and there is something for everyone .. and the portions are quite big .. this place is a hidden gem and i recommend it to everyone !
asian	reminded me of a poke stop in hawaii but even better . if they were out of it they had no problem making more . very very friendly staff . wouldn 't expect anything less from hawaii let a lone a 5 star poke stop . thanks guys . i 'll be back for more for sure
asian	this is the spot for all your california roll & beef teriyaki needs . one chef named james stands out above the rest , great job guys , 5 stars !
asian	i ordered the crispy snapper in the sand which is mouth watering along with a " sts " roll .
asian	i love coming here to eat . the food is priced good and the place is always clean when i come here . also the food comes out in a timely manner every time i come here .
asian	very clean and friendly place ! i would definitely recommend for others .
asian	cheap and fresh ! the grilled beef banh mi tastes like juicy jerky perfectly balanced with the freshness of the veggies .
asian	everyone was so pleasant and nice and very attentive . the waitress gave wonderful recommendations and the managers came to check on us many times . the food was great as well ! we ordered many small eats as well as shared 2 dishes for 4 people . we were going out that night so didn 't want to eat too heavy . dim sum was amazing as well as the duck salad . i recommend getting their drinks . we didn 't like one of them and they had no problem returning it and getting us a different one . perfect place to have a romantic date or a night out with the girls / guys !
asian	high quality sushi with incredible selection . i 'm a regular and i love coming here at least twice a month . they treat my family with sincere care . we 're usually a large group and they always accommodate . i have a 9month old who loves their miso soup . the aj special is the best but if you 'd like the full experience of great sushi , sit at the bar ! do some sake bombs and enjoy their great selection . thank you guys for always making it a wow experience ! ! !
asian	really great and friendly ! ! ! we 're excited to come back here to dine in next time . : ) we ordered the moscow roll , spicy salmon , and dinner for 2 ) )
asian	amazing staff ... so sweet and translated everything word by word for us from the menu ( were from toronto ) ... food was amazing ... reasonably pric ed
asian	busy but quick to get us a table . get the pad thai , thai spicy , amazing ! but if you 're with a group of friends just share and order different dishes because it 's a shame not to try more than one ! street style was also delicious . braised beef in one of our dishes was incredibly tender , and i am not always a meat eater . great for leftovers . got the shrimp chips to share as an appetizer , good big basket to share with a group . got the house beer . a place with a small menu is usually a good sign- every item we had , they did it well ! craving it regularly now !
asian	they work in unison and that 's very important with korean bbq . loved the experience and the good was good just like i was back in garden grove , ca
asian	started off with takoyaki , best takoyaki in town that ive had . i got the seafood rmen with 2 dried nor . thin noodles good options for spice . would definitely go back .

asian	we bought the bbq pork and the chicken and it was awesome . $ 9.50 for two sandwiches ! yum ! highly recommend !
asian	such a better atmosphere , more attentive and friendlier staff , and a much bigger space compared to the other yama sushi location ! ! ! ! only downside is that most of their option of rolls are spicy . i wish they had more of a variety
asian	such a fantastic find off the strip - i 've been to lv so many times that i have tried nearly every overpriced restaurant on the strip from koi to katsuya to nobu ... and this place was soooo much better ! we did the 11 course omasake and it was to die for ! the presentation of each dish was impeccable , and everything tasted so great ! we had to dine very quickly due to a show reservation and the restaurant was very accommodating in getting us through efficiently . definitely will be back !

asian	amazing sushi .. a little expensive but a great treat every now and then we ordered the las vegas rolls and didn 't expect the fried veggies to come with but they were an amazing treat with the rolls
asian	excellent food would do again ... wait time is about 1 hour ...... go for it !
asian	all you can eat lunch for a very affordable price . the sushi was made to order and came out quickly .

asian	lychee sorbet was to die for . highly recommend ! ! !
asian	ask for recommendations on house rolls . the chimichunga roll ( which every server calls " chimichanga " ) is awesome though a little spicy .
asian	everyone was super friendly - my husband and i sat at the bar and chatted with the chefs , and the servers asked us often how things were . for the record , the oh my roll was the best ! ! highly recommend !
asian	free delivery , too - how much better can it get ? when i don 't have time to cook , these guys are my " go to "

asian	amazing sushi and great lunch box specials every day. if you 're in the steele creek area of charlotte , cross the border and come to this place .
asian	the waitresses on the other hand could use some work . for instance stand around talking to each other when you have asked for water twice . had to track one down to get my check . i think she was expecting a tip cuz i had to actually ask for my change . ha !
asian	and great service . their shrimp tempura and spicy salmon sushi pizza are bomb ! !
asian	i can not wait to go again . my 5 year old son loved everything we ordered and the sushi was fresh and delicious . i recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area ! !

asian	everything tasted wonderful , but the rolls were a tad big . good atmosphere , friendly staff , fast service , clean bathroom . it 's affordable , so i don 't feel like i have to work hard to get my money 's worth ; but don 't let that fool you . i would still come here if they charged double .

asian	and the biggest rarity in vegas , it 's actually a japanese sushi bar ! great stuff . to set some context about what i like , i prefer nigiri and my favorites are uni and ikura . both are excellent . yes i think that qualifies me as a die hard sushi fan : ) . the service is always exceptional ! sushi on rianbow is in my weekly rotation . this is a must frequent !
asian	a group of 3 of us ordered a combination platter which showed up on a freaking boat with all these different types of fish and it was all delicious . if i lived here i would go ham on this place . only con is that it 's a bit small but totally worth it .
asian	i 've been to nobu and in my opinion this place ranks right up there with it , possibly higher since the prices are so much more reasonable . the service is fantastic . we even met the owner who greeted us with a complimentary menu item . black cod , poke tostadas , hamachi--everything is amazing . don 't let the small , unassuming location deter you from an amazing meal at a reasonable price ! !
asian	this has become our go to place for sushi . we 've had so many different pieces of sushi and sashimi and it 's always delicious .
asian	also , great happy hour 4-7pm ! cheap but professional , food was literally delivered to our table within 2 mins of ordering each course . had multiple items , but the spicy tuna on crispy rice was exceptional , ordered a second one after the first ! visit !
asian	sushi chefs are really friendly and good at what they do . highly recommend .
asian	having lived in hawai 'i for 9 years this was a pleasant surprise to find in charlotte . the poki ( poke for the hawaiians ) is amazing as was every sushi roll we ordered . this place is small and packed . the take out orders and queue for being seated are ridiculously large . go early ( 6pm ) or plan to wait ! or , order take out and arrive when it 's ready , it 'll probably be a better choice than showing up at 7 : 30pm any evening .
asian	we 've had sushi here for the first time about 3 weeks ago . since then , we have came back at least 3 more times . i love the " oh my god " and " tiger roll " it is amazing ! great service , great food , fast turn around and best all you can eat prices . sometimes the place gets crowded but the wait is well worth it ! we absolutely love it here .
asian	clean restaurant with speedy , friendly service . best rainbow roll my husband and i had ever had . will definitely be returning to this gem .
asian	ultimate tuna , rich and famous , steak roll , kiss of fire , and gladiator rolls are some of our favorites .
asian	we started with the tempura veggies , which were wonderful - i could 've eaten an entire plate of the mushrooms . then we had an order of the crab dragon rolls , which was very good . and an order of the yellow dragon rolls . i 'm telling you , the yellow dragon rolls are officially my favorite sushi rolls that i 've ever had in my entire life . i would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes sushi .
asian	ayce was such a save and had great sushi . very fresh . the customer service was good as well . this will be one of our main sushi joints .
asian	amazing sushi bar , fresh food , decent portions , reasonably priced - definitely beats any of the all-you-can-eat-sushi restaurants in waterloo / kitchener area .
asian	it 's a buffet but by the quality of food you would never know it . they have a variety of asian foods including some great hawaiian katsu . they must have 50 different types of sushi and all of it 's very fresh . this place received 5 dumplings and is a must visit when in vegas .
asian	great quality , fresh tasting unbelievable service ! presentation is beautiful !
asian	prices are good and great selection . very authentic .
asian	best sushi for miles around ! all you can eat ! great service ! can 't complain when your happy !
asian	if you are ever in the vegas area ... skip the strip sushi all you can eat buffets . this is place is where you should definitely check out . the sushi rolls are not your typical fair of sushi rolls . everything i had was delicious !
asian	had the rockport sushi burrito . though service wasn 't so friendly look as if some of the workers hated their lives . a bit on the pricy side compared to other sushi burrito places i 've been too . on the other hand what won me over is the food . would love to come back some time .
asian	what ! ! ? ? yes , i said sushi burritos . crazy idea , but it comes together so well ; with fresh , fresh fish , as well as all other ingredients . i had the baja ; nice and spicy with jalapeños , spicy tuna , ahi , cilantro , cabbage , and a few other ingredients . so good , i want to try everything on the menu ! this is a must for any sushi lover looking for a fresh take on the way we eat sushi ! !
asian	called for take out and the service was excellent . prices were exceptional for the quantity and quality of our food . rolls were delicious and unique . highly recommended ! !
asian	sushi chef alex is wonderful ! recommend to sit at sushi bar and watch his skill ! !
asian	definitely the best in las vegas , amazing service & absolutely amazing sushi ! ! !
asian	definitely the best in town ! my husband and i come here all the time . it is a little more pricey than the other sushi places but well worth it . every roll i have had there is good which makes it hard to choose . my typical go to 's are the crunchy tuna , philly , & volcano . the drinks are pretty awesome too . there is a red sidecar that is bomb but isn 't on the menu anymore ( they will still make ) . the downs ... long waits for dinner . if you have a group of 4 or more , call for a reservation . don 't let the wait discourage . it is worth it !
asian	your extra couple bucks really goes the distance here ! their fish is always delightfully fresh and i love the use of the blow torch to add texture and flavour to nigiri . i miss their lunch special , though .
asian	even better service . i really have a hard time spending more money on sushi when yume is htis good .
asian	everything in vegas is pricey , and this is no exception . however , when the food is amazing and the sushi chef is knowledgeable , it 's worth it ! prices weren 't too bad ... i usually check the prices of the spicy tuna roll ( since every sushi place has them ) for comparison . the spicy tuna rolls at sushi roku were $ 11 . again , expensive , but not over the top . and for delicious sushi , i 'll take it any day ! make sure you go here - much better than yellowtail sushi in the bellagio , and less expensive too !
asian	friendly servers and nice atmosphere . the music is also very nice with different genres that still fit the theme .
asian	the chefs tell a beautiful story through their omakase tasting . some of the best quality fish i have ever tasted . highly recommended !
asian	it 's hidden , right off charlotte st , and it 's very small , but the sushi is so delicious ! you even get hot tea served with your meal when you eat at the restaurant . the staff was very kind and service was great . the prices are extremely decent , as well ! we were the only ones in the restaurant so we received great service ! highly recommend for sushi lovers !
asian	the waiter was so helpful with recommendations and the atmosphere was great . favorite sushi place !
asian	fast and attentive service ! ! ! ! the fish is fresh and the flavor combinations are perfect . definitely one of my favorite sushi joints in vegas .
asian	which makes sense just because it 's all you can eat doesn 't mean to waste food so i completely agree with their rules if you don 't finish something you pay for it .. the only thing limited is the mochi ice cream it 's one per person but if you are with other people that are just going to get ice cream you can get their mochi order ... really enjoyed this place will definitely be eating here again
asian	fast , clean , fresh . friendly staff . favorites are arizona , beauty , alaska , and spicy ninja , although everything here is some of the best around hands down !
asian	wow sushi had great yelp reviews so we tried it last night . this place is reasonable , they were quick , nice and most importantly had amazing fresh sushi . the salmon and tuna was fantastic ! they are losing a star for their seaweed salad that was not so great .
asian	the best green muscles , will make your mouth water . definitely worth the trip . very reasonable in price .
asian	cozy interior and nice staff . they have a great lunch menu until 3pm and 5 % off cash payments too .
asian	good drinks too . they don 't take reservations but have a nice size bar and sushi bar too .
asian	some may say it 's more expensive than other sushi joints , however for the quality you 're getting this really is the best price you will pay for . will definitely come back to this place .
asian	service is very fast as well for takeout ! totally recommend !
asian	the rice to filling ratio in the sushi rolls is perfect . the nigiri is awesome . we were despairing over the lack of really good sushi in phoenix after moving here a couple years ago , and then harumi opened and our lives changed ! juno often comes over to speak with us and we 've been treated to complimentary edamame , rolls , desserts , and sometimes even wine . we feel valued as customers and have truly never had a sub-par experience here . pro tip : try the omakase !
asian	the vibe was laid back located in a repurposed fast food restaurant , don 't let this stop you as you will deny yourself some of the best sushi in town . the entire wait staff was great . super nice people that wanted to be there and gave great recommendations on j 's sushi of choice . the presentation was great and portion of the sushi was more than generous ! looking forward to being back !
asian	fresh ! quaint surroundings that makes an occasion special . if you love sushi , you will definitely love sushi-ya
asian	fresh tasting and creative ! spicy garlic edamame was bomb ! ! ! definitely coming back !
asian	we did not have any disappointing fish . chirashi was the best i have had in nevada . service was fast and friendly . we will be back .
asian	super fresh fish . my favorites are super white tuna sushi and pastel roll . the super white tuna melts in your mouth , for real . i pounded 3 pastel rolls today for lunch. my. god . i just earned my first free meal with their rewards program . i 'll be back soon ! highly recommend this place . ayce ftw .
asian	friendly staff . prices are reasonable and not over priced . surf and turf roll is a must have !
asian	they include sashimi with ayce . top quality fish & very tasty sushi . i 've tried all kinds of food . nigiri , sashimi , sushi rolls , beef short ribs , chicken katsu , mussels ... etc . everything i had there was very very good . i totally recommend it . ask for chase & tell him mickie recommend the place .
asian	if you dine-in , the owner often serves you a dish on the house and take out is always hot , quick service , and 10 % discount ! love the affordable lunch combos too . their teriyakis are my favourite !
asian	get the sushi taco for sure . i was pleasantly surprised that there were two in one order . the staff was very helpful with the tough decision on whether what we ordered was too much sushi or not . great presentation and spice levels were on point !
asian	go in the evening for the happy hour and the owner will dance for the whole restaurant . it is strange , but entertaining .
asian	go now while you can still get in . once word gets around about how good this place is , nobody will be able to get in . it 's definitely in a weird location , but don 't let that deter you . fresh sushi , very creative chefs , and i love the purple / black rice ! ! sit at the sushi bar if you can . i should have written this review the day of so i remembered the names of what we ordered , but i do remember the kodo roll . our server said it was their signature roll and recommended it - loved it ! ! my new favorite sushi spot in arizona !
asian	good quality made to order all you can eat . includes several choice of desserts . they also have a blackboard of specials that you can order as part of the all you can eat . the restaurant is a little small , so it gets crowded quickly . it is definitely worth the drive off of the strip .
asian	good size rolls , 10x better than sushi broker . if i had to make a complaint , it is that they don 't have light japanese beers for sake bombs which isn 't the end of the world . everything is amazing . just go ! you won 't regret it !
asian	friendly staff . john at the sushi bar will take special requests including " how spicy do you want your spicy yellow tail . " a refreshing break from the canned chain sushi experience .
asian	the sushi here is incredibly fresh , clean and tasty ! they use a good ratio of fish to rice for sushi , and the sashimi is amazing. i haven 't been here for a while but thinks it deserves a good review lol ! i only wish they offered all you can eat sushi . i would be willing to pay $ 25-30 for sushi here if it were allyou can eat .
asian	amazing sushi , great deals , and some of the best service / greatest employees and managers i have ever interacted with
asian	amazing sushi great drinks high class people great service and ambiance thanks alex can 't go wrong
asian	only downside is sushi rolls are a bit on the small side , but i 'll let that pass because of how fresh and flavor packed each bite is . it is definitely nice that they don 't try to pack on the rice for the illusion of big rolls either ! between me and my boyfriend , we were able to inhale about 5 rolls and feel satisfied . some of our favorites were the grand canyon , japanese lasagna , and the sun devil ! plus i love how every staff member says hello and goodbye to every guest that walks in and out ! very friendly and accommodating ! definitely my go to for sushi !
asian	decent casual atmosphere .. love the mississippi roll ! ! gratuity tip is automatically added in your bill
asian	black rice menu options are very innovative , healthy , and delicious . highly recommended .
asian	it was fast too ! we had a spicy tuna roll , the tornado roll ( not for those afraid of spice ) and a special roll that used cucumber in place of seaweed . all were fresh and delicious . i would definitely return to to ne .
asian	cool little spot . i recommend the monster sushi roll simply delicious .
asian	great prices . excellent service . after trying many of the sushi place in the henderson area this place has the best quality , service and prices . sushi was priced great and very fresh .
asian	great prices , we got 5 really good rolls for around $ 40 . really impressed , and when we asked for a special roll of the chefs choosing , we got the coolest dragon roll ( see photos for a picture ! ) really nice place , will be returning for sure !
asian	great rolls and very fresh . best in town by far . the staff is very friendly and juno , the owner , will make some great food .
asian	amazing sushi great service amazing tempura rolls such a variety delicious mushi ice cream and open late which is great for nights out with friend highly recommend ! ! ! ! !
asian	great service , even got free sushi to try because it was slow : ) we will be returning ! ! ! we 're previous tokyo lobby fans but are now jc sushi fans : )
asian	great service . or sushi chef , andrew was on point ! everything he prepared was delicious .
asian	great taste and very generous portions . you can tell that all the ingredients are fresh . the staff is also really friendly ! only downside is that it 's a bit pricey , but you get your money 's worth . the mcknight roll and caterpillar roll deserve mentioning : )
asian	had excellent vegas rolls , tuna rolls and great service . vanessa was an awesome server ! the sauce was so good , so so good . we 'll be back for sure .
asian	and it was soooo good . i have tasted sushi from around mississauga , and so far none have the atmosphere as beautiful as this . it 's a great spot that 's very modern looking and has a nice selection of sushi . definately recommend going here !
asian	had the spicy tuna rolls , philadelphia rolls , and gyoza . best sushi i 've had in awhile . service is ok .
asian	i always thought this place only had the community ( cook in front of you ) dinners .
asian	alex was a phenomenal chef . i 'm thinking this is going to be our new favorite spot everything has been so delicious ! ! !
asian	great people and amazing employees . hands down would recommend to any sushi lover
asian	highly recommend had the las vegas and h3 roll and both were delicious
asian	i am very picky about my sushi . the rolls are big and meaty . very well presented . fills you right up and feeling good . i recommend this place highly
asian	you can pretty much get anything you want for lunch it 's only $ 21 and it 's really good food . i like coming for lunch because it 's slower , this place gets pretty busy on the weekends . we like sitting at the sushi bar because you can order faster and the guys are super cool . plus you can get half rolls . i love the house salad and they have an awesome sake martini : )
asian	i don 't particularly care for fish , so having a wide selection of seafood sushi is huge for me . everything always tastes wonderful and we have always had friendly service . our new go to sushi spot !
asian	i had the chirashi platter and it was hands down the best sushi i 've had in recent memory . i will be back .
asian	amazing sushi .. i had the rainbow roll p ; us split the cherry blossom both were awesome : ) can 't wait to go back .
asian	i love this place , had a craving for some good sushi and this was the perfect spot . the guy who served us was chatty and friendly and really looked after us so well . the food was top notch ! if you 're looking for some great sushi in the chandler area at a reasonable price then i highly recommend the sushi room .
asian	sushi in not usually my cup of tea so it has to be great for me to indulge in it ! squid ink is one of the best i 've ever had ! ! cougar roll , tahoe roll , vegas roll , tempura asparagus roll , seaweed salad , and the chicken wings were all amazing ! ! the beignets were a bit hard but still good and hey we didn 't come here for fried dough ! ! i think i will even get some squid ink to go for lunch today ! !
asian	it literally came out in minutes when i ordered off their very advanced ipad ordering system . and let me tell you about the variety , they had so much ! it hit every craving i had .
asian	it really helps that this place is a 3-minute walk from my house . we did the all-you-can-eat . their eel sauce is super sweet like maple syrup . at first , i felt like i was eating sushi at ihop . the taste did get old towards the end , but by then i was incredibly full anyway . the salmon kama is also awesome . i love their unagi ! ! ! ( i love unagi in general , but theirs is exceptionally good ) .
asian	it was so fresh and incredible . this is by far our favourite sushi place !
asian	amazing sushi just awesome .. great food good pricing and excellent service this is the only place i go for sushi
asian	my first time trying sushi , now i am hooked , i will be back !
asian	lasanga roll and heartattack are my favorite ! everything tastes soo fresh !
asian	loved the sauces that you can have with it for dipping . the spicy tuna was spicy and delicious . i would crave this place if l lived here !
asian	loved the two rolls and tuna sashimi . found this place randomly but will be back ! only recommendation is that they play music .
asian	all dishes were amazingly delicious , very friendly service and beautifully restaurant . definitely will come back next time i 'm in vegas ...
asian	the fried rice was a little different from what i 'm used to , but now it 's the only kind i want .
asian	more on the pricey side , but definitely worth it . the restaurant is nice and cozy . the service here is amazing ( think its run by 2 people , and they 're so sweet ) definitely will be back again .
asian	my family ( extended included ) have been coming here for years and it 's never disappointed . the school bus roll and the vegas roll are our favorites . the teppanyaki is always delicious as well . the atmosphere is so fun and is great for casual dining or for a special event . the staff is always very friendly and seem to remember us . always a great time and always leave satisfied .
asian	my favorite menu items are magic carpet , spider roll and tiger roll . great customer service too !
asian	my favorite was the hawaiian but i also loved the tuna tataki roll and mexican fiesta roll . i would definitely come back if i am in vegas again .
asian	nigiri is good size lots of fish . every roll ordered was amazing . this was my first visit and i will be sure to return !
asian	funky atmosphere but amazing food . the fried and steamed dumplings were cooked perfectly and they came with a spicy soy sauce . wednesday is $ 5 martinis too . $ $ / 5 i will be coming back for sure ! ! ! a real gem in kent .
asian	one of the best in phoenix . we have been everywhere and are originally from la . we know good sushi ! ! this is one of three good sushi restaurants in az !
asian	services is very good , orders are fast . sushi looks very good and yummy. https : / / youtu.be / wvmsuptoene
asian	only complaint was on one visit they brought my miso soup out after my rolls ... it 's typically a starter , so i 'm thinking the waiter forgot about it .
asian	party of 4 and we were greeted at the best . great attention from servers . defenetly come back
asian	best sushi i 've had in a while . it much better then any sushi restaurant or buffets i 've been to i think the flavour is great . the price is good too . the presentation is amazing .
asian	my go to restaurant when i 'm craving sushi ! nice atmosphere and friendly servers ! love their lunch specials !
asian	one of the better ones in charlotte , especially for the price . i had the tuna fresh summer rolls and they were awesome ! at only $ 4 per roll , i felt this was a great deal for so much fresh ahi tuna . i got the mango de tango roll and the rich and famous roll , both were delicious ! the specialty rolls were a good size and under $ 10 a roll for the two i got . their drinks also looked unique and sounded great , i will be trying a few of them next time . overall , i had a great experience here and will definitely be back !
asian	really good food , lovely interior decoration . nice service . i will recommend my friend .
asian	i 've only been here for lunch , but their prices are very reasonable for the high quality of sushi you get . their lunch combos come with the same good old miso soup and salad , like other places . however , it 's served in fancier dishes and i love them ! it 's a small place with not a lot of seating , but it 's pretty spaced out and quiet . they also have a small patio that 's probably open in the summer , but i 've never been .
asian	we are from vancouver and has no idea what to expect as our expectations for good sushi is pretty high . excellent food , we shared a variety of rolls , some sashimi as well as a beef teriyaki all was very good . and the staff was very friendly and helpful , none of speak french and our waiter not only got all our order correct , i have some food allergies and he went out of his way to make sure the food my son and mom ordered with my allergy was completely separate from the other food . if you are looking for sushi in this area , highly recommend it .
asian	really delicious . not filled with rice and generous amounts of fish especially in the hand roll . clean and friendly service !
asian	really enjoyed our meal . staff is very friendly and knowledgeable . sushi is very fresh and tasty . wish i could eat here everyday ! ! ! !
asian	good price ! you can order using an ipad which is really cool . you don 't have to leave ur seat and food will be serviced fast and friendly ! i recommended it for anyone who is a sushi enthusiast
asian	the owner is so sweet and friendly . the food was delicious and fresh . coming from san diego , it 's hard to find a decent sushi restaurant but yanagi sushi is a must ! ! ! oh and they serve delicious hawaiian poke !
asian	had the caterpillar roll , tiger roll and something off the menu . the ingredients are very fresh . the homemade spicy sauce has a real kick-never had anything like it before . the owner is super friendly . i would definitely come back to try the rest of the items on the menu . heard the steak and salmon is very popular .
asian	my favorites here are their tempura rolls or unique creations of the sushi chefs ( they have 3 sushi menus ... ) my favorites ? thousand island , ichiban spicy , spicy scallop and supercrunch . these are prepared to perfection and served by their very friendly waitstaff . they know thier nz sushi--ask them anything ! always packed at night , but worth the wait . small dining room with even smaller sushi bar ... but you still get outstanding service .
asian	sat at the bar and he custom made rolls for me based on what i love . so fresh & delish ! it 's right by my house . i go all the time .
asian	all day happy hour makes it super affordable and the portion sizes are very generous ! we 'll definitely be back !
asian	service is amazing ! ! we eat there at least twice every time we 're in vegas . beats any other place in town .
asian	service is on the slow side , but by far the best choice for take out on the south shore . really decent prices .
asian	sit at the bar and ask for charlie . great drinks great sushi . the lobster tacos were amazing . try charlies signature drink 50 blue berry- tini ! ! ! ! !
asian	small joint , mom and pop restaurant . ramen was amazing ! sushi couldn 't be better . we will be back again for sure !
asian	best hamachi kama i 've ever had ! thanks hiro !
asian	so fresh which is not what you expect in the middle of the desert but it 's one of my favorite places in the across he nation . i would say on par with morimoto 's in ny but no ridiculous price ! when i 'm in los angeles , i look forward to going to vegas just for the sushi ( specifically the toro ) here !
asian	some of the best sushi i 've ever had , even including in japan ! very very tasty but still simple and nicely portioned . every mouthful is to be savored ... and we will definitely be back for more : - )
asian	amazing sushi , some of the freshest ever , incredibly friendly staff with great portions , a colleague and i shared a large sushi boat the tuna and butter fish were awesome !
asian	outstanding customer service , great food for a great price . i have been to many sushi places here in town but this is definitely one of the better ones . the owner 's could not be nicer , and really go out of their way for you . i moved about 2 miles from here and come down at least once a week , never disappoints !
asian	friendly staff and happy hour specials last all day ! ! ! does not close in the middle of the day like some sushi restaurants ! buy one get one for $ .99 beers all day ! so many good things to say about this place , i highly recommend it ! : )
asian	best spicy tuna handroll i have ever had ! ! ! !
asian	that spot was a little hard to find at first but once we did we were so happy to be there . my boyfriend and i went for date night here and the service was amazing , along with the sushi and drink specials . highly recommend and definitely listen to your servers suggestions ours did not steer us wrong ! love this place
asian	the all you can eat lunch is very affordable and the food came out quickly .
asian	the best in town , by far . they 're fish is about the freshest you can get in phoenix . my new favorite sushi spot !
asian	it will leave you stunned ! the way imitation fish and meat have been rolled into sushi . the service is great . the portions are pretty decent , a huge variety of food and everything is excellent .
asian	the food came out quick , and it was very fresh . service was fantastic as well !
asian	the gem of downtown . you can definitely taste the freshness of this sushi . you won 't be disappointed by going here !
asian	the nikko roll tastes sublime and has gorgeous presentation . incredible service . worthy of the upscale prices .
asian	the place is pretty small but has a great ambiance about it . reasonably priced sushi an it is presented very well . will definitely come back anytime i am in madison !
asian	there is a limit on some of the more expensive items - but for the ayce price and quality of the fish , it seems totally reasonable . i only had items from the nigiri menu and everything was fresh and delicious . my favorite was probably the mackerel and the uni , but everything was outstanding . the night i was there it was almost full and the dishes still came out pretty quickly -although i was seated at the bar , which helped . if you go for the nigiri , then plan on doing the ayce as it will be cheaper than a la carte , and you 'll want to try everything .
asian	the rolls are incredibly tasty and creative . if you don 't like sushi they have a great menu including steak and other dishes . we always come here when we have guests in town because the food and atmosphere is perfect .
asian	the staff was very very friendly and just awesome , never rude or anything . the decor is lovely and the music was ambient and pleasant and quiet enough for pleasant conversation . absolutely none of the fresh sashimi tasted like freezer fish ( if you have lots of raw fish you know the taste ) and the white tuna was to die for . so silky smooth and savory . an amazing meal and money well spent , if in stouffville again will absolutely return . very very good work guys .
asian	the seating can be a little tight , but the service and the food is well worth it . the all you can eat sushi is about $ 20 . just order about 2-3 rolls and you already have your money 's worth .
asian	the specialty roll options are delicious . very unique choices which we always look for in the rolls . the service is impeccable from drinks all the way to the check . i have not had this type of fantastic service in a very long time . great drink options and attention to detail at this sushi restaurant . definitely coming back !
asian	the sushi pizza was amazing and the okane salad was so delicious ! service was great too !
asian	the yellowtail was especially yummy . it gets a little crowded but you can get a stamp for the associated night club and not have to wait in line . they have an awesome dessert sampler complete with chocolate buddhas and huge fortune cookies . the actual fortune cookies are awesome in and of themselves . a little rated r !
asian	they have blue fin tuna , omg so good , so fresh . happy hour is a must , huge rolls and great prices . i would eat here every day if i could ! don 't take my word for it , go see for yourself . customer service is friendly . i overheard them helping out some first-timers and we 're very attentive to their million questions . they have specialty rolls that are off menu so be sure to ask what is the special of the week or day . what the chuck is amazing , ask for it , won 't be disappointed !
asian	amazing sushi this is a great place the service was impeccable , the food amazing atmosphere was awesome well worth the visit !
asian	truly delicious and affordable . the owner was really really nice , and gave me a nice gift for my birthday while dining . try the sushi combo and japanese lasagna roll !
asian	the best in henderson / las vegas ... the best of the best !
asian	volcano rainbow roll and sashimi are delicious . super fresh and the service is great : )
asian	wait at times was long but worth the wait . they were quite busy when i came in . yellowtail sashimi was delicious . fire in the hole roll with shrimp tempura came out so hot and spicy . mouth watering . so glad we great sushi place in the north valley .
asian	i was seated at the sushi bar , and watching the chefs make it was great fun . service was also spectacular .
asian	we had the $ 80 per person " chef 's choice . " plenty of food for us . eight types of tuna , including an awesome blue fin from spain . presentation was perfect ! the blueberry saki was aged in house , so tasty . not the place to bring " roll " fans , if you want the best fish though , this place is for you .
asian	we had the surfer , damn good and yellowtail in citrus . all were amazing .
asian	we have been coming to this restaurant for several years and they do sushi better than any restaurant in the charlotte area ! the peter pan roll is great and if you want something without rice , the spicy saigon tuna wrap will not disappoint ! ! ! right across from the siskey y !
asian	we normally go to i love sushi . however this place was much cleaner newer and everything was delicious . great service as well ! we have the yellowtail with jalapeños and the dragon fire . saki was really good too . comes in an ice bucket to keep it chilled . and the coolest thing is everyone yells when you leave . makes you feel special . thanks for an amazing evening and dinner ! !
asian	we ordered about 7 rolls and each one was equally amazing ! plan to go back soon ! !
asian	we ordered and had our sushi within 10 minutes or less . the sushi rolls were also 50 % off . i highly recommend this place .
asian	we were shocked at the quality of sushi that we got in this strip mall sushi joint . a must try !
asian	will definitely be frequenting this sushi bar ! really awesome customer service and a nice sample ! love the seared tuna , spicy tuna roll and the sex and the city specialty roll .
asian	we had the christmas roll , pink lady , 2 in 1 , and aso maki specialty rolls . i didn 't like the pink lady based on personal preference but the other three were great . they have a small selection of inexpensive beer , wine , and saki . service was excellent and informative . would highly recommend mizu !
asian	wonderful service , if you want some of the best las vegas , nv ( henderson ) sushi this is a must try ! ! each time we go here , it is never a disappointment . # chefdanny , # amazingg ! !
asian	wonderful service ! only issue is , don 't come super hungry because you will have to wait on a weekend as it is very busy . but it 's only that busy because the sushi is so wonderful and so cheap !
asian	you can 't go wrong ! the black rice is a wonderful touch to the sushi and the artistry that the chef creates with his sushi is as fantastic as it tastes . wow ! definitely going back the next time i 'm in phoenix . you must try it .
asian	you must get reservations because the place is very very small like 8 tables and they will be packed .
asian	you must try the sexy crab . great service . everyone was incredibly nice . fastest sushi i have ever had .
asian	you really can 't go wrong , although the snow mountain roll is by far the best
asian	amazing sushi you will not be disappointed don 't let the look or location of the restaurant fool you !
asian	this place is now on my itinerary . the food tasted amazing and it was so cheap . i am so glad that unlike place in san francisco they don 't nickle and dime you by charging for rice per serving . we ordered hot and spicy tofu , fried chicken cubes with hot pepper and hot and spicy pork kidney . all the dishes were amazing and the waiting staff was super friendly ... as with all the good food places , it 's pretty packed at lunch so plan accordingly .
asian	great price too , $ 5 each which is a steal for such great quality food . make sure to bring cash as they don 't take card although if yu forget there is an atm right across the street . downside is minimal seating and it 's usually packed if you go at lunch time , but definitely worth the wait .
asian	love the green curry ... and you can trust their spice levels . the mango and sticky rice is a must when it 's in season .
asian	had the miku zen , aburi , miku roll , and miso-salted caramel and jasmine tea ice cream !
asian	definitely recommended . my only issue is that the menu was not filling at all . we were still hungry after 9 courses ! the restaurant is very small ( only seats about 25 ) , so be sure to make a reservation !
asian	every roll we ordered was delicious ! each had it 's own unique taste . the oh my god roll is my favorite . service is excellent and the chefs truly know what they are doing .
asian	fresh material . lovely sashimi . yeah , little pricy but nice taste and excellent experience .
asian	my fav chinese restaurant in pittsburgh . we called to order sesonal chicken with fried rice and wonton soup . i love it ! even more than pf chang
asian	amazing tastes ... awesome flavors cowfish is one of my most favorite restaurants in charlotte
asian	amazing taste .. the quality is worth it .. loved the noodles there .. thought have tried only veg till now .. but loved it ... will try non-veg stuff too .. heard a lot about chilli chicken here ...
asian	i had the chicken pad thai with tofu added - it was fried to be exact and very tasty . my girlfriend had biscuit and beef pho and said it was her favorite shes ever had . highly recommend this place if you enjoy either of these dishes .
asian	fresh . artistic food . friendly service . very busy place but worth the waiting ( 10-20 minutes ) for rolls . the reason i did not give 5 stars : the communication between the server and chefs . orders were being missed on tickets due to the high volume of orders . the server and chefs were aware and were constantly checking in on each other to make sure orders were executed appropriately .
asian	the prices were excellent for the portion size . great for any time of day , this soup will put you in a full , healthy mood . superb balance of soup and meats . service was quick , but communication was a stretch . i still would go there everyday if i could !
asian	amazing tasty lamb curries , decent price take out place ..... i highly recommend the palak paneer .
asian	tepan chef david & felix we 're great . soo 's service was spectacular and energetic . she also recommend " the chef special " when ordering tepanyaki , which consists the perfect variation of the menu . upon returning , we hope to run into chef morimoto to congratulate him for successful las vegas launch . domo arigato mr. morimoto : )
asian	amazing teriyaki and pot stickers .. i could go here for lunch every day !
asian	i love it , huge portion and great taste . if there was a little bit more veggies it would be perfect but overall very great place .
asian	hubby got the loco moco & he said it was just as amazing as from when we were in hawaii . their teriyaki sauce was phenomenal , i put it on top of the chicken katsu which was sooo perfectly crispy , they complimented each other so well . can 't wait to come back here .
asian	veg , fruit and herbs are super fresh and delish
asian	don 't miss this little hidden gem ! singapore noodles with chicken is our favorite ! !
asian	dishes are delicious and original , good portions , very easy to share . also make solid cocktails , but be sure to reserve , it 's small 14 seater with an additional 6 bar stools . owners have an amazing story , run by a young couple , husband met his wife in her country of thailand during a vacation . she is the chef and runs the kitchen , he runs the front of house and service # hiddengem # musttrythecashewchicken
asian	after a long trip from houston texas , we decided to stop by for dinner . friendly service and great food , i can 't ask for anything more . i ordered the tum yum noodles soup , love it . my wife and sons ordered the crab and pineapple fried rice dishes , amazing ! !
asian	i love their food so much , and the waitress is always super kind and helpful . a little bit on the pricier side , but they definitely have some of the best-tasting thai food in vegas .
asian	sit at the bar and have chris heflin serve you . fun friendly and a great bartender , oh yah pretty hot too . happy hour special is perfect . try the crispy noodle island wow . linda is by far the best . we love her . thank you for having red thai in the hood
asian	you have to be there right around the time they open for dinner , otherwise the wait can be quite long . try their pad thai and green curry !
asian	can 't go wrong here . but had to wait 45 minutes for a table , which is sayin ' something .. that it 's worth it . red curry was good , pad thai even better . however , should be more generous with the rice when you order the curry .
asian	chicken pad thai is the best ive ever had . great for takeout .
asian	chicken wings were terrific ( and spicy ) and spicy basil chicken off lunch menu was fantastic ! the thai iced tea was some of the best i 've had and the sticky mango rice was incredible ! one of my new favorite go to places for food in vegas . it 's off the strip and probably not the best walking around neighborhood , but the food and decor inside ( as well as the staff ) are awesome !
asian	consistently delicious with great prices ! food has flavour that explodes in your mouth .
asian	cute , small place . everything there is really delicious . love their green curry and garlic entree . the service does get a bit slow , i feel like it 's gotten a little worse lately . they could probably stand to hire another server .
asian	delicious but beware thai spicy is no joke . order green curry thai spicy and found habanero peppers . amazingly good but to spicy
asian	do yourself a favor and start with some tom kha coconut soup ; it is to die for . i ordered my drunken noodles as thai hot and it was spicy , but still held onto its delicious flavor without tasting only of peppers .
asian	i went a little crazy on this order . chicken satay , spring rolls , tom yum shrimp soup , pad thai and spicy basil chicken fried rice . it was all delicious and authentic . flavors and portions were right and delicious . courteous staff and only a 15 min wait for take out . will definitely return
asian	finally ! such a great spot with authentic thai food ! had the panang shrimp curry and the pad kee mao and chicken satay ! everything was delicious ! ! highly recommend !
asian	first time tried coconut soup - absolutely amazing , never had anything like this before !
asian	best thai i have had in town , hands down ! i would suggest trying a little bit of everything , as the appetizers are divine , so try ordering a lot of small plates and sharing !
asian	free thai iced tea with check in ! our server was very attentive and courteous . will be back again .
asian	i had the spring rolls and red curry - medium and it came out perfect ! i can 't wait to go back for seconds .
asian	green curry was unreal. service was quick and friendly and food presentation was also quite nice .
asian	had so many great dishes . really enjoyed the crispy rice , coconut soup , fresh spring rolls , yellow curry , sea bass drunken noodle and pad thai . what really impressed me was what happened when i was leaving . because we were a group of 6 , gratuity was added to my bill . i didn 't notice and added and additional 20 % gratuity . as i was walking out the door , the server ran up to me and showed me gratuity was included . wow ! how is that for integrity ! i will most definitely return to this amazing hidden gem !
asian	also i tried the papaya salad and crab fried rice garlic ademame and curry potatoes dumpling everything was excellent and we will be back .
asian	have been going for over 15 years , must get the tom ka gai soup . my favorite is the rama chicken ( peanut sauce ) , the best ever ! husband loves gang ped !
asian	have been here a number of times . grew up in australia and was spoilt with such excellent thai food ! coming to america is has been hard to find authentic , excellent thai ! but this is amazing ! best thai i have had since moving over here 5 years ago . we ordered a variety of appetizers and mains- every single one knocks dit out of the park ! ! finished with the mango sticky rice and it was superb ! ! cannot wait to go back .
asian	family owned style business with a very cosy atmosphere . they do have a good selection of liquor in the restaurant too . if you feel adventurous , try the tamarind crispy duck with rice , it 's a flavor party in the mouth .
asian	the pad thai was great but not too spicy . try out the green chicken curry , you will not regret it . overall experience was good .
asian	i always order my curry from this place because it 's so good . it 's extremely authentic thai curry . spice level is appropriate , though it 's only 1-5 option . this is just me but i hate curry that is 10 % meat and 90 % veggies . i prefer a good balance . this place knows the balance . the chicken sa-tay with peanut sauce is bomb too . do yourself a favor and get an order of it . just a heads up : it 's located inside baileys sports bar , so don 't be too alarmed if your gps sends you that way .
asian	if you 're a fan of sukhothai , this is a must try ! we ordered squash fritters , green curry and massaman curry . my favourite was the massaman curry , though , very very hot ! be watchful that curry creeps on you ! nonetheless , absolutely delicious ! the beef was so tender and juicy and the curry was full of flavor ! loved the ambiance , a little underground , hip spot . portions are good and each dish is around $ 15 . can 't wait to go back there ! oh , and be ready to wait 45 minutes to an hour if you go during the evening time or weekends !
asian	i have tried thai food in so may cities and so many countries . this one is the bessttt .. everything in their menu is just delicious. their pad thai and pad gra prow are my favourite . papaya salad is great too . they are renovating but i still don 't miss a chance of going to nana and have khao san . yes its always super busy but its definitely worth the wait ..
asian	i love a good curry and this place beats them all ! the pineapple duck curry is one of their best , along with the red curry . their pad thai is also phenomenal . and the thai tea ... oh , the thai tea ! i can 't wait to come back !
asian	yea the parking can be a bit tight but don 't let that stop you . i have not tried the lunch menu but i want to soon , as it starts at $ 5.00 and the lunch soup starts at 3.50 . the menu is very very well priced , the lady cook is phenomenal . every dish we have tried is incredible ! we try to come here as much as we can . the couple that run this restaurant are very sweet and have known my boyfriend for ten years . please visit , enjoy and tip well !
asian	love the décor and the food is super yummy .. i want more ! ! : )
asian	i ordered chicken parang , my go-to thai dish when traveling . i like it best without basil . their curry sauce was rich and creamy--not soupy like most thai restaurants in south florida . it was so good i had to come back for more the very next day . it took a while for my food to be ready , but it was well worth the wait .
asian	it 's my top 5 in the gta . it all tastes really fresh and simple . the dishes are elegant without being over the top . the food is consistent every time i want a good meal . i love their soups . it 's spicy and savoury . my mouth waters just thinking about it .
asian	i 've eaten here at least a dozen times and the food is consistently great . great service and reasonably priced . this is one of my new favorites !
asian	off the strip , but well worth the uber / taxi ride . they were able to accommodate our large group and food requests . make reservations !
asian	lotus of siam made the best pad thai i 've had my entire life . the flavors were incredible , and the noodles were perfect . i can 't go back to another thai restaurant and expect the same from them anymore . the only thing is , they do get very busy ( because they 're well known ) , but trust me . it is so worth the wait ! ! you know i 'll be coming back . it 's a shame how far i live from them !
asian	the owner was very gracious and open to variations depending on diet . great food , fresh and perfectly seasoned .
asian	everything is perfect , price are very good , top quality ! it 's a must go place ! a + we will comeback for sure !
asian	so far the best one i tried in toronto . khao soi chicken is my favorite dish . tom yum soup is one the best ... make sure to try it .
asian	specialized spicy flavor depending on what you like . great service and they put on the ncaa tourney for us . spicy wings were also straight fantastic .
asian	the parking lot can get a bit hectic at times but the restaurant is clean and trendy . i had the satay and pad see ew , both delicious . definitely worth trying if you are in the neighbourhood .
asian	the area around the restaurant looked a bit deserted and i was skeptical to go inside the small door . but as soon as i entered my whole perception changed . the restaurant smelled amazing and the ambience was really good . one tip : if going for dinner please expect at least an hour 's wait .
asian	the location is a little suspect but once inside the restaurant is nice . i recommend the prawns and crispy rice . i can 't wait to go back to try more dishes .
asian	the pad thai is excellent and the kao soi was really good as well . the atmosphere is great and the service was good . went there saturday night and the wait time was short . if you like khao san road , you 're going to love this one ! ! !
asian	this place is legit ! it has become super popular so the wait is a little long so usually i go a bit earlier and they text you when the table is ready . the food is amazing ! we had the squash fritters and spring rolls to share . i had the green curry in a coconut ... wow ! the coconut inside is amazing , don 't forget to eat that part ! the staff are super friendly . the thai ice tea is one of the best i have ever tasted ( including in thailand ) can 't wait to go back !
asian	) , very pretty decor , and no wait time ! this beats lotus of siam any day in my book . the soup bowls come with a mini heater to keep them sizzling , delicious , and near and dear to my heart .
asian	will definitely be going regularly . the food is priced right . will 100 % recommend the place for authentic thai food .
asian	you must try the crab ragoons , thai iced tea , seafood soup ( best soup you 'll ever have ) and the spicy basil with beef ! the sushi is excellent also ! if you haven 't tried thai food you must go here . you will fall in love . amazing quality and great service . super cute atmosphere !
asian	i will be back soon ! i had the duck noodle soup and it was fabulous . our service was wonderful , the spice station is as advertised ... hot ! also enjoyed the shrimp rolls to appetize my pallet before the duck rodeo . the menu is what you would expect from thai but also included some chinese items such as orange chicken . overall , this place excelled . i give it 5 stars for consistency and quality . i 've been here over a dozen times and every entree thai item is spot on .
asian	love all the dessert , earthquake is a must ! ! ! and vanilla bean creme brûlée is so beautiful . also the service is very nice and friendly . our waitress is apple , she so nice and give us a good recommendations .
asian	ignore where it 's located and enjoy the food ! dining room is nice , odd set up ... you have to walk through dry storage to get to the giant bathroom but you could also see the employees cleaning and wiping the silverware piece by piece . so yummy .. next we are trying the soup that comes out with a flame ! ! !
asian	the tom kha soup and " cheese rolls " appetizers were to die for ! masaman curry simply wonderful ! can 't wait to eat here again ( and we haven 't even left yet ) !
asian	when i 'm in newmarket this is one of my favorite thai restaurants i have to come to .. ( come to think of it .. if not ' thee ' only one ; ) ) . cozy hidden gem .. it is on the small casual side of dining .. nothing fancy .
asian	one of the best we have had . glad we found this place before we left town . we had the pad thai and drunken noodles .
asian	ordered takeout on a monday night , and it was ready in 10 minutes . my boyfriend and i had the summer rolls , crab rangoon ( awesome ! ! ! ) , crazy noodles and pad thai . will defiantly be going back soon .
asian	loved the food and the service . food is great staffs are super friendly service is good prices are reasonable
asian	if you know jitlada thai restaurant in los angeles then you have to try this place out . joe and his staff were great and attentive . their food was amazing 5 star quality and fresh . we tried this tom yum soup , coconut salad , pork ribs and pineapple fried rice . definitely coming back again to order some more
asian	it 's by far the best panang curry and pad thai in a long time !
asian	my fave dish is the pad kee mao . this place definitely rivals khao san road in my opinion - but take out is the way to go because it 's not much of an eat-in place !
asian	i would eat here again . i had the dumpling special & salmon special . a colleague recommended this place & i am recommending it to others : -d
asian	always thought it was difficult to go downtown for good thai food and thankfully now i won 't have to . large servings , great ambiance and even better servers . it 's a family owned restaurant and the staff really makes you feel welcome . the green curry is delicious and very spicy . i personally enjoyed it more than the ones i 've tried in downtown toronto . also , the snapper is a delight to have , soft on the inside and a very crispy crust . i plan on going there again . make a reservation because it was packed at 8 : 30pm on a friday night
asian	don 't be discouraged by the creepy strip mall , this place is always packed !
asian	thai tea is my favorite , and i always come here to get it . my boyfriend and i always get to go and it 's super quick , and delicious every time !
asian	they were very accommodating to me as a vegan . i was able to order thai tea with coconut milk . i ordered some tofu and veggies dish . outstanding service .
asian	they have a salad and soup buffet that comes with the lunch special . the peanut dressing for the salad is really really good . i got the pad sew ew and it 's the best i have had in the valley . fast and friendly service . i just started working in the area and this will be my go to for thai at least once a week .
asian	thank you leslie for a wonderful night , i will definitely be back the next time i 'm in town ! the sushi was so fresh and delicious , there wasn 't one roll i didn 't like ! the crispy brussel sprouts are to die for , you must try them ! ! i almost forgot about the cocktails , they are handcrafted and sooo tasty . i recommend the melon and mezcal smokey and sweet and delicious !
asian	try the low carb soy noodles in your italian dish . good stuff .
asian	service was a little slow . i think they may have been short handed . i would definitely go back . my brother said it is the best thai food he has ever had .
asian	that is all , amazing food , excellent service . we stopped in for a quick lunch and we 're pleasantly surprised . we started out with the calimari appetizer which was amazingly seasoned . i had the teriyaki salmon bento box and the flavors were outstanding . my son had the ramen and my husband had the oxtail soup and were both happy and full .
asian	that 's all i can say .... definitely coming back to try more menu items . waited a little bit for food but sooo worth the wait . we had the drunken noodles with tofu and panang curry with pork .... and they are very nice too : - )
asian	that 's all i can say . i tried a lot of different dishes and everything was better than the last ! i 'm craving it as we speak : ) can 't wait to come back !
asian	that 's all . oh , try the love roll , bulgogi , spicy chicken , spicy salmon roll and sushi pizza ! you 're welcome .
asian	the # 32 - kelly d is amazing . absolutely to die for . also dont forget the # 79 monkey special with eel sauce and a deep fried banana ! best sushi in vegas
asian	the absolute best ramen i 've ever had in the states . the place is immaculate , service well executed , and the ramen is incredibly fresh and delicious . highly recommend for the best ramen experience in lv !
asian	the atmosphere is quaint , everyone is so friendly , and the food is incredible ( and affordable ) . i 've tried several things on their menu and they 're always delicious -- though i 'm partial to the spring rolls . they also do delivery , which is pretty quick . highly recommended !
asian	the beef bulgogi was delicious . honestly everything looked amazing and i can 't wait to go back !
asian	their food is always consistent , friendly staff as well ! i have a love-hate relationship with them , love their food , hate because i 'm trying to diet ! go there !
asian	the best green curry i 've had and i have tried at least 12 other places across pa / nj / nc / ga etc ... prices are average but taste is superb ! we have tried many of their other dishes there as well and all have held the same great standard . we now take friends and family there for any special occasion .
asian	the best poke in town . fresh , clean and super friendly services. highly recommended . definitely be back .
asian	the best ramon ... full of flavor ! perfect noodles ! ! i got spicy pork and you can choose your spice level .. and they nailed it ! ! ! the gyoza was the best we have ever had state side . great service ! ! fun atmosphere . not enough good can be said ! we will be back again and again . this is the ramon shop we have been searching for ! yummmmmmmm ! ! !
asian	the best sauce , if you like sweet or flavorful sauce this is your sauce . the servers were extremely kind and helpful , when i needed an adjustment to something , they took it like it was nothing ! also , my son accidentally spilled his drink and they were so nice about it . they just said no problem , and cleaned it right up . i would come here forever , they are the best !
asian	the best service and food in the area ... if you live in north las vegas area and dont want to drive to spring mountain to eat korean food then this should be your place . my wife and daughter and i always try to eat here once a week . from the stone pot bim bin bop to the basic teriyaki bowl its all delicious ... the juns special is for you hungry hungry people who want the best on one plate . the sides are very freshly made and the selection although small menu is still enough to have the korean basics for you to choose from including the spicy tofu soup ! ! !
asian	fish is so fresh and filling ! the rolls are filled with tons of fish and not as much rice as other sushi places
asian	the best sushi in vegas ! ! nobu in hardrock used to be my fav , but i def have to say mizumi is now my favorite . my boyfriend and i were just passing by and decided to try it , we had such an amazing experience from the food to the service to the amazing creme brule ! ! a must go when in vegas .
asian	amazing , the broth was delicious and that little pickled something was amazing .... order the shiro ramen if you are confused ... so so good
asian	the butterscotch pork with wasabi mashed potatoes were the best thing i have eaten in a long time ! the a wild ginger chicken was great especially with their simple fried rice . crab rangoon for appetizer were super tasty , ask for the spicy garlic dipping sauce . highly recommend the ice cream ( moshi ? ) chocolate and strawberry and not too filling at all . even when you are stuffed , order the ice cream ! ! ! simple , clean atmosphere and great staff . we be coming back very soon and often ! ! ! !
asian	the chefs are wonderful and the food is incredible ! definitely coming back every time we come to vegas !

asian	the curry is delicious and the garlic shrimp and crispy duck . due to the wait being 2 hours long we had to order it to go and ate in our car . i can 't wait to go back and actually eat inside .
asian	subarashii but i do have to admit that broth was a little bit on the thicker side but still very delicious ! ! ! !
asian	the decor is reminiscent to alice in wonderland because of the big , amazing garden themed buffet . food is great , prices are not soo much . here , u will feel bad if u dont eat til ur tummy pops out . + decor + food + quality of food + diversity in desserts - price
asian	the end . all of it and the bubble tea ! i got drunken noodles with chicken and a green tea blended drink and all of it was literally perfect .
asian	big thumbs up on the service and food . quick and good price also . coming back .
asian	this place burned down and just reopened so we went in for a try. the salmon and tuna sashimi was very good. it had just the right amount of fat on it. they have a lot of unconventional types of sushi we tried the sushi pizza it was little bits a sashimi over a tempura rice. very good .
asian	the firecracker shrimp and garlic noodles changed my life ! ! ! the sangria was so refreshing and tasty .... i wish i would have found this place sooner . everyone was so nice and the good was very fresh and delicious .
asian	the fish is so fresh and the sushi chefs will make anything custom . i will definitely come back .
asian	the fish to rice portion and quick of service is all it took to win me over . but most of all the quality of the fish / seafood is is superior ! definitely the finest sushi place i 've been to !
asian	the fish was great ! highly recommend the sirachi ( spelling ? ) sauce ! i will be back next time i 'm here in vegas !
asian	the fish was super fresh their wine selection in really great and the service is friendly and caring . one little girl was acting up and one of the waiters gave her mom a chi-chew candy to make her happy super nicely ( making sure to ask the mom before letting the girl see it , in case she wasn 't allowed to have it .
asian	the food here is so so good . we were visiting toronto with our 3.5 year old and new baby . we had ate at guu in vancouver and my husband did a quick search to find this location . we ordered a ton of food , and it was all delicious . even my 3.5 year old loved most of the dishes that we ordered . this location is much larger than the vancouver location , so we lucked out and got a table that we could have the stroller right next to us . we ordered a ton of dishes and each was cooked perfectly and tasty . it was a great experience !
asian	the food here was anything that you would ask for . the taste was right on point and very flavorful . the aburi that we ordered was very tasty and the sauce blended right in . the ambience was very inviting , warm and perfect for a date night . i would definitely recommend this place !
asian	the food is absolutely amazing ! best dumplings i 've ever had ! i haven 't tried anything i haven 't liked , and they will cook it to your liking ! and seriously , deep fried bananas ? ! also , unlike most chinese take out places , it won 't mess with your stomach as soon as you 're done eating ! ! garlic shrimp is the best thing ever ! ! ! !
asian	the food is delicious ! we have been twice now and have been very impressed with everything we have ordered . i love that they have brussel sprouts to add to the ramen- so good ! the broth is flavorful and they have tons of stuff you can add . to top it all off , the customer service is wonderful ! our waiter was hitoshi and he blew our minds with how friendly , professional and attentive he was . we will definitely be back again and again . huge thank you to toshi ! you made our night : )
asian	the food is fabulous ! the chicken wings and short rib fried rice are game changers .
asian	the food is great for the price and the servers are always available to take away your dirty plate or refill your water .
asian	the price is a bit expensive and service too often off or wonky , the restaurant is generally too cold or too hot-- whatever is less desirable . i drive from the triangle to come here , i adore this restaurant more than almost any other one i have been to . i often wish they expanded the menu or did more specials and warm dishes
asian	the food is just top notch . the best thai in the valley ! when i lived in manhattan , i trecked to queens for good thai . this place is just good ! it is super tiny . as other reviewers note , the atmosphere isn 't fancy . but come for the food !
asian	the food is outstanding . the service is even better . the women here are incredibly sweet , and very attentive . if you 're unsure how to cook the fook at your table they 'll do it for you . all you can eat bulgogi , and the amazing pork belly is best served with a bottle of sojo . the only real complaint i have is the price . the all you can eat for $ 22 only lasts an hour so you really have to power through . and the sojo is $ 15 , but it 's the same all around vegas .
asian	the food is so good , very reasonably priced and very child friendly . we ordered pan vege fried dumplings ( tasted house made ) , 2 orders of miso soup , spicy teriyaki beef noodle bowl and spicy thai beef noodle bowl it was only $ 26.84 ! ! service was good , food amazing ! we will definitely be going back . the menu is clean and easy to look through , all dishes have vege , chicken , beef and shrimp options . what we both ordered was distinctly different and we loved them equally .
asian	the food is to die for and their service is always on point . their teriyaki bowls are a great lunch option !
asian	the food is unreal . i have a gluten allergy that can make things difficult . the waiter knew right away what to show me that was gl. the curry was unreal . the wine list was excellent . there were so many bottles to choose from and the prices were great . the is a hidden gem away from the strip .
asian	the food was absolutely delicious , the atmosphere was fun and friendly , and the service was great . i can 't wait to go back . the most authentic japanese restaurant i 've been to in toronto ! ! kudos to koji !
asian	the food was great but the service was even better . i just found my new favorite spot . me and pho mailan have just became friends .
asian	the food was great ! ! our waitress however didn 't know the answer to any question we had and instead of trying to find the answer , just kind of shook it off . great sushi joint though ! definitely worth going . we didn 't sit on the hibachi side so will definitely try that next time . we also had mixed drinks from the bar that were pretty good . worth eating here for sure !
asian	the food was great , service was great .... but the green tea waffle , now that was on a completely different level . can 't wait to come back and i haven 't left yet .
asian	the fried pork is an orgasm in your mouth ! ! ! ! ! ! everything is wonderful , i haven 't had this good of flilpino food since a friend ! ! you must go here
asian	the fried rice might be better than the ramen ... no , not better . as good as the ramen . there 's a wait every time you go , but it 's never long and well worth it . do yourself a favor and run to this restaurant . you 'll be an instant ramen fan .
asian	portions were family sized and the spicy soup was great . very clean and quiet .
asian	the hostess / server was wonderful and so kind . food is excellent and a bit addicting .
asian	the hot bowl is the way to go . do not hesitate to get the black rice- it 's wonderful . we traveled a half hour to get here and it was totally worth it . fresh , healthy , delicious and fast . possibly the best meal we have had in vegas . and last night we spent $ 200 at mr chow ! this is totally amazing food . you must try it .
asian	their food was so good . the crab cheese ragoons were so fresh and delicious . pad thai and short rib fried rice was tasty . great service and amazing food . a must stop . totally worth the wait .
asian	their honey tofu is heaven ! ! ! ! ! i am an avid tofu eater and its beyond amazing
asian	i went with a friend who lives over that way . the owners were so nice and friendly . i cant believe i am just finding this place . the underground menu is now public ... i thought that was kind of cool tho , what i heard of it . only con , the waitress was a little slow , but she was nice and they were busy ... so i will give her that : )
asian	the japanese waygu beef was completely .... and totally ... out of this world . spicy tuna / scallop rolls are also as enticing . i 've had many-a-sushi , this places was certainly of the best . wonderful service , wonderful atmosphere . it 's super bowl weekend and everyone was ready to party ... great for large groups . upscale restaurant , but in no way stuffy ! love !
asian	the le thai noodles ... why i even questioned them , i have no clue . they were excellent . a must try ! tom kha was tasty and full of yummy things and i mean full - no skimping here . delicious . pad thai was perfection . great wait staff and charming atmosphere .
asian	the mackerel was to die for and the tar tar yellowtail was absolutely divine . fabulous dinner with my new friend , bill . thanks for the surprise ! : d
asian	the only thing i could possibly complain about is they don 't deliver , but it 's worth going and picking it up .
asian	the owner and staff is so helpful and knowledgable . they made recommendations for our party of 6 when it was our first time in . everything from appetizers to soup to cocktails to entrees was delicious . i substituted and got the garlic noodles instead of the rice that was supposed to come with my meal . garlic noodle heaven . since then i have been back several times . my favorite it the filet mignonette and shrimp with garlic noodles . surprise needs more places like this . small . well priced . great food . different from anything else around .
asian	the pad thai is so great with peanut and rican sauce . ginger dressing on salad is perfect . made a good choice for lunch today and will 100 % be back soon ! ! ! customer service was very friendly and helpful , which always adds bonus points .
asian	the place is small but very trendy and cute , and i love their music choice . there was quite a wait for our food , but once it came it was delicious . they so not lie ; what the heck sushi roll is fantastic but also very spicy . we also had their teriyaki chicken entree , they put some seaweed on the rice which looked and tasted great .
asian	the ramen mac n cheese is a bit overrated but i 'm still glad i tried it . next time i go i 'm just getting a bunch of wings because those were the best i 'd ever had !
asian	the ramen was delicious . i got the spicy chicken ramen with dumplings and extra noodles . the broth was flavorful.best ramen in vegas.great atmosphere . decent prices . a must try .
asian	there are no other words . it 's so good ! i wish this existed in my city . i will definitely be back for more the next time i 'm in toronto . we tried the red bean paste taiyaki which is purely fantastic . sweet and tasty . we also tried the custard one for the first time and we were pleasantly surprised . i thought nothing would compare to the red bean paste but custard is definitely way up there on the delicious scale . as i 'm typing this , my mouth is watering for more .
asian	obviously this person has no taste ... my soft shell crab sandwich and tofu tots were fantastic . i 'm already craving a second sandwich . will definitely return for dinner .
asian	amazing. the sea bass with miso and raw shrimp tempura were quite delectable. the only thing i kinda found sketchy about this place were the images on the projectors and tv .. great place overall though .
asian	the service can be a tad slow but it is so worth the wait . order a glass of wine and go through some appetizers . we ordered the potstickers and crab puffs and they were really tasty and a nice intro to the meal . the citrus chicken and garlic scallops were unreal . great flavor and texture- obvious that the food is fresh . george chatted with is as we sat at the bar and gave us other recommendations for restaurants . can 't wait to come back .
asian	the service was very fast and the food is to die for , the portion sizes are very generous . try the pork belly steamed buns ! !
asian	the staff is always very accommodating ! ! ! i am a very picky customer as well ! ! i always get the well done and rare pho and a shaking beef for my boyfriend . i brought my family in a few months ago ... all of my family members are pho enthusiast from los angeles mind you ! they thoroughly enjoyed the food . it 's not greasy and packs a flavorful punch ! this is my favorite pho spot in las vegas ! ! ! ! !
asian	the staffs during lunch time was awesome ! i enjoyed eating here this time . the quality of the food was great ! fresh and delicious .. ! definitely recommend this place ! clean store and serves fast server woo was awesome ! only downside was the location , not much parking and its always full , but other than that its really yum yum ..
asian	the sushi chef is one of the originals in town . he used to own teru . he trained in japan . when you eat the sushi it stays together and the rice doesn 't fall apart . no ayce here . just super great quality sushi at a great price by a true master .
asian	the sushi was fresh and extremely savory . i had about 8 different rolls during lunch , some nigiri , some sashimi , and the calamari special . yeah , i ate too much but it was worth it . the hurricane roll was by far my favorite . the service was great , the ambience was great , and i liked that it was away from the strip .
asian	the waiter and chef were so patient with my extremely strict diet ! no soy , dairy , or gluten and they handled it amazing . they helped me make choices and cooked my food first before he slathered everything with butter . my food was cooked to perfection and in line with my dietary restrictions . carlos was so nice and patient while cooking for me and still had personality ! i really appreciate the personal attention from waiter and chef and our whole family had a delicious meal ! would definitely recommend and come back !
asian	they always make a sista feel at home ! spicy albacore out of this world !
asian	they have lunch specials everyday , not just m-f . the sunshine roll is pure heaven , in fact , i can 't stop thinking about it . the sushi is super fresh and beautifully presented . cute place , great sushi , awesome service , i 'm totally hooked !
asian	they make the noodles and dumplings fresh right in front of you . prices are fair and everything we had was delicious . good for vegetarians and pescatarians .
asian	they really know how to cook tofu ! the food is very flavorful and the restaurant decor is cool , fern on a wall piece !
asian	this boring american white chic loves her japanese food and this is the real deal ! honey toast is a must ! !
asian	this has become my fav sushi in the valley . the fish quality is second to none and the rolls are well prepared . add to that the fact that the owner is so accomidating ( six buck bottles of top shelf sake , free miso and edamame , as well as other freebees ) make this place a must go to . the decor leaves a bit to be desited , but with prices and quality this good , who cares ?
asian	this has to be the coolest sushi joint i 've ever been too . the sushi was so fresh and delicious . the atmosphere was so hyped up thanks to the all the servers . a perfect spot to go to at the park . they have a good selection of sushis and sake . i wish we had a spot like this in la .
asian	this is a hidden gem . the restaurant is small and can get quite busy . best to call ahead and make a reservation ! the prices are a tad higher than other places but it is worth every nickel ( penny ) ! food was fresh and the salmon sashimi melted in your mouth . service was good , food arrived fairly quickly .
asian	this is definitely my new favorite korean restaurant . the music , atmosphere , and decor is beautiful and calming . all the food is aesthetically pleasing and yummy . i got the corn cheese , tofu soup , and the cheese chicken ; all were amazing , especially the cheese dishes . the servers , jayden and joy are polite and friendly , always readily serving us . the side dishes were also delicious , better than the other korean restaurants in my opinion . i definitely recommend this place ! ! !
asian	this is my families to go place for all special days . mother 's day , father 's day , even my 6 year old requests this place for her birthday . food always good one of my favorites is the monkey roll you gotta try it . and the green tea ice cream is yummy . service is always great , we always sit at the bar , last time we went we had mj he was is a great chef . really recommend it . fresh fish and great prices .
asian	this is my second time here , every time i order a new plate i am amazed . the servers treat us so nicely and the food is top notch !
asian	the service was top notch . and carry out is available but not easy with the parking . the food is top notch ... made with love ! i have never got a dish i didn 't like ! ! !
asian	this is our new favourite spot . best to come here at off peak times so u can get a seat . the food is made fresh to order and is served by the sweetest owners . they really care that you enjoy the food . i cannot wait to go back . the jalapeño and cheese waffle is the best . chicken is tender and crispy ... lots of sauce options too .
asian	this is probably my favorite restaurant in charlotte . i 've gone now many times , and i 've never been disappointed . they are very consistent , and i 've never not liked anything i 've tried here . the food is very flavorful , and very affordable . i recommend their herbal lemonade , and covering everything in their yellow sauce . i could drink that stuff .
asian	this is the best food for the money in charlotte hands down . my girlfriend goes to uncc and i make sure to eat here evertime i visit . you wont find anything better for under $ 10 .... anywhere
asian	this is the best indian food i 've had . the chili chicken was tender and perfectly seasoned . chana masala was spicy and comforting . basmati with peas was fresh and light . i come here for work occasionally and i will definitely have to eat this food every time i return ! ! very friendly service as well .
asian	this is the place you take people to show off your japanese knowledge of food . the sashimi is perfectly prepared . tried the makeral , octopus and sea bass . great atmosphere and drink specials . i tried the sake . they have a comprehensive list for beginners to understand .
asian	this is the real asian food : ) absolutely delicious in my opinion . great family owned and run restaurant . the orange chicken is like nothing else around , sauce is so flavorful and made from real ingredients . pho is awesome , hong kong won ton soup is a must try as well .
asian	i love korean bbq and i was amazed to see that they came up with this fusion concept to have taco 's with korean bbq . and the price was cherry on the top ...
asian	this place has the freshest tuna tataki i 've ever had . all of their appetizers i had and all the roles we ordered tasted amazing and fresh . this is probably the only time i can say i don 't have a picture to post specifically cause i ate my food too fast
asian	this place has the real stuff . from regular dishes to sushi sashimi , everything tasted so good . only thing i can think of that can improve is having more sashimi selection and warm crab legs instead of cold . other than that , it 's prefect . definite 4.8
asian	this place is awesome . it 's a mix off japanese and italian and it 's everything great about both mixed . i haven 't been disappointed on any of the entrees i 've ordered . appetizers were delicious too .
asian	this place is awesome ! ! the service was phenomenal , the food was incredible ! our waiter was so helpful picking out some amazing dishes for us . totally coming back soon ! !
asian	we left 10 % tips even though there 's almost no service at all . but ! ! ! ! ! the lady server run after us out of the door for more tips ! ! ! ! it 's the first time happened to me . so shocked ! ! ! would never go back there again . sorry for them .
asian	went during the evening for tea. there were only 4 tables seated but it still took me and boyfriend 15 mins to order our food . hated the music . i prefer the destiny on midland .
asian	we ordered a dim sum and it tastes sour . we asked to cancel the order and would not like a new one . we will not want another one because it may make from the same batch . the server refused and said they cannot cancel the order . the manager gave us ugly look and stood beside us for so long and keep suggesting other dim sum for us . we just don 't understand why cant we just cancel it . why do we have to order something else .
asian	her attitude was so bad and seems like to ignore us . definitely not go back anymore ! ! food are not tasty as well , portion are super small , i can say their cutting skills are very good . the luncheon meat thin like a paper ! !
asian	we were two of four people in the restaurant and they took fifteen minutes just to serve us drinks . it took almost an hour to get our food ! the food was not good ! extremely salty and the chicken tasted like it was the pre-cooked stuff you get at a grocery store . also , expensive for the portion you get . will never go back .
asian	when i walked in , i had to wait for 10 mins until someone came to seat us . the food was good . after we finished eating , the waiter brought the bill , then he was standing there with the machine waiting for us to pay . we were just taking our time but he was very pushy . then 5 minutes after we paid , he came to the table and said that we had to leave because other people want to sit in a booth and there is no other booths available .. this is very unprofessional , to be kicked out of a restaurant what kind of service is this
asian	bad service ..... when we came in the resto ... not busy .... but we waited too long for order ... the waiter looks like very busy ..... he don 't know how to do the job .... we asked him to take the order .. he ask us to wait for two mins ..... and he is training with another new waitress ..... and when the other customer coming ... he let the people waited too long ...... just don 't give the seat to them ..... so stupid waiter ...... the food here is not that good like everybody talking about .... just soso .... and expensive .....
asian	wor wonton soup blah , dim sum pork ribs ay and shanghai noodles with pork never again . do not eat here . it was so bad i had to say .
asian	bad staff and the food is not clean and i 'm not happy and you wait to much for delivery
asian	uneven , and unflavorful rolls . all you can eat does not mean all you can eat , beware you will walk away with extra charges .
asian	everything is overpriced for the poor quality fish . avoid this place , or just order the kung pao chicken . you can never go wrong with that . but at this price , you 'd be better off at panda express .
asian	we got kalbi beef was super stale and nasty . bad place . i wouldn 't recommend - take elsewhere
asian	bad sushi , inconsistent and often arrogant wait staff , pass .
asian	not only bad , it was also expensive at $ 100 pre tax for 2 for lunch without drinks . didn 't eat 1 / 2 of what was served . some dishes were okay but most were weird and the uni dishes were really bad and foul tasting .
asian	we ordered to go and the presentation was exactly like the prepackaged rolls @ harris teeter . the rolls were horrible and small especially for the price ! ! never going back .
asian	less than 10 miles from the restaurant and attempted consuming immediately . did not stay down long . it smelled fishy when i took the lid off , i should have stopped then .
asian	pad thai very sticky , very soft noodles and very bland . egg rolls fell apart as soon as i dipped in the sauce , but the sauce very good . i 'm not sure about the décor ... black chairs , black table cloth , candles ? ? ? better off just to go to reign of thai on thunderbird and cave creek .
asian	we ordered a few complicated dishes including some hot noodles , the food were ready almost immediately , they were not fresh cooked at all .
asian	bad taste , salty .. expensive .. special appetizer : chicken lettuce wrap $ 10.25 horrible ... ridiculous do yourself a favor go to pho so 1 you will be happier ...
asian	bad tasting food ... the waiter demanded i give him a better tip .. disregarded our special request quoting rush .. cocktails are not up to the mark ... would skip it if i was u ..
asian	there letting in too much people no one can move properly . too freakin cramped ! please don 't let people buy ticket for a packed day if its already too full . gg
asian	-didn 't refund the hair salad at the end need to be reminded -careless rice come with white plastic chip ( see photo ) -poor personal hygiene come with hair ( see picture ) -bad service not even a singe sorry about the hair . -the meat in the bun textured like sand -cost 40 $ per person good : -clean reno good lighting not worth going at all beware
asian	bad try for this restaurant , no service still cost me 10 percent tips and food there was not from xin jiang in china , really not good , but really expensive , i wont go there anymore , plz trust me , i dont know why this restaurant still exist , ?
asian	did cost twice as much as other pho places in town and isn 't half as good . in a vacuum , it 's ok . but i just cannot recommend this place considering the competition such as saigon pho or even pho chandler
asian	only one person waiting tables but he was very effective and quick . food was good but not the best . could have more kimchi .
asian	went to this place for dinner on a sunday night . i felt pretty comfortable when i saw how crowded it was inside . it doesn 't look like much on the outside . the sushi tasted pretty good , and it was cheap . one of my dining partners and i both suffered the next day though . i felt like crud . i don 't know what it was that got me but i suggest you run , don 't walk , away . i should have known that cheap sushi is generally ( not always ) cheap for a reason .
asian	when they said half an hour wait . sat down and ordered oolong tea and they gave us warmed tea . so they said they are still boiling the water .... waited 30mins then asked for sugar waited another 30mins ... the waitress was very rude ! ! ! ! ! then the gratuity is already included ? for 4people , 1toddler and a baby ? and cooked our own food ? ... when it was really really bad service ! we couldn 't find anybody to help us . never ever coming back here again or will recommend this place !
asian	overly sweet rolls . good french fries ( huh ? at a sushi place ? ) overpriced drinks . at least the company was good . go across the street to the persian room .
asian	we ordered duck soup and were served chicken soup . when questioned the waiter answered : ' they put chicken instead of duck because chicken is tastier than duck ' . the rest of the dishes were over greasy and salty . will not go back .
asian	usually you could get a free drink when you ordered a rice / udon ( lunch time ) , but then the cashier would charge you the regular price of the meal + bubble tea .. ( so you gotta ask for the drink if it 's included ) ... one more thing , i have no idea why they would charge an 15 % tax ( should be 11.3 % ? ) after their recent renovation zz
asian	will never come back . service was horrible . had to ask for refills and chopstick to eat . food not great . dessert awesome . but we are here to eat dinner , not dessert .
asian	you would think a brand new restaurant would have fresh fish but sadly no . expensive , bad fish , and poor preparation . ate a few pieces of my meal and threw the rest away because it was horrible . avoid this place . updated note a few hours after eating at this place . both myself and the person i ate feel sick . food poisoning . do not eat here !
asian	( they must have a lot of friends . ) good food , fresh , but only a notch above what you could get in the grocery store . very , very long wait time . i was the only person here and the food took 17 minutes . very , very expensive . and , they don 't serve water--you need to buy water . a bottle of water costs $ 1.89 . finally , no followup asking me if i needed anything .
asian	the celiling tiles and vents are coated with archeaological layers of dust and grime . it 's been this way for years . suprised they pass a health inspection .
asian	please help us fid great pho , bahn mi , & ramen in the greater phx area .
asian	this was the worst japanese food i 've had in a long time and very expensive . i would give it a pass .
asian	we jumped on the groupon now deal stating that we were able to get $ 20 worth of dishes for $ 10 . we made the trek out on a rainy december day to find this place ( a hole in the wall off the beaten path ) . when we got there , we were told that we couldn 't use the groupon because their " computer was broken . " not impressed ...
asian	we ordered 1 main for fish / chicken combo which is 1.5lb fish + 1 lb chicken , and they end up giving us a much bigger fish and not giving us a heads up that they will be charging more coz they gave us a bigger fish in all fairness , she brought out a fish for us to see , but i don 't know how many pounds it is ... until the bill arrived and it was actually 3lbs so they effectively charged us two orders without giving us a heads up not cool , not coming back
asian	the friggin dish of fried chicken with mini donuts are the best ! the fried chicken is on par with popeyes and donuts are better than tims . but you know what i think their seafood chow mien are not as good as those from manchu wok : ) : ) : ) : ) and yahhhh they have jackie chan 's movie omgggggggg but i wish they have the sound on . : ( : ( : ( overall a decent shit place : ) : ) : )
asian	the food is rather on the bland side for being asian food and just not served correctly . i once had to argue with a waiter that instead of mahi mahi i was eating the second dish i ordered--mabu tofu ! don 't care for this place at all , i have yet to find my enjoyable chinese food place for dinner i guess that will just have to wait .
asian	prices are steep for such a run downed looking place . pay for rice ? are you for real ? not impressed . this is not a place for koreans to go to , it may be acceptable and praised by non-koreans but this is far from a true korean bbq . they don 't give u the true fillers that you should get for your bbq ! tsk tsk ! you should be ashamed to call yourselves real korean . if i could give this place 0 stars i would .
asian	the ambiance is definitely trendy and the food comes out freakishly fast and freakishly out of order . we placed an order for two items only since we happen on this by chance and it was a late brunch tie-me-over than a proper meal . the items ordered were steam bbq pork buns and a kung pow chicken . kung pow chicken came within 7 minutes if ordering . freakishly fast . while the bbq pork buns .... i am still waiting for them as i write this review with an empty plate in front of me from the chicken .
asian	it is no longer my place to go for lttuce wraps as it no longer has them on the menu . there is quite a lot missing from the menu now . my roommate and i walked out last night because they did not have what either of us really wanted . we wont be back . perhaps the food is still good . i would not know . for thai in the north west , i think i 'll go to pin kaow instead . its too bad . the only saving grace fro bangkok 9 at this time is the iced tea . it was strong and almost bitter . just the way i like my iced tea to be .
asian	the tables are a little cramped , but if you 're by the window you can enjoy the view of forbes ave . the price is decent , but i don 't think i 've been able to get in and out in a decent amount of time . between waiting for a table and the slow orders expect to be there a while .
asian	the space is inviting and the staff is friendly . i was not impressed with the kalbi beef banh mi that i ordered . it was alright , but seemed a little dry and i 've had better banh mi elsewhere in toronto . try the : - kimchi fries : it 's almost like kimchi poutine . it 's heavy , but the flavour is good .
asian	this place is just so-so . i had the pork belly bao . bmb gives u a much larger portion of meat , more pickled veg , and the bun is also fluffier . here , i admit , i liked the peanuts in my bao . that 's about it . sorry mean bao , it 's the truth . : (
asian	the ones at that place by unlv are so much better ! i had the house special .. it was pretty gross . the meats were icky , hard to chew , and tasted god awful . the pork one was ok , but didn 't compare to others i 've had . the fiance added some coconut " paradise " shrimp to the order .. they were gross . the shrimp were mushy .. no shape to them at all .. just like eated mashed shrimp . overall i 'd stick to other banh mi places in the future ..
asian	not that good . rather have actual sushi for the price . instant regret
asian	my sushi rolls didn 't even stay together . who 's working in the kitchen . however , my dirty martini was tasty .
asian	edible but wished i didn 't make this choice . the rice was dried and uncooked and the avocado shake made me cringe with the sheer memory resurfacing to write this review . was no means a good choice of eats nor was it worth the price . being at the foodie central area , i question how angus is able to even compete with nearby restaurants . worth skipping ...
asian	barely deserves 2 stars , overly chewy chicken , uncooked ribs and flat beer , what is there to like ? besides the fortune cookies , the fancy colored ice cream is always an appeal but the experience is far from .
asian	had to call for over 10 mins just get a menu and ask 3 times for water because the waitress kept forgetting .
asian	my food was completely up to par , so nothing wrong at all with that . the staff was definitely not happy to be there , even though it was a saturday , i can understand but there is no need to be blatantly cynical and negative in front of the customers . one of the older ladies who looked like she was of management kept yelling at one girl to " look alive " and stop " standing around like you ain 't got nothing to do . " kinda rude in my opinion . will not visit again unless i 'm really hungry or desperate for food .
asian	barely walked in and the customer service was the worst lady at the front was so rude i had gastric bypass and need to eat off the kids menu she would not honor the card would even look at the card just put her hand in my face that she doesn 't honor it very poor customer service i walked out with all of my children
asian	the chicken lo mien was made with spam-ish meat product-- does that make is spamish meat product lo mien ? i ended up eating just white rice and soy sauce with egg rolls--- can 't mess up fried egg rolls right ? i did have to salt them though , they were pretty taste-less . the ambiance is less than desirable as well , our plates never got cleared and the amount of unshowered people sitting near me made me want to go home and take a hot bath with all the soap in the world . i will not return to lim 's and i suggest you not go either .
asian	it was like a freaking flashing sign : china poblano means " stay away , i 'm disgusting ! " in korean. no , really ! but my girls n i were sooo hungry we took a shot . veggie fried rice , some kind of dumpling and both were barf . i 'm sorry it tasted like someone pre-chewed mexican food and placed it back into our fried rice bowl and as the dumpling filler . granted , we were all sick that night , and not from all the free vegas drinks .
asian	vomit . puke . yes im describing the food and what i had to do after eating here . do i need to say more ?
asian	worst thai food i 've ever had . the red snapper filet was full of bones . the crab fried rice had no discernible crab . the ginger shrimp was watery . i didn 't think you could mess up fresh spring rolls , but i was wrong . everything was bland .
asian	well ... i guess that only applies to masa in new york . me and my wife spent $ 400 on dinner and we weren 't even full . that 's crazy isn 't it ? not only that , food was nothing great for what it is ! atmosphere is great , restaurant was very beautiful in and out . when we walked in , i sweat i told my wife " oh man i am soooooo excited for this . 3 star chef owned japanese restaurant ? ? yes ! ! . " oh man was i wrong . don 't let the restaurant by michelin 3 star chef fool you . it is nothing but disappointment .
asian	i did not tip because i was dissatisfied with my service and experience and the fact that they do not take american express . the server then argues with me and says i should tip him even though i am not satisfied . it is the worst etiquette to solicit a tip from a customer . i will never return to this place and i would highly recommend that no one else does either .
asian	then told me i couldn 't order what i wanted .
asian	we ordered to-go , and maybe it affected the flavor , but it was super bland and in all honesty , made me feel nauseous . i ended up only eating the mushrooms and chicken from the " matt , " but even then it still wasn 't good . we walked in on a weekday afternoon and there was no one there . we were able to get our food quickly and leave and the aesthetics were very pleasing , but it just wasn 't what i was hoping for . very disappointed . : (
asian	their mac salad wasn 't bad but it definitely wasn 't good either . i had pork katsu , it was very over cooked ( chewy and inedible towards the end ) and the batter / breading wasn 't right , much if it just fell off the pork anyway . boyfriend had chicken cutlet ( they used katsu breading for his ... ) and he said they cross contaminated the oil cause it had a shrimp taste and the gravy was lumpy as well . other friend had bbq beef which was fine , but pretty much standard .
asian	if kazu focused on preparing dishes as ordered and less on turning over tables the quality of the meal might improve. as is stands , we won 't be going back. don 't believe the hype .
asian	it was our first experience here and we weren 't impressed . the service was outstanding , but the food was not up to par . it was almost as if the fish wasn 't fresh . we have been to quite a few different places so we know what to expect in our sushi . everything we tried was medicore . we probably wont be returning to blue fin .
asian	i have to say i was not very impressed with the food . i ordered the mix plate combination which came with beef , teriyaki chicken , and mahi ( in egg batter ) . the mac salad , the rice , and the beef were fine but i found the teriyaki sauce overwhelming and the mahi not very fresh . they do give you a ton of food for a reasonable price . maybe i caught them on a bad day . i also didn 't care for the clean-up involving a ladder and lots of dust during lunch hour over the soda machine and the cups .
asian	based on current horrible report for sanitation , i will stop my 2 to 3 visits per month
asian	to sum it all up ; the service was okay , the sushi seemed creative at first until you realize they all seem to mimic one another with just slight changes . the sushi even though creative lacks flavor as a whole , the prices and ratings are too high and the food under delivers . i 'll stick with the two sushi places that i am always satisfied with sakana and hiro sushi .
asian	maybe we ordered the wrong things but this restaurant was simply not impressive . i like restaurants that are good at steaks , and good at sushi , but i guess it 's difficult to be really good at both . that being said , i 'll probably be eating at a great sushi only restaurant tonight .
asian	i 've never come across such ignoramus cows . to be yelled at while arms flailing when trying to get service and then being lied to is not how a paying customer should be treated . some of the servers in this place are miserable and intolerant . disgusting human beings .
asian	unfortunately , i was rather underwhelmed by my experience . the restaurant itself was very nice and the atmosphere was just what i was looking for ; calm and casual . the staff were also helpful and polite . the disappointment was the food itself , specifically the sushi rolls . the pieces were so small and the taste was bland . perhaps i just ordered wrong or it was an off night but my visit just didn 't live up to what i was expecting .
asian	we ended up very disappointed . we came in for lunch . there were not many options . most of the food was very bland . it 's was a cheap price which i guess that 's good . but was very surprised that my one year old and 3 year old were charged . it wasn 't much but how much can a 1 and 3 year old eat . nothing pretty much . customer service was average . honestly i wouldn 't come back to this place .
asian	i love sushi and was excited to try it . it was not good . i got two sushi rolls and i tried a piece of my co-workers sashimi . ewww was my take on that mess . there are other places around , skip this one .
asian	it was a totally big disappointment . the server was extremely unpleasant with a don 't care less attitude , the worst i have ever experienced : no basic manner at all . lychee shrimp - nothing special . marinated beef , spicy version- adequate . i was very shocked that this restaurant has all the 5 star rating ! i wonder how genuine the reviews are ! ! ! ! !
asian	clearly it is a dive which we do not mind at all as long as the food is good . the food was awful . everything on the buffet had clearly been sitting there for who knows how long and the selection was pitiful . the chicken was so dry i kept thinking of the scene in christmas vacation when the turkey explodes into dust when they cut into it . we sampled pretty much everything they had to offer on the buffet and it was all terrible . even the sodas were watered down . i 'm baffled at the average and up ratings that others have given this place . we clearly weren 't expecting 5 star out of a dive but this was pathetic .
asian	i honestly wasn 't impressed . the service people were nice . their english , however , was very poor . i had trouble communicating with the staff . they tried to do it a little different here . the standard dim sum dishes are in the carts being pushed around but their " special " dishes are behind a counter where you walk up and order . the order then gets brought to your table . i don 't know if that 's necessary but i guess you don 't have to scour the carts looking for dishes . to me the flavors weren 't good . i left feeling like i was missing something . my dim sum fix had not been satisfied .
asian	meh -- i 'm not impressed . my meal was the same ordinary , run-of-the-mill chinese food that could be purchased at any strip mall or hole-in-the-wall chinese restaurant anywhere in the us . not to disparage the owners of this restaurant , who were friendly and hardworking , but in lawrenceville there are much better places to eat than lucky dragon chinese restaurant .
asian	i was completely dismissed by a waiter when i asked for water and i had to wait between 35 minutes for each order to come . i don 't normally post reviews here but it was so terrible that it would be a disservice not to inform the community . also i had to pay $ 65.00 for two people for a lousy dinner pfft .
asian	the customer service is nonexistent , they just toss you plates and expect a tip . they kept on telling us we couldn 't order anything else until we finished what was on the plate . at the end of our stay we decided that the service didn 't warrant a tip , to which the waitress pointed out that we hadn 't . my boyfriend let them know that we were extremely dissatisfied with the service , to which the waitress said " that 's not an excuse ! . " i wouldn 't recommend coming here for anything besides a few rolls .
asian	sadly , it was disappointing . the food was below average . the seafood - scallops and prawns weren 't fresh . the crispy duck and yeung chou fried rice was below average . the only decent dish was the chinese broccoli . i sense it 's one of those places that had some glory a few years back but is now pretty run down . service staff were very nice and friendly . maybe their chef moved on because the reviews and photos certainly didn 't match what landed on our plates .
asian	it fell very far short ! the pork was terrible ( dry , too sweet ) . they gave me the wrong meat type in my dish too ( it ended up being okay though because the beef turned out pretty nice ) . took forever to get our food and no acknowledgement or apology from the staff for anything above . cannot figure out why this place has such high reviews .
asian	tried palak paneer but the paneer ( cheese ) itself was missing the dish , it was like having chicken curry without chicken . long story short the food lacked the taste that you find in good indian cuisine ...
asian	the sushi chef was nice , the service was good but the sushi was awful . the tuna was dry and tasted old . we had a tempura roll that was under cooked and soggy . the tuna on top of the rock n roll was very dried out . wouldn 't recommend it and wouldn 't go there again .
asian	you know , because maybe they might have an off day . first , the stench that this place has is almost disturbing . i would sit away from the middle area where the fountain is supposed to be ; due to the fact that the smell is emminating from there . pho tai bo vien - generous slices of meat and meatball cuts for its size ; however the broth is lacking in flavor and almost seems almost bland , if it were kept at too high of a temperature for too long . cha gio - crispy ; but again , seems like it was left in too long to cook .
asian	based on what i experienced , it was kind of a letdown ... i tried mongolian bbq before and it was so nice and i was looking forward to it , , , the sauces where diluted so the flavours were kind of not there ... and too much things to put if you don 't know how to cook or which one goes with the other , i think it 's hard ( because it was for me ) - _ - the cooked foods in the buffet was kind of bland for me ...
asian	the beef soup dumplings were probably the highlight . there weren 't enough vegetarian or seafood options here . the tea was lukewarm . the restaurant was cold . i think there are better places to go in las vegas .
asian	my daughter wanted to try the phô so we stopped in . i decided i wasn 't going to eat based on other reviews . i didn 't want to be snobby so i ordered the crab & asparagus soup . i thought it was really gross . not sure how two of my favorite foods can be combined and lack flavor . with our soups , they brought us two vegetable wontons . they were hard and dried out . not sure what was in it- tofu ? my daughter did not like the tofu in her phô but liked the rest . i won 't return .
asian	put it this way , i would travel from mountain 's edge to enjoy this place . although , last time i came here ... the rice in the nigiri had obese portions . i wish i had taken a pic to provide a visual . i 'm writing this review in hopes that this will reach the owners as constructive criticism . i understand you want us to get full quickly so we can leave , and put another paying customer 's tushy in the seat ... but be mindful that experiences like this leave bad tastes in your patron 's mouth , and people like me will most likely choose another ayce sushi place in this saturated market .
asian	i had delivery to my hotel . there was no care to ensure the sauce didn 't spill . the bottom of the bag was full of sauce and it made a giant mess . the meal itself was not very good . the chicken was very over cooked . the eggroll and soup both had a strange taste ... not bad , just strange . if i had to guess , it 's pork fat .
asian	* bad customer service * we have officially giving up on this location after tonight . 11-22-16 my wife n i been here atleast 10x n only once we got good customer service . we r great tipper n don 't understand what 's going on with this place . maybe stuck up management or employees that just don 't care but we 've seen to much bad customer interactions that made us not want to come back . food is not bad but this location forgot about their priorities . we will not come back here . too many bad experiences to list but mostly just bad service specially at the sushi bar .
asian	shiitake buns over sauced , over priced moosho vegetable . if you actually know asian food , i 'd stay clear . steak bowl had good fired rice , but was very greasy . shrimp bun shrimp had a terrible dry texture . tasted like a big mac w shrimp it 's basically just hip . same as manhattan
asian	dined in on styrofoam plates and plastic forks . chicken and string beans had flavor but extremely salty . sweet and sour chicken was tasteless . crispy noodles that are normally served when you first sit down tasted and looked like they were made of corn . we left most of our food . will never go back . it was busy so some people like it . lol .
asian	two thumbs down for customer service and cleanliness . i will never dine here again .
asian	sushi portions are abnormally large so that one can 't manage to fit it into their mouth and they are extremely poorly wrapped to the point the sushi doesn 't even make it to your mouth before falling apart ! don 't recommend !
asian	i 'm chinese and my expectations for hot pot are pretty high and this place was an epic fail . the sauces they prepared for dipping were just questionable , one of them tasted like just plain vinigar . we got one of the beef plates and one of the pork plates plus some vegatables . we literally got 5 slices of meat for $ 6.00 . i was hoping for a place comparable to hot pot in beijing , but this did not even come close .
asian	bland , sad , bad texture , not good ingredients . i had the edamame , spicy tuna , and fire mountain roll . the crunchy flakes on the fire mountain roll tasted like those edible packing peanuts .
asian	i got the bulgogi and it didn 't feel anything close to healthy . there are two items on the menu : bulgogi and bibimbap ( with a choice of tofu / shrimp / beef / chicken and rice / noodle ) the prices fall towards $ $ ( definitely not $ ) . the items are in the range of 10 $ -11 $ after tax and it takes fairly long for them to get the order ready so i guess it wasn 't really what i was expecting .
asian	tastes like p.f. chang 's frozen entrees from target . service is good . portions are large . no shrimp egg rolls ! ! ! ! ! if you want more taste for your $ , drive a little further to hunan of solon or if you want real chinese , drive to the siam cafe .
asian	basic at best over priced on most everything on there menu an there staff is not kid friendly , anyone who says they like it here have never gone to another noodle house , if you got a chance to go to any other noodle house you should
asian	basic bland chinese .. nothing memorable : ( not a lot of meat in dishes and not worth the money : (
asian	if you want more bang for your buck , just mosey on over to greenland and pick up a pork cutlet and package of curry mix . make yourself the same thing -- either 4 days of food for yourself , or a curry party for your friends . i 'm not saying curry zen was bad ... but seriously something easy to diy . but if you don 't have the time , then curry zen is your spot .
asian	bland and ordinary on most dishes . family tofu , sweet and sour , lemon chicken , gloopy and way to much corn starch in the sauce . just over all unimpressed . we did ask them to make chow fun with beef and green peppers which was very good but " seasonal .. " wtf ? seasonal ? it 's noodles , beef and bell peppers .. what 's so seasonal about that ? if in a real pinch and are dying for some chinese this is probably one of the better chinese choices in surprise . at least its not a chain or a buffet !
asian	i 'm pretty sure i will not come here again to take a date .. maybe for a casual dinner where i don 't care about my service . took an hour after we ordered to get our food .
asian	the pad thai used to consistently be delicious , and recently it lacks flavor . also , i 've had to send things back because they weren 't the way i ordered ( ex. mild as opposed to spicy , omitting an ingredient , being told items weren 't made gluten free when they were indicated on the menu ) . it seems like management is cutting corners and the food is suffering as a result . i won 't be visiting basil again .
asian	we sat for almost 10 minutes with no one approaching us . a table was sat next to us , then a guy comes by and asks for our order . the server to the table next to us , brought this chalkboard with specials on it , which i never saw , they also got their order in within minutes of sitting . food was good , but i work in the industry . this was awful .
asian	pho was alright , server was nice but the place is a horrible dive . owner is a douche
asian	bathroom dirty , old food under the table. buffet looked dirty. waitress used a dirty towel to wipe 3 tables .
asian	water all over floor . dirt everywhere . no toilet paper just a bottle of glade on the sink . restaurant space is too cramped and the booths are lumpy and sitting on the pillows is awkward . hard to get attention of waitstaff , empty water glass the whole night . also the strip mall location doesn 't do it any favors . food is good overall but nothing to fawn over . overall ambiance is okay but decor and visual taste is terrible .
asian	outdated . toilet small . if this inspires them to remodel - go for the taller toilet ! !
asian	overall the place seemed unsanitary , but food was ok . hibachi was good , the meats and shrimp were good .
asian	the food is mediocre and the same no matter which panda express you go to . the line was long , long , long , and even when we got through the line , the lady , as loud as she was , i couldn 't understand very well . once i got my food , some of the beef tasted burnt , from sitting under the heat lamp . and the chow neon was like chow me in , very blah . probably won 't come back , only came for my kids to eat quickly before the movie .
asian	lots of bones , not much meat at all ... very disappointing . spicy eggplant - very saucy , thick and sugary ! not spicy at all ! chicken and mushroom dish - odd sauce , not much flavour and odd chicken texture . i had bites of each and i had to stop as i felt nausea ... not sure whether was the sauciness , flavouring ( whatever they put in it ) or the combination of it all ! service was good ! my husband said that general tao chicken was ok ! bbq pork was also ok ! i will not go back there and i would not recommend it to others .
asian	bbq is horrible ... it more like imitation bbq ..... don 't get it and the sauce .... sucks .... i will not b going back .... ugh ... i wish they had beeter chinese food made with pride .... not just to get by .... this sucks ...
asian	duck was mostly bone . chicken rolls on the cart were cold . tea was made using tea bags . ? ?
asian	if you call to complain about it you will be told what the average tip is for your building and how you are ' too cheap ' . also if you put your tip on a credit card via their on line ordering and not on the slip in front of the driver , the drivers don 't understand that and think you are giving them nothing , and pitch an even bigger fit . dinner and a show ! thankfully the security guard in my building put a stop to it . so you tell me folks , is expecting a $ 10 tip on a $ 20 food order ( including $ 2 ' delivery fee ' ) the norm ? 50 % ?
asian	$ 60 for 2 people . what a rip-off ! hah-gow was $ 8 for 4 pieces . i could have gone to dim sum and had it with 16 pieces . hai nan chicken rice was $ 18 which my god-dad made it better than them . every main course was $ 18 at least . never had such expensive chinese food . it would be my first time and last time also .
asian	as per the server 's recommendation , we ordered the tuna and salmon tataki , the tuna / salmon tartare and either the dragon or the dragonball . all three dishes were forgettable . all tasted bland and covered with the same overly sweet brown teriyaki like sauce . i 'd recommend this restaurant to a novice sushi eater .
asian	don 't expect too much except a great looking place .
asian	both my hot sour soup and sechuan chicken had an overly vinegar undertone . nice spring roll , but that 's about it .
asian	however , owner is very uptight and makes me feel as if i 'm going to be in trouble if i do mas much as move a chair out of place or , god forbid , ask for something like sugar or ketchup . i feel bad for the one waitress who works there . also , somehow meal ends up being really pricey after you add up all the alacarte this and that . i can 't recommend going back .
asian	that 's about all the pros i have for this place . this place is a cute date place but i wouldn 't recommend it if you 're looking for authentic ramen . it 's ... kinda ... caucasian to be honest . the food is a bit overpriced for the quality and taste , but then again , it 's in biltmore . i 'd recommend tempopo if you 're looking for more authentic ramen taste but obon is excellent for a date night ! !
asian	food : 7 / 10 service : 5 / 10 price : 3 / 10 atmosphere : 10 / 10
asian	just wish the taste of the food matched the decor .
asian	sick all night long and felt terrible all through the following day . not cool , sushi guru . not cool .
asian	service was prompt , but the food was so-so and zero stars go to the appetizer calamari , which was pressed fish that was soft , soggy and horrible . it tasted like they 'd bought it from the freezer section of a supermarket and then put it on a pretty plate and aquifers green sauce on it . my husband and i thought it was the worst calamari we 've ever had and we 've never seen calamari that looked like soft fish sticks . the miso soup was good and the two rolls we ordered were just okay and nothing special . very disappointing that they put so much effort into the decor and not the food .
asian	i had to choke back a laugh when the selling point was the fish were " no more then 30 hours off the boat . " the worst part was i got sick and not from the fish , from the cous cous . 3 bites and my stomach started gurgling then 30 minutes later i was praying to the porcelain god ! flavor was actually good but i did bit into 2 lemon seeds . i 'm guessing i got sick because someone 's improperly washed hands were the strainer for the lemon juice . * gurgle , gurgle * not the way i want to lose weight .
asian	our party of six agreed that pei wei has better pad thai noodles .
asian	terrible food . there are so many good asian style buffets out there , that i thought this one might be good as well . wrong . the only good thing is the green beans . i am not a picky eater and the two times i came here i left disappointed and grossed out . i would describe the container they store their mystery sushi meat in as a " chum bucket . " yes , it 's that bad .
asian	limited menu a lot of island favorites gone . personnel not friendly . tables not cleaned off immediately for such a small place . i saw a server pick up a dropped fork and place it back in the usage bin . plus is new fountain station not limited to one drink . new decor .
asian	my order was 15 minutes late so i called to ask what was happening and the store told me that they didn 't deliver and had never gotten my order . i contacted the main company for a refund , but it 's just ridiculous the option would even be available online if the store doesn 't actually do it .
asian	we walk out , not happy ! used to busy but 7pm dinner time had 3 tables .. ! my salary not up 20 % .. or more yet ! i think it s new owner ?
asian	there was literally a dead roach in my biryani . beyond nasty . i would never recommend this place to my worst enemy after such an experience .
asian	they charge you tips ! we only had 3 adult and 1 infant , never got charge tips for only 3 people eating ! also the rice noodle and stinky tofu was really bad ! never come here again !
asian	we ordered the pan fried noodles and you literally couldn 't pick up a single noodle without all the noodles coming with . they were so burnt and so fried we didn 't even taste them because the outward appearance was so terrible ! ! we called and tried to ask about it but the person who answered said " they are supposed to be like that . " ummmm okay ! ? ? the orange chicken was good though .
asian	when you check in through yelp it says free green thai ice tea , but it 's actually a buy 1 get 1 free so make sure you don 't get fooled by this stupid promo . it 's a small glass of iced sweeten green tea ( nothing special ) which they charge for $ 5 and i honestly think it 's worth about $ 1 . if you 're looking for authentic thai or viet place , skip this one ! ! the food was either too sweet or bland . plus the service was really slow .
asian	friendly , efficient service . lots of young people in trucker hats and beanies . not a lot of asian dinners . sashimi / rolls tasted odd . just kind of shrugged it off . win some lose some when it comes to ayce sushi .
asian	my mother ate the seafood soup and 3 hours later she was feeling very ill ( vomiting and a terrible stomach pain ) .
asian	according to the south charlotte weekly june 10th edition they received a restaurant score of 70.5 from the health department .
asian	they charged for tea even though we didn 't order . they didn 't add tip when we was about to pay , but after we for the tea to be removed they added 10 $ tip . shady place . do not recommend to anyone and we will not be back .
asian	we ordered what they claimed was a 33lb lechon with the price of close to $ 300 . surprise surprise because when we started chopping the pig , the whole bottom stomach part of the lechon was completely gone . the part where you are supposed to stuff the pig ? yes it was not included . when we called to complain , they have the nerve to give me the attitude saying " that 's how it 's always been " like it was my first time to see a lechon ? this heavenly bake shop is a cheat ! ! ! i will not order from this place again ! check out the photo , the whole bottom of this pig is not included .
asian	otherwise , food is pretty good , not as authentic as tum nak thai . they have some seating although it 's not great for groups . i was not terribly impressed given the reputation .
asian	make sure you check your order ! ! ! ! made a call in order for curry chicken with cabbage , rice and peas . i received chicken and an absurd amount of cabbage . no plantain with my order either . i was quoted one price over the phone then got charged more when i got there ! also ordered a beef patty . it was tasteless and dry ! ! ! wasn 't worth what i paid . very disappointed .
asian	they will charge you around 7 bucks for a small cup of matcha green tea . they say they will add orange juice to " enhance " the flavor . the end result is beyond catastrophic : i got green color diluted , old orange juice . their pho is bland and unauthentic . all and all i 'm sad i wasted time and money on such a disappointed meal .
asian	they put things on the lunch buffet with little cards that say dinner only . the same things that other buffets have for lunch , like crawfish . pick one up and you 're charged dinner price . and even if you don 't they still try to charge dinner pricing . they tried twice on me . don 't go . food bland at best .
asian	the young looking waiter 's attitude towards customers is disrespectful - eye rolling and ' throwing ' receipts on table . this restaurant doesn 't deserve any tips !
asian	they have signs posted for special deals that are held on sun and mon but they will refuse to advertise them . the specials they had posted on the door were lower than the groupon but they told me that they " don 't work . " false advertising . completely disappointed
asian	they have more tables for couples . the waiter we got was so unenthused when my family of six walked in . he also gave lousy service . the sushi itself was average , 3 star . but i give this place 1 star because i got the worst food poisoning of my life . granted it 's raw fish , so i take a cayenne pill to help kill any bacteria which should be suitable enough ( if sushi is fresh / prepared correctly ) . unfortunately i had stomach aches , threw up , and had diarrhea . all together bad experience , would not come back .
asian	i was a regular customer , i go about 6 to 7 times a month . they served rotten smelly chickens.i got sick ended up at er rouge valley hospital.on top the don 't accept there mistake .. give it a try yourself also they charge so much for so little food compare to all other afghan food .
asian	instead he offered 10 % off the next purchase .. i 'm not going there again for the following reasons . -food is too simple -no organization -takes long time to get the order ready -the forget half of your orders -2 dollar extra for a drink ( extra hidden cost ) -mix up in menus ( keep an eye open ) -maki rolls are too dry i don 't recommend this place
asian	read the menu and be prepared to pay more than advertised ! waitress are nice but the manager , short asian with big micky mouse glasses is very rude .
asian	i 've gone there quite a bit since i 've been here , so i know the prices pretty well . yesterday i called in a order and had the person ( i believe it 's the owners spouse ) tried to over charge me by 6.00. when i complained she had the nerve to get angry with me and hung up the phone . i politely called back and let her know that i would never come in her establishment ever again .
asian	it seems as if the delivery drivers / cashiers / managers , etc. like to bump up your total after you 've signed your charge slip . they stole from me - you could be next .
asian	we ordered takeout on monday sept . 1 . i was told we should be at the restaurant at 5 : 40pm to pick up my order . i waited 25 minutes . the order was not ready till 6 : 05pm . no comment was made from the staff and no complimentary desert or anything was offered . i think this is business as usual for flo 's .
asian	i ordered the mongolian chicken with lettuce cups and when i got home no lettuce cups . i guess i learned to open everything to make sure i received what i ordered . figured pei wei would do that , but guessed wrong !
asian	when you see item " party dishes " you should know that they 've charged you tips without your permission ! ( plus the tax of the tips ) the owner is chinese and not honest enough to do the business ! i felt so bad when i left the restaurant . never ever come back and will report to government department about this issue .
asian	unfortunately i don 't necessarily think the food at ming garden has a lot of flavor . i am all about a divey chinese place , but i just don 't think this is it ! we were trying something closer to home as we typically go with ny restaurant in cornelius , and i have to say that ming garden just didn 't compare ... sorry !
asian	we thought we would try it , what a bad decision.ordered iced tea , got a sprite , took them a long time to bring our food , for that tiny little pieces , bit pricy. no all u can eat. spent $ 70 for two people before tip , left hungry. was afriad to order more , didn 't want to wait another 30 mins. so disappointed. went to mc donalds to satisfy hungry belly. never go back again .
asian	turns out i 'm quite disappointed . paid 9.89 $ for this picture below . the food tasted ok but i don 't find any attractiveness to going back .
asian	there were 3 other cars there waiting for changs to open , so i thought that was a good sign . very small inside , and not much of a selection . i guess i expected more than 9 dishes to choose from , including rice and vegetables , & pudding . the recipes of the dishes they did have seemed kind of bland . not a big fan , and will not be going back .
asian	there was , however , nothing about japanese except for a table soy sauce bottle . and the food was awful - both presentation and taste . stale , greasy , soggy , bland - you name it . the worst buffet ever . interior decoration was in complete chaos and i doubt that they even care . night club like multi-color changing lights were very distracting for lunch time . the only " super " thing was that there 's a vast selection of bad taste food including chinese , mexican and american . the overall service was just mediocre .
asian	because they got butthurt about my original review ... theyre overpriced and unsanitary ( : -goodluck eating there .
asian	but for my first visit , i wasn 't bowled over . the decor and atmosphere of this place is great . no complaints there . our server was friendly and attentive , so no complaints there either . but i ordered the pad thai for lunch and while it tasted good , i was seriously disappointed to receive a huge serving of rice noodles but only three medium sized shrimp in the entire dish ! honestly , a serving of noodles that size should have had double that amount of shrimp . hopefully they 'll do better on my next visit or there won 't be a third !
asian	, , ] beccause other thai rest. in usa i taste , all lousy , only this one ok , all other food ok for me , but pad thai noodle was very lousy , taste like sweet sour noodle and crab fryrice only one piece small tiny crab like quarter / do not go lunch , they charge same price anyway , my my commen / dinner 4 star lunch sorry only 2 star /
asian	i would not recommend . i now go to the new asian cuisine right down the street .
asian	i have experienced better . ( insert farting noise here )
asian	sesame chicken wasn 't bad . the brown rice was bland . no taste what so ever . the egg roll was bland as well . not even sure what was inside when all you see is white . the prices are more then red dragon on poplar tent . we probably won 't be coming back to chia bistro as we 'd rather go somewhere that costs less and tastes a whole lot better .
asian	beef and fish over cooked ... not enough spicy ... noodle are not will cooked ... over all food taste ok ... no surprise .. and also they will force you to give them 5 stars and writing 50 words good review for them before getting the 15 % off after checking on yelp ... no wonder they having 4 half stars over all ...
asian	very disappointed after spending $ 60 for 1 person .
asian	i was expecting the typical five spice taiwanese fried chicken but it was smoked chicken ? ? wth ? it tasted like smoked ham but with chicken if that makes any sense . just weird and off . definitely disappointing and will not come back .
asian	beef noodle soup was very bland and not well cooked twice cooked pork ok totally empty on saturday night minus the whole family of the owners wouldn 't recommend
asian	banh mi served on a hoagie bun ? pho served with udon instead of the traditional rice noodles ? wtf ! ? i live a few blocks away and used to go to miss saigon all the time . now , every couple weeks i 'll convince myself it 's worth going to kanda house just because it 's convenient and i regret it every time . i swear this is the last time ! it 's also more expensive than miss saigon used to be too . judging from how empty it is every time i 've gone , i can only hope that it will go out of business soon and miss saigon will return .
asian	the soup was kind of bland but the beef was real tender . my wife had the shrimp ramen . she was not a fan . i give it a shot and neither am i .
asian	comes w / a mini salad , rice & miso soup . i only give 2 stars bc the amount of meat changes every time i go . i wanna try one of their sandwiches next but i never go in the afternoons .
asian	chicken skewers are tasteless frozen breast shoved on a stick . thai curry was super spicy even at 4 out of 10 stars - still pretty tasty.green tea was hot and wet , not much to say about that . decor was nice a typical japanese fusion . dust falling of the light fixture wasn 't too cool either .
asian	i believed that photo there have enlarged the portion a lot . it is taiwanese food but nothing spectacular compare to local asian restaurants . taiwanese style fried chicken is close to authentic . i do suggest to try for a simple lunch but not for a meal . taro pancake is actually not bad but expensive at 2.50 $ / piece .
asian	it didn 't taste fresh and it was so sweet i couldn 't even identify that it was beef . would have been better off with a tv dinner . my husband on the other hand views this place as a good option when running errands in the area because it 's " fast and cheap . " well , i don 't know about either of those , they aren 't fast food fast or cheap but it certainly tastes like it .
asian	got a bowl : flavors dont go together too well , rice on the bottom gets soggy , and overall not a meal where you look forward to eating the next bite . honestly not a fan when it comes to quality , but il ll give it 2 stars since the bowl was only 3.50 .
asian	been 20 minutes i 'm sitting at a table right now nobody has came to me yet and i am going to walk to the fridge take a drink and leave , i see why there is nobody here. sad : ( at least ima get a free drink
asian	ordered the korean short ribs and they were horrible ! chewy , fatty and just not good ! and they charge $ 16 for them ! my wife had the chicken teriyaki and the chicken was grizzly and not good . will never go back ! panda express is better !
asian	took another couple in for dinner and two of the four dinners ( sweet and sour chicken and orange chicken ) were very over cooked . you couldn 't penetrate the chicken with a fork , it was hard as rocks . we called the server over and showed her . she said she could replace one meal with " exact same price meal " but not both , and " no refund-just replace one meal . " so , you served two poorly cooked entrees but will only replace one . not how i expect to be treated , so we won 't be going back .
asian	my food didnt come out until everyone else was done eating and it was time to leave ( part of my meal actually came out as we were walking out the door ) ... but i was still charged full price though ! i will not be back .
asian	food is decent but not fantastic , and the same can be said about the service . the pad thai leaves something to be desired for as well . went again a few nights ago and ordered the basil beef and end up with several days of mild food poisoning which started within less than an hour of leaving . buyer beware ....
asian	over the past few months the prices have risen so much and the portion sizes ridiculously small , there 's no more advantage to sticking around . sushi is still wonderful , but many better places now in charlotte .
asian	apparently there was a recent change and i was charged an extra $ 2 for this change . salmon is one of the cheaper fish out there ( compared to tuna ) . so i switched the tuna for cheaper fish and get charged an extra $ 2 . and this is not reflected anywhere on the menu . what a way to treat a 14-year regular customer that have spent thousands ( literally ) dining at your restaurant . i will be hesitant to go there again now ...
asian	throughout the years , i seen many employees come and go and i hate to say this but this place has lost its luster . i agree with a lot of people on how after being served , the waiters just forgets about you . the service keeps on getting worse as time goes by and what made me keep returning to this place is that maybe i would get that one more chance to dine here like i used too with excellent food and good service . now me and my fiancé will now be hunting for our new pho place .
asian	service was slow today at toro . took 10mins for someone to come by our table , with a pretty empty restaurant at 7pm . the menu has changed alot . no more bentos for dinner just lunches and prices did go up . i was looking forward on having that oh so good bento box , sadly no luck for me ... the food was still good and all but i didnt feel the love of toro sushi when i first visited . it was kinda stale in my part . it felt so homey ... no ... mehhhh ... i dont think i can recommend this restaurant anymore and i wont be back in a long time .
asian	all times they switched servers on me so the person i was leaving my tip to wasn 't the server who originally waited in me . this last visit my i had missed orders because the lady was in such a rush to get out of here she didn 't bother writing down my order and when i asked her , no apology . just i didn 't hear you . maybe you should have written it down , is more like it . the server who took her place left the bill , didn 't bother to look that we had leftover pizza for takeout . so we had to get our own box . disappointed .
asian	gets worse every time ( service , food , all of it ) . dim sum trendline is down at the gb !
asian	last night , however , i was calling for fifteen minutes to place an order for pickup , we were under a time crunch , and just kept getting voicemail after several rings . eight times i tried to call over that time , and no answer . ended up picking up japanese food instead .
asian	the food was great , cory our server was amazing . tony the manager was not very professional and rude when i had a concern . what upset me the most , was his attempt throw our server cory under the bus and blame him . that is beyond unacceptable . i have visited osaka a lot . my interaction with the manager really ruined a great night . i 'm really bummed that i feel i need to find a new sushi place .
asian	we came today n literally dont want us to serve bcuz of wat happen b4 . lols . seriously they don 't want your opinion about their food , they should make their papaya salad better not like kicking us out . whoever d owner this establishment surely don 't know how to fix their problems . adios ! ! hopefully u guys will last ... go to sushi san , just search on yelp ! ! ! !
asian	waited almost 50 minutes for food and near the end of the meal the server put up a sign on the door turning customers away . the actual restaurant is pretty beat up and needs a good cleaning- the cups and pitchers really need to be replaced .
asian	she said she would let the chef know but still charged me full price for the roll ... i paid it but will not be going back ....
asian	the food is still good , if unremarkable , but the service has gone from good to acceptable to substandard . the servers always seem to be in a rush , probably because there is only ever one person for the entire place . this may be my last visit .
asian	i don 't know why i was supporting a restaurant and kept coming if the service was just ass ! ! ! all their servers are so goddamn rude and hostile that i can 't even ask for water ? aside from that i 've been tipping them every visit yet this lady had the audacity to tell me that i never tip them uhm ....... nope rather go get my pho somewhere else . worst place . in conclusion , if i could give them no stars i would . spend your money elsewhere !
asian	came in today and wow portions suddenly got smaller . no longer a good deal . time to move on !
asian	today , one of my coworkers was served a deep-fried cockroach , in addition to his dumplings . as bad as that was , the staff 's reaction was even worse . upon alerting the waitress to the situation , she simply took the tray ( and item in question ) away , and brought back replacement dumplings ... in what seemed to be the same tray . no further comments , nor apparent concern . full bill charged . as yelp says , " eek ! methinks not . "
asian	the sushi is amazing and the price are great . went there one day and there was a bunch of open seats at the bar . i was in a party of 5 but couldn 't be seated since every spot that was empty was dirty . waited for about 15 mins watching no one clean the tables . eventually said forget this and walked out . service is absolutely the worst i have ever seen . the place is great food wise but service wise mcdonalds is better .
asian	today i drove all the way from henderson to this location today and was told they no longer give away free car washes with oil change . i paid 80.00 just for my oil change . they have lost a loyal customer today .
asian	slow service to the point of frustration . ( our sushi sat at the sushi counter for close to 10 minutes before the waiter noticed it ) massive maki pieces with tons of rice , i should of taken a photo of this disgusting monster . i don 't know if its new management or what , but it will be our last visit to this sushi restaurant . * the visit was on sunday night. oct 31 2010
asian	been coming here for years , at least 3 times a month for pad thai- tried to place a pickup order at 9 : 30 ( they close at ten ) wasn 't able to order a bubble tea because the guy told me that he already cleaned the blender they use to make it- fuck that- it 's rude and irritating- walk a half block and go to tree country bistro- at least they want your money- forget about about high thaid
asian	best fried dumplings , egg foo young , & crab rangoons . however , getting a low score due to no delivery . i have to take the bus and this place is very inconvenient to get to due to route cuts .
asian	this place is no longer worth it and they actually charged us a mandatory service charge although it was just me and my wife . i live in the area and try to support local businesses as much as i can . sad to say that i will no longer be going back to this place as there are better options near by .
asian	very disappointing meal tonight . i decided to take out this evening and was very turned off by how salty the food was . egg foo young was nasty ... it was over fried and tough . the sauce was watery and so salty that i couldn 't eat but a few bites . the cantonese chow mien was runny and salty as well . the restaurant was totally empty and know i can see why . this family that owns the restaurant has always had quality food it 's too bad that they have let the quality go so far down hill .
asian	the food is still good but the service sucks . every time i come they forget something . last time we had all you can eat , and they forgot half our order ... no big deal ... we filled out another form ... the next round , forgot 2 things .... then nobody came to our table for over 30mins ... until i asked for the bill ... then they jumped . now , i 'm currently sitting in the restaurant ; ordered the exact same thing i always get , and no miso soup or salad ... everyone is getting their meal before me . i need to find a new place ! i 'm done with this restaurant .
asian	select dishes are very good such and kowloon crab and dried scallop and crab fried rice . however , the service and simply rude and appalling . there are a lot more great options for authentic chinese food in the valley .
asian	sushi is great , i 'll give them that .... but service has been going down hill for last couple of months . on our last visit , maybe only three tables were occupied and even then , service was bad . drinks came almost when we were done eating . waitress didn 't even give us plates . even felt a little discriminated by staff . very disappointing to see a place that i really enjoyed coming to eat with my husband , not want us to come back in the future .
asian	my buddy ordered the chicken pho and it came out first from the rest of our pho , except his soup was warm ( suitable to eat right away while each of ours were scolding hot ) and the chicken was far undercooked and the waiter insisted that that was the way it was in their restaurant . i 've never seen pho like that before . i noticed in the kitchen that there was a huge vat left on low heat just sitting there , which is probably where the chicken pho came from . the waiter did offer us a voucher for a free bowl of pho for our next visit , but we would never come back here .
asian	been coming to this place for a little over 18 years the past owners we 're always very friendly prices were always good went there today because i was craving it and the prices are insane almost $ 13 a bowl the gentleman at the register was the owner i asked him and he said because minimum wage went up his prices went up and they 'll go up again next year way too pricey for the area it seems like portion sizes or smaller the new owner was rude after i had question why the prices had come up so much when i had been a frequent customer he began to slam things around very unprofessional will not get my business ever again good luck
asian	decided to call tonight and ask a few questions about the menu . advertised as open until 10 called at 940 no answer . ok maybe they are a bit busy . gave it a few minutes and tried again . just rings and rings no answer . if your open until 10 answer the phone to your potential customers .
asian	less than impressed . i ordered tom kha goong or coconut soup , pad thai . pad thai : extremely chewy like eating seaweed rubber bands and the flavor lacked . tom kha goong : too much cocunut milk and not enough broth , also veggies were tossed in broth completely raw after soup was poured into a bowl . overall i will keep looking for a more suitable thai food restaurant .
asian	even stopped us when retrieving the bill and asked us for more tips . do you deserve 20 % tips ? you want us to put down another nickel ? ridiculous . you have lost a long time customer , service quality going down over the years at bayview location . mccowan store is much better .
asian	picked up my to go order ( which took 45 minutes for 2 rolls & 1 order of albacore ) the waitress said they were " cooking " my food still and u thought she was joking until u got home & the albacore was cooked ! it 's sushi ! ! ! ! ! ! raw sushi cooked ! ugh im never going back again
asian	it keeps going downhill though . todag got a shrimp salad and the shrimp were so overcooked the were like rubber . also the shrimp used to be big and meaty . today there were some the size of my fingernail . the shrimp is pretty pricey to be small and overcooked . i keep coming back because it used to be so amazing . but today was the last straw .
asian	the food quality has gone down hill considerably . soups were bland . entrees sub par . probably won 't go back . our waitress was fine and the service was fine . but the food actually sucked . very disappointed . we used to love this place . there is also a small ipad on every table for kids to use while waiting . be fore warned they charge you $ 2.00 if you turn it on . i know $ 2.00 isn 't a big deal , but my beef is they should let you know up front that there is a charge for it . they were gracious enough to take it off our bill , but why cause the inconvenience ?
asian	thought they were great . spent some of my military service time in japan . love all japanese food but lately i believe some mba got involved with their business plan and the quality of the beef went to hell . spoke to the manager about it . he told me has had many complaints but headquarters changed beef suppliers to cut costs and he was unable to do anything about it . now the yakitory is dark meat chicken only . must be the same mba . increasing profits while cutting quality . what a shame . won 't be going back again . maybe you can increase profits by eliminating the shrimp in the tempura and then the vegetables next . abunai , abunai .
asian	when the previous owners sold years ago the restaurant went downhill big time ! ! i don 't mind paying top dollar for good sushi but this place is not worth the money at all . i use to dine in and get take out at least once a week ( $ 200 worth of take-out for my family ) and when i would come pick up the food and ask for some spicy mayo they actually had the decency to charge me for some hot sauce ( pretty sad ) . don 't go there anymore , much better options in richmond hill .
asian	i was waiting for my food pick up and well . lets say there were a little family of cockroaches crawling up and down the table . i got a little throw up in my mouth and just walked out . i know the place has never looked the cleanest . i draw the line at live insects in the building .
asian	what if i have left overs ? there not gonna take it for to go ? am i wasting my money here ? ? ? im very dissapointed ! ! !
asian	chicken and rice bowl . had been a month or two since last visit , today i went and ordered a chicken bowl to go . got back to my office and added their teryiaki sauce , thought it looked kind of red . took a few bites and it was not teryaki sauce at all , some kind of red spicy sauce . that was all i had in my bag . i dont know why they went away from their teryaki sauce , really it was teryaki chicken i ordered . not chicken with some random hot sauce on it . needless to say , the meal is ruined and i will not be going back there until they change back to teryaki sauce .
asian	decided to try it out despite the amount of negative reviews . i was very disappointed with service and food quality . was hoping it would be similar to khao san road but was no where close . i will never return to this establishment . bad food , bad service and way over priced for the quality . even complained about the food and the server didn 't care to hear our feedback . maybe if they actually listened to some of the feedback they could improve . save your money and avoid this establishment .
asian	hate it don 't recommend i rather drive to cali . plus they give small amount of meat it 's mostly rice and the price increase man i 'm so disappointed and i love yoshinoya not this one
asian	food was barely tolerable . potstickers were ground beef fried in oil that needed changing and was overlooked . the mongolian beef was adequate but the teriyaki chicken meal was awful . the chicken had obviously been cooked separately and then some cheap , too thick probably no-name brand teriyaki sauce was applied after . neither of us could eat it . disappointing , but that happens sometimes trying new small places . don 't recommend , but maybe ymmv . won 't be back .
asian	is this place under new ownership or management ? both orders were not prepared correctly and had very wilty broccoli . even the spring rolls were different , not sure what the change is but don 't like it .
asian	been going here for 2 months. food is good. crablegs are very small. waterlogged. have to wait too long to refill pan. only put out a few legs. wont be returning. not worth the wait .
asian	today i decided to take some new friends , my wife accidentally wrote her name in the wrong spot on the waiting page and one of the servers told her that because of her mistake we now had to wait even longer . she made it a point to make my wife feel like shit in front of our friends and strangers . really ! ! ? ? their food is amazing but the customer service leaves much to be desired . they have no idea that i belong to a huge global food service organization .
asian	there 's usually only one chef , so if things get busy you sit for a while . lunch special is a good deal but not if you have to wait 40 minutes ! servers seem annoyed and put out if you ask for something . time to find a new spot !
asian	the plates literally had crud all over them . that 's a good indicator of the sanitation of the kitchen . i had to ask a hostess to take the order because the lady left us there forever . you could tell by her response it happens alot and she was embarrassed as if it was normal . if your the owner and you are reading this : get your place together or i promise you won 't be around for very long with the development moving out here .
asian	however i ordered ( delivery , which took about an hour ) an order of fried wontons ( which were hard and cold ) , thai iced tea ( that was warm with a little ice in it , ) and pan fried noodles . i didn 't have a problem with the noodles until i started eating and as i was thinking how tender the beef was i found a metal staple looking thing in the meat . it hurt my tooth even . will never order here again sadly . : /
asian	last few times the owner has been progressively getting worse in his customer service . arguing and adding bogus extra $ $ amounts . lost 2 loyal customers hope you change your attitude or you will lose many more ..
asian	service is good only when you get the female or the owner . the other guys don 't know what they are doing . i called ahead for my order . i was told my order would be ready in 15 minutes . 35 minutes later i 'm served cold curry and asked to heat it up myself at home . i 'm never going back again .
asian	fried egg rolls and beef pho the former came out small and burnt the latter didn 't come at all . i ate the egg rolls and thought oh well but i was basically ignored while the wait staff entertained themselves . decided to leave after 25 min . and i was one of only a handful of customers , not like they were busy you know.honestly the place has been in decline for some time now . come on guys straighten up .
asian	i really wanna like it as i live nearby but anymore i drive to the west side location which is not perfect but it has higher quality food . why can 't this town have one good chinese place , i 'd eat there once a week ! instead we have 50 awful ones and three mediocre . this is one of the mediocre , but for the price it should be considerably better. maybe this is what midwestern mall shoppers want ?
asian	but they got me really sick . i had the uni and seafood salad . when i called and let them know the girl was odd all she said was ' no one else has said anything ' . she asked if i wanted the supervisor i said ' no i just want you to know something i ate made me sick probably the uni ' if no one else got . she said ok and hung up ... no we are very sorry or we will throw it out .
asian	they forget what you order and stare at you with a blank face when you don 't want what they happen to bring .
asian	love the owner . but my last two visits have guided my decision of not going back . when i asked for thai spicy , the dish would be hair-raising . last two times had no spice . what i am going to try to not to lose sleep over is how the lunch special l5 with chicken and a glass of house chardonnay cost twenty bucks . over charged a dollar for meal and $ 8 for a tiny house wine . while their food is not super , guess i 'm sticking with thai house and saigon palace from now on since i don 't like the feeling of being had .
asian	the food and service is going downhill . last night entrees arrived 15 minutes apart . manager who appeared to be about 16 said it was because they have two kitchens ? apparently they don 't talk to each other . avoid
asian	just recently they messed up two of our to go orders in a row and then blamed is for them not understanding is correctly and not to mention someone with a very thick hard to understand accent should not be taking phone orders . the next order i found burnt or charred pieces of something in my sound and my boyfriend found shrimp shells in his chicken noodle dish . it seems like they were careless in making out food in most likely dirty pans and things were definitely cross contaminated . getting a refund was a huge hassle ! we haven 't been back since . the though of it still makes me feel sick !
asian	absolutely the best fresh chinese you 'll find anywhere . the owner is very friendly and greets and chats with most customers . if you become a repeat customer , expect to be greeted with a welcoming smile . it 's unfortunate that he lost the lease in tempe just after the 1st of the year , but they are open again at their new location 4030 w ray rd e1 , chandler , az stop by and give them a try you won 't be disappointed . update 1 / 16 / 13 since moving the portions have shrunk , the prices have risen and the quality also has slipped .
asian	dumplings and noodles is still good but beef stew sucks .
asian	new owners are the worst . unfriendly , cold , the place is dirty , they are rude and just such a bad experience . it 's sad because this was my husbands and mine weekly sushi joint and now the he has passed away it would of been nice to have this place as a fun reminder . but i will never go back here !
asian	never had a problem till last visit . ordered a bunch of food . my wife found part of a scouring pad in her dish . crunchy she said . that 's weird . and there it was a curly piece of steel . flat and sharp . never again . i always over looked the general unkept appearance but i will never eat there again . be careful .
asian	this experience was forgettable . very little flavor to the food . our chef was ok , not great . the food and the experience was not worth the money . we paid for better than we received ...
asian	pretty disappointed .. place was completely empty and had no atmosphere . portions are super small compared to yonge and steeles and more expensive too . service was super slow and we were the only table there on a saturday night . deep friend boneless chicken was pretty tender tho and the medium hot blazing fire chicken was pretty spicy compared . beers are cheap , $ 4.50 / bottle
asian	very mediocre food i don 't need the arrogance of the owner acting as though they 're doing you a favor , so many wrong orders just to be told that it was my fault . my friends always remember there 's a reason why a restaurant is 80 % empty most of the time .
asian	it doesn 't taste great anymore , i have to chew some sand with the food and i can 't even eat the fish . i also ask for the onion fried and it not even in my meal .
asian	the quality goes up and down . last saturday however , we learned that they charge $ 1 per person for tea . i don 't even drink tea . i order soda . they don 't even ask you if you want tea they just serve it . i asked them how they figure who is and who isn 't drinking the tea . they could not give me an answer . so before you order and they bring you that tea you better make sure you want it and you tell them who are the people who are going to be drinking it .
asian	okay we have a mini chocolate cracker for my daughter ( 4year old ) . take note been dining here atleast twice a week and every time we dine we always bring a snack for her and ddnt have any problem until today. you just lost one of your loyal customers. and nope wouldnt recommend this place ever again. very disappointing .
asian	both at different times and days of the week . horrible service i would not recommend this place for sushi there are better options in phoenix
asian	service gets worse every try . we were one of 3 tables in the entire place and our server was mia to take our order and to clear plates . food was okay if i was on my couch eating leftovers . it tasted like takeout with a higher price tag . decor is very nice regardless .
asian	this time we went for my birthday lunch and ended up paying $ 80 for 4 adults , really ? ? ! ! they charge you like dinner portions , $ 10 or 3 pieces of shrimp and small plate of noodles , they classify as " large , " then they act like they can 't read or speak english when you 're trying to ask about the charges on the receipt . there are plenty of other chinese / dim sum / buffet areas in vegas . definitely not coming back to this place ! ! !
asian	i would not mind too much if the place was packed and really busy , but when we went we were either the only ones there or just a couple other people that were already there before us that were about to leave . the food here not too bad when eating there , but we did takeout just recently and the pho just tasted really nasty for some reason . this place is only a few minutes from me but i will not go back anymore . there are better places less than 20 minutes away that have better service and better tasting pho and other dishes that i would rather go to .
asian	3 times fo ayce . worst ayce ever the food comes in a bad quality , arrived late , etc . and its pretty pricy . overall terrible
asian	in my salad i had a big plastic piece ! ! ! ! plastic can you imagine ? ! ! then we ordered water never get them only after 3 times ! ! ! i ordered also a beer guess what ! ? ! ? never get it ! ! the meat grade was awful ! ! you need always to look for your server for 3-4 min ! that 's my last time here ! ! ! ! service for me is everything ! ! !
asian	the send 1 tray of crab legs and there are 6 people on each side waiting for them to drop the new pan . if you are here to eat crab legs ..... plan on making it an all night event . good luck finding someone that understands " you are out of crab legs . " all they know how to do is smile and shake their heads yes ... but they dont understand . very over priced , 20.00 for dinner and the quality of sushi is 3 stars at best . hope this is helpful .
asian	dined in 4xs and took take out tonight at midnight because no one else was open . customer service is awful . no personality and seem stressed being the only one on the floor . i ordered the shrimp don and my mom ordered the tempura udon . both were awful . i asked for udon noodles and we got home and found out we had cold soba noodles in a cold square instead hot udon . won 't be back . best to dine in . 1 star for late night hours .
asian	i was politely ask to fix my karaage issues but she come back with the same chicken saying i will just take it off the check instead of fixing it correctly ! ! ! the owner is not here by the way ! ! ! very disappointing , not sure if im going to return to this place again ! ! !
asian	however i went the other day and got the khao san road ice cream . got food poisoning about 2 hours later . never going back .
asian	the food is decent can 't complain there . however the service is lacking big time . there 's one old man in particular who is kind of rude and when i asked for the bill while waiting without getting my water refilled he shooed me off and completely ignored me . i 'm sorry to bother you sir but i would like to pay my bill . won 't ever come back again and i don 't suggest coming here to anyone
asian	this is a good place if you have family members that don 't eat sushi as there is a wide selection of cooked foods . i would much prefer dragon legend but it 's also pricier than wasabi . sushi rolls weren 't fresh but sashimi was pretty good . the first time we came the sushi was order off the menu and it was better . last time the sushi was left out and you help yourself . cooked food also not the greatest . your typical buffet quality food .
asian	it has never impressed me but they recently added a quick facelift. ie. paint . the food is not impressive. the duck is supposed to be their specialty however it is bland when compared to other restaurants . what really did not impress me was that the service was very poor . when the family mentioned a peanut and nut allergy and asked if they could be careful to ensure that the chef ensure no cross contamination , the server said it was a hassle and too much effort . in addition , the service was overall poor in that they did not serve the soup as most chinese restaurants would or take away done dishes in a timely manner .
asian	it 's a convenient neighbourhood restaurant . pho and bun is ok . i wouldn 't make a trip to eat here , but if you are in area and craving pho and cheap- this would do .
asian	this time i waited an hour for sushi ! pretty sure the waitress didn 't ring in half our order . sat here 20 minutes without water . spicy salmon roll was salmon roll with a dollop of sriacha on top ? only reason why i 'm giving it two stars and not one is because the live music was pretty good . won 't be back any time soon .
asian	i ordered on grabb , came down just to have my order cancelled infront of me . no apologies were given , basically an explanation that they should not have turned on the app and i would be refunded . i would have to wait 25 minutes after they finished catering to get my food . good food and bad service .
asian	a couple of times were carry out , and once was sit down . there food isn 't amazing , and the staff isn 't anything to write home about . the sushi i got from take out was warm , and they got my order wrong . there are much better places around .
asian	the pho doesn 't taste that great anymore ( or maybe i just have to be drunk to enjoy it ) and the service was rude and rushed . .. would rather pay $ 20 for a bowl of pho on the strip .
asian	it 's not a bad restaurant but it 's pricey for what you get . the food is just ok . the decor and ambience is just ok . the service is just ok . so you would think the prices would be average but it 's a bit high for what you get . that being said if you 're in the mood for sushi and you 're in the area , this is probably the best restaurant around this strip of bloor .
asian	their egg rolls are small and not fresh at all , the lettuce that goes with it were soggy and old lettuce . my combination pho had absolutely no tripe in it and the broth was just bleh , dont ever think ill be returning back. but for once the server checked up on us more then usual , that was the only plus .
asian	got seated right away which was amazing . the seats were pretty crammed since the restaurant is pretty small . but that 's the usual anyways . i ordered " somtam " and " pad thai " and both were bad . somtam was very salty . so salty that my tongue started burning . ( was not spicy at all ! ) then i got my pad thai which was very sweet . i kept adding the chili flakes hoping to tone the sweetness down and it did nothing. the noodles were stuck together and i had to stop eating half way through . maybe it was just my lucky day but i don 't think i will be testing my luck here ever again .
asian	took my team there for a team lunch . i have had better experiences there before my most recent experience was disappointing . i ordered an expensive ' love ' boat filled with rolls and sashimi . the rolls were ok , as expected . the sashimi was disappointing in terms of portion as it was paper thin . it is as if they split one regular piece into four pieces . ended up still hungry afterwards .
asian	it 's ok . not the worse , not the best . i personally prefer indian palace ( on this side of town ) for the money . nothing here was extremely tasty or very spicy ( i like spice and spicy ) ; it was palatable . staff is fast on refills of water which is always appreciated .
asian	this last experience , however , was not good . really not good . i couldn 't even finish my bowl of miso soup . it was so sour ( i didn 't think miso could go bad ? ) and had just a few pieces of the saddest seaweed and tofu . as far as the sushi , they seem to have an affinity for the mayonnaise-y drizzle over everything . i don 't really respect that approach in the first place and they really take it to an extreme here . finally - the cardinal sin . they used imitation crab meat in the california roll . this may be a reason why we were the only people in there .
asian	i did like the live music ! food was decent , but it took forever ! ordered the drunken noodles , tom yum soup , basil dish and stuffed chicken wings . we asked for a certain level for each dish and they all came out opposite . it was so spicy that we didn 't even enjoy our food . never got our water filled and our tongue was burning . definitely told myself that i wouldn 't come back because of their customer service .
asian	pretty rude that was , and the food is only okay level with not really a worth price , prob going to sushi 168 next time
asian	customer service is always iffy but when it is busy , forget it and walk away . went when it was busy one time , we were seated next to another two people and our tables were together . it was very awkward . the service is also extremely terrible during busy times . the sushi is excellent and their lunch specials are great ! would recommend going at a odd time when they are not busy but still expect just mediocre service .
asian	all was good . went for lunch today and brought some coworkers . not too busy at all . 4 guys working the floor . sat there for 10 mins and not one waiter acknowledged us . i mean walked right by us not even to offer us water . sad to see such piss poor service . had plans to bring friends fri evening . don 't want to embarrass myself again . hope you don 't experience what i just did .
asian	it 's an ok place but i had better . service is good and the product is like i said ok . i 've had mr. sushi on black canyon hwy which is better .
asian	today the food was terrible . the choices were limited . most of the entrees were cold or lukewarm . the sweet tofu was thick and sticky and lacking syrup . the buns were dry . won 't be coming back here again .
asian	pile of rubble as of 07 / 01 / 2014 . don 't know if they 're rebuilding .
asian	every time i tell them and end up waiting even longer . taste wise it 's pretty standard , nothing i 'd rave about , they 're pretty lucky they 're the only ramen open late .
asian	today was my last time . rice overcooked into a mushy paste . rubbery overcooked chicken . the " scallops " were definitely not scallops rather looked and tasted like little crumbles of white fish . carrots tasted and looked like baby food . terrible does not begin to describe our meal .
asian	i think i would rather have panda express , but its a toss up
asian	as the other reviews mentioned , the pho sucked ( thick flat rice noodles , crappy broth , etc ) . no love for xe lua unfortunately .
asian	been here a few times. the food is okay. the service is okay. it had problems with the demerits from the health dept. some pretty bad ratings from them so i don 't go anymore
asian	i don 't know what happened this time but the service and food was not so great . i had a pretty bad stomach flu the week after , and i felt the sushi boat we ordered could 've been made better as it looked a little sloppy and unclean . as for the service , although the place was full when we arrived , i felt it was hard to get their attention . my friend and i were totally okay with sitting at the bar , since we did not want to wait for a table however , i felt we were ignored as they were too busy seating the larger parties who came later .
asian	the broth is never hot enough in the pho and the floor is always dirty with food . pretty gross . if this was in orange county , they 'll be out of business cause they can 't compete with the big doggies .
asian	each time the service and food is forgettable . using the usual caldo yellow chicken msg broth and a mediocre recipe , along with the untimely response to bring out my order , i won 't be coming back here .
asian	i was in the mood for noodles something .. we started off with the app of potstickers in an extremely spicy broth . holy crap this is extremely spicy hence the name of the dish . i ordered a beef udon dish with veggies and udon .. it was okay. husband had chicken parm . shocker ! prob wont be back for awhile spent $ 40 bux and had better at yc 's mongolian today : )
asian	i asked why they charged for the tapioca suddenly , and they replied " nothing is free . " they changed the rules on the whim , not even notifying the customers. never coming back
asian	ramen was ok at best . gyoza was forgettable . and there teriyaki steak was some of the worst i had in a long time . overall cool concept but they really need to revamp their food to survive .
asian	went 8 / 4 for lunch . 40 mins to get a rainbow roll bento box that was fair at best . prices went up too . looks like i 'll be heading to ra when i 'm in that area .
asian	first time ( a few years ago ) was pretty good . last experience wasn 't great . seems like each visit is worse than the last . gave them one more try . service was brusque . flavors were mediocre , most dishes too sweet . not coming back . not much more to say .
asian	food was usually good . this time , the sushi tasted bland and prepared quickly . they fell apart in the plate . the beef ginger along with the pad thai were the best from the whole meal . oh and my gf got a big black spider on her from under the table . the waiter just laughed . fare well sushi st jean .
asian	tonight we brought family and it 's terrible . we waited for 30 min for food and it 's not good at all . edamame came out last and it 's over cooked . nigiri is flavorless and the cooked rolls took forever . on top of that , service is terrible . our waiter is very nice but clearly spread too thin because we haven 't seen him in about 15 minutes . probably not coming back unless we 're desperate .
asian	did it 's usual ok . came tonight , ( don 't come for dinner ) . it 's like the whole state of minnesota is here . the food didn 't taste that great this time either . sushi rice was dry . tea tasted like water . not happy .
asian	food is decent . my issue is the rude servers especially one old korean lady . we asked for something so simple that every other korean place i have been ro has on the menu ( pork kim chi soup ) and for the second time were here she disappeared and five mins latter a white guy took our order .. so rude from ehen we walked in till ignoring us . wont be back !
asian	been here few times ... i fell like the quality went down considerably also the portions got smaller servers are very attentive and the place always has a long line of people trying to get in ... they also have new items ... spicy this , spicy that : - ) i don 't mean to sound crazy but the people in the kitchen are not japanese anymore : )
asian	feels like a vegas wannabe vibe . the food however is nothing special . i can go to chinatown and get better quality food . you 're paying for the experience mostly .
asian	the food was good , and the people are alright . the food is cooked fresh when ordered . however for the price , i feel there should be more meat and veggies .
asian	the salad dressing tasted bad , and the worse was that i found a piece of tinsel in my salad . for the dynamite rolls , other restaurants they made them spicy , this restaurant i have to add $ 1.00 to make it spicy . if i order a spicy mayo aside it is only 50 cent . what a rip off . they copy new generation 's menu , ng 's lunch special cost $ 5.99 , they charge $ 6.99 ( $ 7.90 after tax ) . i can have much better meals at that price .
asian	been here for over 40 minutes waiting for my food and you know why it 's taking so long ? because our waiter is sitting across the empty restaurant from us eating with a bunch of other employees. if i wasn 't such a pussy cat i would leave haha. my food is okay : ) i also feel awful for leaving this bad review but you don 't ignore your customers ..
asian	ask for fried rice with your meal they give you chicken fried rice . its all thrown in in a hurry . the girl at the front desk doesnt speak english sooo how do expect to get it right . dont get me wrong the food is good but they just cant give you what you ordered .
asian	not great , but decent enough for me to come try again . the price was the main attractive point until recently , but overall it is still an okay deal compare to its competitors . there are lots of dishes for the buffet option , and honestly you might as well go with the buffet option ( compare to a la carte ) because your food will mostly come from there anyway .
asian	we were not interested in ordering fin soup and abalone , so the set dinners were unsuitable . as such , the menu was very inadequate . what we ended up ordering tasted good . pricing aside , i will not return to have a routine dinner . the restaurant does not seems to be interested in serving routine weekend family dinner that does not involve fin soup and abalone .
asian	.. not super kid friendly , we almost come here at a regular basis ( at least once a week ) . we always have to ask for booster seats ... to the point that i have started taking my own boosters today .... placed the order and the staff was not in his pleasant attitude , looked like he was annoyed by kids or just don 't like kids ... having been here many times , i am finally fed up to the point to write this review . food is decent but lots of work is needed for customer service .
asian	the problem with 24 / 7 places is the sanitation of the restaurant and the freshness of the food . i just came back from there because friends wanted to eat there and waited 30 + minutes for my pork , katsu and still didn 't come out because they forgot the order and it wasn 't even busy .
asian	first horrible meal . they changed their menu and must have changed the way they make their noodles . dandan noodles were returned . chewy starchy and not pleasant to eat . the pork lo mien was also returned . same reason . mongolian beef with broccoli was still awesome . tried pineapple pork from seasonal menu . just okay . should probably go back to the way it was .
asian	all the basics and done to a decent level until today . not sure if the cook was away but all the food was nuked - peppers still chilled and the gen tsao 's was soggy . should have realized something was up when quoted 10 mins for pick-up . oh well , will give them another go soon as convenient but if this happens again will go the extra 2 miles ( from home ) to jade palace - a 5 star emporium
asian	tonight was horrible . so bad i 'm never coming back . too many things to even list . and we were celebrating a birthday . told them that and still got horrible service .
asian	great prices , big selection , bad service . i was a customer until i got turned off my the main old lady in charge . i asked for a simple replacement of chicken that had too much sauce and she didn 't want to do it . eventually she did but gave a really bad attitude ; this is after coming many times . the teriyaki was ok. chicken was undercooked as i noted a few times . the main reason why i came here so much because it was cheap , close to my house , and only teriyaki place i knew . i found a few other places so this will no longer be my destination to satisfy my teriyaki cravings .
asian	tables are available but no one seems to want to clean them . dirty tables are always present when i come , yeah very appealing . a larger party came after us and got seated first . rude . food is ok . probably the last time i 'm coming here .
asian	it was busy to be expected at lunch time . i found it strange that no one ever came to take my name down to be on the waiting list for a table . i had to ask to get my name on the waiting list . communication became difficult when i could not communicate to the server if my soup was coming because mine was the only one not delivered . when my soup finally came , it was quite satisfying . i ordered what i thought only contained seafood , but i ended up having to fish out pork . that was my fault , i should have asked if it contained pork . other than that , it was quite satisfying .
asian	the decor was nice . easy to accomodate groups and spacious arrangement . that being said it 's a typical ayce fare but food was seriously lacking . everything on the hot table were lukewarm at best and it was slim pickings as fresh food was not being brought out . some dishes were too salty . tempura had too much batter . for buffet sushi , the sushi and sashimi was decent . service was slow as well . dishes piled up at the end of the the table and even though my party was able to communicate with the staff in mandarin , they should definitely hire some english speaking people . overall a less than subpar experience .
asian	came to pick up lunch around 215 and they close at 3 . for the last 45 minutes that the restaurant was opened they ignored their phones . finally we drove by around 240 and they had the open signs off and still answered no calls . the food is decent but this having happened more than once was unacceptable ... the customer service dictated this review .
asian	our server was accommodating and friendly . the sushi did not taste fresh and our hot saki was served cold . the atmosphere is rather drab . we left still hungry and dissatisfied . there are better sushi restaurants downtown .
asian	never had a problem . tonight i said the walnut chicken looked dry . complete ignore mode from the guy who was waiting on us . pressed him and he just said " we can 't do nothing . " at the register a flock of employees were congregating at a table eating . super unprofessional . gal who was waiting on me actually said " we like it when the manager is gone . " i replied , yep , it 's obvious no one is here minding the minions . visit 8-2-2017 time 7 : 00 p.m. suggestion : always have a manger present !
asian	we visit from denver and this year we ordered lechon kawali , pusit , bangus , and dinuguan . lechon kawali was good , but the pusit was dry and the bangus was cold . we went for lunch .
asian	everytime i come here someone in the group would order phud thai . this is the most inconsistent restaurant i 've been to . i decided to take a gamble and order the phud thai again after my last visit destroyed me with the extremely bland phud thai they served . today it was horrible , borderline disgustingly sour . so just be warned if your last visit was good ... it might not be the same the next time .
asian	been here several times and this last time was the worst .. bought a giga fries and the girl said it 'll be ready in 30 seconds .. = \ after she packaged the fries i left and when i got to my car ( which was around the corner ) they were completely stale and cold .. called the phone number to their location and the phone just kept on ringing .. finally got ahold of someone and she was just speechless on the phone .. literally speechless .. we were loyal customers but after this .. i don 't know if i 'll come back and support this business due to their customer service
asian	bland , blah generic food . went today for their " great " chinese food . horrible and very overpriced for it . the scallops and shrimp szechwan were soggy breaded yuck in sweet and sour sauce . the accompanying egg roll was greasy and soggy . won 't bother with eating at south point again as have been disappointed by every restaurant we have tried here . only decent food has been salads ; at the snack bar at the bowing alley , the del mar deli and the oyster bar .
asian	today bad service with no water refills . just not worth it in my mind .
asian	not very " authentic " either . but there 's not that much else around the area . the interior is pretty nice !
asian	excellent cooking table and sushi meals off the menu . tried the ayce menu . the quality was not nearly as good as the a la carte and other ayce sushi restaurants . service was terribly slow i thought i was in a fine dining restaurant !
asian	i always enjoyed the food . my fav : i used to always order the toonie uesday which i liked for a while . then i would feel sick after eating it . it never settled well in my somach . i think kfc needs less fat and oil . if they would improve this they would be amazing .
asian	the restaurant itself is nice , more upscale than your regular pho joint . service was better too , but oh the pho ... it lets me down every time . there seems to be something added to the broth itself that tastes different , but good . but the meat and noodles just aren 't right . egg rolls and spring rolls aren 't worth getting in my opinion , really some of the worst i 've had . like others have said the crème brulee is good tho
asian	it 's a fun experience and it is quite a feast , but i can 't really recommend the quality of the food .
asian	burgers and sushi aren 't bad , good at best . paying for the atmosphere and location not the quality of food .
asian	our food took more than half an hour to come and the server seemed more engrossed in watching tv than even offering to refill our glasses . don 't come here in the evenings ! ! . they 're just really stressed and will stress you out too .
asian	the first time the shrimp came out uncooked , i sent it back and it seemed fine . barely made it out of the restaurant before i had to rush to the restroom . the second time around , i had the same issue except also 24 hours of stomach cramps . a few other issues with service but minor compared to routine food poisoning .
asian	definitely i wouldn 't go for their udon as their broth is really salty . i tired it twice as i thought it could have just been that day . beef carpaccio is really good with the tart pomegranate seeds . quite original compare to other restaurants . s
asian	although they are cheaper than the other ayce in the area the quality of the sashimi is subpar and not very fresh . spend a few more bucks for better stuff its worth it .
asian	heard them in the ceiling on the first trip and sure enough my girlfriend saw them in the bathroom on the second trip . needless to say we got up and left without eating our food .
asian	both times the service has been really bad. one of the servers just kept walking past our table knowing that our drinks needed to be refilled . also saw that same server sneeze without covering her mouth . the second time we were there , i got very bad food poisoning , i know it 's not just me cuz the other people i was with had the same and we didn 't even share broths . i don 't think i can go there for a while , which makes it sad cuz i pass by it everyday .
asian	the food didn 't strike me as being overly fresh . the place had that all too common unappetizing stale fish smell that greets you when you walk in . the sushi combinations seemed very " 80 's " and outdated . on the upside , the service was good , the tvs were playing football . you could do worse , but you could also do a lot better .
asian	both times they took the egg from my tray and put it in the other bowl at our table even though the bowls were on separate trays . when you have food allergies , this is a problem . liked the food , just not confident they can take care of food allergies well .
asian	first time service was good and food was fine . staff could put more effort into explaining how the ayce process works . last visit knocked two stars off their rating in my view . service was slow and rude . they forgot a couple of our items and when we inquired as to the whereabouts you 'd think it was a huge imposition . for a place not very busy on a friday night i give this place under six months . sorry memories of japan i used to be a fan but not anymore .
asian	it 's american sushi for the most part , and a lot of sauce used which is a turn off . service was unfriendly and scattered both times . the one thing i really liked was the lack of ayce which can bring me down ! place could use a good scrub down .
asian	" if i wanted load music and dinner , i would go to a bar or club , then they have someone singing karaoke that just ruined my dinner , saw 3 tables get up after the singing started and i wanted to leave too , but my party wasn 't done eating . if they continue this i can see them losing alot of business , probably will never come back again , even if they were the last vietnamese restaurant in this world .
asian	the purple rice they use and some of the rolls are amazing but i would steer away from fried rice it was bland and the teriyaki chicken was a disappointment . stick to the sushi and sashimi they are where this place shines however due to service and poor quality on the non-sushi items my rating is two stars
asian	the staff made a good effort , but alas they were unprofessional . the food was slightly less than mediocre , but it was prepared and served pretty quick . if you 're looking for authentic and delectable asian cuisine , this is not the place . but , if you 're in the area and need a quick , reasonably priced meal with large portions wai wai is your gem .
asian	this time , i even found a sliver of hair in the soup i ordered .
asian	i have tried the pad thai , green curry chicken with the roti , fried rice , yellow curry beef with roti and bunch of platters . the roti itself is good at $ 2 each- they are big and fresh . this place is on the pricey side and i dislike the parking lot . also , i am not a fan of resturants that are dark . the wait time at this place can be long especially on weekends . oh yah , and they do not allow reservation so you should call in before you go .
asian	after comparing lunch and dinner my results were very similar . the food is not the greatest . a few entrees tasted old / stale , lunch entrees left out for dinner at night possibly ? and yes ! cockroaches , i was eating and one ran across my table infront of my plate . there was one also at the end of the table by the soy sauce salt / pepper area more than likely were crawling on top of them . where there 's one there 's many more elsewhere .
asian	most recent experience was awful , first was not memorable either . this time the restaurant smelled strongly of sewage , so much that if i was not with co-workers i would 've walked out . disgusting . i ordered the vegetarian pho which was served with 2- yes only 2- pieces of tofu . broth was flavourless and lukewarm . will not be returning . for a better vietnamese experience try pho saigon .
asian	got sick the first time within a couple hours of eating . thought we 'd give it another try again tonight and see and i was sick again . would not recommend . have eaten at several other places in town and not had an issue . not sure what it is about this place . i wanted to like it but i can 't .
asian	the food is decent but the second time i went i got food poisoning ... what else is there to say .
asian	definitely not a fan because of the horrible service . wait times are ridiculous and the staff seems to be all over the place . nobody knows their roles or what to do in general . food is eh .. you get what you pay for with the price . quality is just not there for me and some of the meats have a weird , pungent smell to them -- noticeable in the porks . they also don 't serve steamed egg , no big deal but what a turn off . ¯ \ _ ( ツ ) _ / ¯ i rather make the 30-40 minute drive all the way to chinatown and be satisfied with a legit kbbq restaurant , not a wanna-be .
asian	the decor encompasses all the cheap japanese type of knick knacks that make the place look extremely cluttered . they have private booths where you have to " ring " a bell which i find tacky . of recently i got a spicy salmon roll which is usually a sure bet however i was presented with a gigantic deep fried mess .
asian	don 't think i will be back here again as both times we have been here , an order of ours gets to our table stone cold . the first time we had been here , our tea order was freezing cold . the second time , we had ordered spring rolls which were cold and looked as if it had been sitting out for a while as it was really greasy . the waitresses are not attentive and just stand at the back . you have to stare or waive one down in order to be served . we ordered the japanese fried chicken as well which was good . we then ordered the volcano ramen , which the broth tastes too powdery for my liking .
asian	the " garlic chicken " was just fried chicken breast with garlic powder poured on it . went to use the bathroom and so far was the dirtiest bathroom i 've been in since i moved here . guess i 'm gonna try and find a real hawaiian place out here . i do no recommend .
asian	we decided to go here again to bring a friend who 's never tried sushi before .. when getting there we had to wait 45 min. outside to get our table , finally after getting seated waiter asked us for our drinks very rudely .. through out our whole dinner the waiters were giving us bad vibes and after a few orders told us we passed our limit and isn 't going to serve us anymore ... not only that made us wait 20 min. for our check ... i think they should have kept serving us since it 's all you can eat and we were waiting anyways but whatevs .. really good food but service is terrible .
asian	the staff was very unfriendly , not even saying welcome , or how are you today ? the food itself was okay , nothing worth going back for , but not something that i wanted to walk out over either . the only real redeeming item was the rice pudding that my husband had for desert . overall not a place that i would tell people to go to .
asian	here , it was fairly decent , but overpriced . but i suppose given their location i can understand why . my husband got the bimbimbap which he thought was also overpriced especially for the one small piece of meat it came with . will be back when i get the craving but not very frequently given the cost .
asian	the orange chicken was bad . my kids love orange chicken . do you hear me ? ! they love orange chicken . we got extra orange chicken because we knew that they would destroy it , yet it was left barely touched . the beef and broccoli was just okay , kind of had an odd taste to it . the only thing that i really enjoyed was the fried rice . that stuff was amazing which is the reason for the 2 stars . unless i am craving some fried rice , i doubt that i will ever be back .
asian	made an order at 10 : 20pm on a friday night and received an " i guess i can take your order " greeting comment . well , i guess i will take my business elsewhere .
asian	it 's hit or miss 50 / 50 chance of it being good . i 'm assuming they have one cook who knows what he doing . the rest of them just throw things in a pan . i have gotten the same mix of veggies for dishes that don 't even call for it . on top of that they were basically all same .. lol what 's the point of having options when they all taste the same . thanks for this dry beef mein that i had to doctor myself to even want to eat it .. tasteless need to get a grip on your cooks ! ! ! !
asian	crazy , right ? best part is , it was the wrong order . call and we 're told " uh , can 't you just eat that one ? " uh , no ! finally convince them to send a new order . it arrives 35 minutes later . i don 't even get a sorry and they asked for the wrong food back . luckily just eat stepped up and refunded our money . this will be my last order .
asian	i called back to get her name to speak to manager she didn 't answer from my number used a different phone she answered and hung up .. ordered from here at least once a week , never again ! lazy last minute fuckers ! !
asian	a gloppy curry sauce around a few onions and re peppers with a couple of dozen heavily breaded bits of mystery meat . other than the curry there was no flavour of beef or peanuts . whoever looks after flavour at this place was on vacation . the szechuan noodles weren 't . the bbq egg foo yong was scrambled eggs and bean sprouts . why can 't i find a decent chines food delivery place in this huge city that has a smattering of knowledge of chinese food and quality
asian	not that good to be honest but quick and hot . tough meats and crummy quality proteins but hey , those cats and stray dogs don 't cook themselves . the delivery guy used to break his neck " casing " out my apartment while i signed the bill . i order from fujo now like an adult with money .
asian	made an order yesterday and it was perfect . ordered today from the same address and was given a jacked up delivery fee . asked to speak to a manager and surprise ! there was none available . terrible treatment of their loyal customer .
asian	mr wing , people might ask you questions , please don 't raise your voice to them like you did to me . i 'll never come back and i 'll be sure to tell my friends . hope you feel better now .
asian	coupled with the fact that this place is tough to find or see from mayo ... food finally got there . udon was ok but roll had sauce that was just straight mayonnaise . not quick , not cheap , and more trouble than it 's worth cleaning chemical on hosted stand while i waited was nice to look at
asian	the 2nd time was take out . i must warn you this restaurant cheat on us .. they put all the left bones from previous customer on our overpeking duck take out ... 2nd meal was supposed to be meat cooked etc from the duck but we only got the bones in 2 boxes . bad people who did this ... will never go back again .
asian	both times the sushi rice was stale and sauces were bland . menu on the website did not match the one in the restaurant . good selection for happy hour though , even though food just ok and not worth the regular prices beyond happy hour .
asian	mine had 5 pieces of lettuce and the sauce to dump over was not enough to wet the dish . always order the summer rolls , the peanut sauce isn 't enough to use with 2 rolls , we ordered extra and they charged is $ 1 . we also ordered 2 summer roll orders and one had shrimp the other just pork . this food is cheep to make so i 'm thinking they need to bulk up the lettuce dishes and make it a true meal .
asian	the people are nice , but they do not have enough help . was there last week and one girl helped 7 customers with their food and ringing them up. after a while , a cook showed up to cook , but she had to do double duty during the lunch rush . also , there is never enough sauce on the entrees . it 's like dry breading on the orange chicken , sesame chicken etc . i 'll try it one more time , but after that - no more !
asian	we won 't be back . we did the full hungary thai experience . i had the cabbage rolls . ok , a nice dry . my dc had the tofu goreng and she was not pleased . they had dos equis ( a plus ) but a shady and cold patio ( a minus ) . service has friendly but the food is too expensive .
asian	waitress not very friendly ( but cookers bearing large friendly smiles ) . have been sick the following night. will never go back .
asian	their food and service were good at that time , but last three time visit was horrible . food tasting was pretty good and lunch special is also good , but the service was very uncomfortable . the server always looked angry , always didnt bring some stuffs and even showed attitude to us . there was hair in a soup , so we complained . we didnt eat at all , but they just charged all food cost with 10 % comp . we didnt say anything since we thought we are regular customers . anyway i wont go back , ban chan 1mile up there food taste and service is much better
asian	and don 't bother trying to make a to go order because calling 4times isn 't enough to answer . great place lol
asian	the food is average at best and definitely way overpriced . they also aren 't great at explaining their spice levels ( american spicy or thai spicy ) so my food was not spicy enough . go to thai thai instead .
asian	it 's ok , but have had better at other places including other pei wei 's . the last straw was when they didn 't put lettuce in our take out order for the wraps . not driving back 4 miles for friggin lettuce . i called and the young lady was very apologetic , and offered to send me a coupon if i would give my address , which i did . several weeks later , no coupon . oh well i 'm only one customer they 've lost .
asian	didn 't go back since than but i was craving for roti so i decided to give it another try . second time i ordered chicken roti with extra sauce ( it was good ) . third time i went back and got a beef roti ( dry , hard and luke warm ) . i think they gave me a beef roti that was sitting there for a while that someone didn 't pick up . would have given them 1 star but the girls at the counters were awesome .
asian	the first two , the food was quite good but the service was very slow and mediocre . after the last time i ate there , september 10 , 2015 , i woke up early the next morning and vomited massaman chicken for the next 4 hours . am i sure it was the food ? hmmmm , not positive , but pretty sure , and i know i 'll never eat there again !
asian	i was there for about an hour and majority of my time there was waiting for food cause everything was empty . tried to look for the manager and there 's no where to be found . i had 2 left over california rolls and red snappers . i decided to video tape the place with all the empty plates . too bad i can 't upload the video here . i felt bad for taking my kids and wife there for lunch . definitely will be our last .
asian	i know people who rave about this place and i am still trying to figure out why . korean food generally has so many powerful flavour explosions happening in your mouth - the garlic , the green onion , regular onion , chili , sesame oil , shiso , etc . , but this place for me tastes like korean hospital food . truly does not do it for me .
asian	the food is greasy and of poor quality . meals arrive cold .... servers are super busy and harried. if you want to sip a drink and watch the water it 's still good , but not for a meal . much better places in the neighbourhood .
asian	last time i ordered general tso 's chicken but they have a different idea of what ' chicken ' is than i do . every chunk of ' chicken ' i cut into looked like a wad of skin and some kind of foreign substaince i could not identify . i could not eat any of it and was totally grossed out . my wife warned me not to try it a second time but i thought ' you can 't mees up chineese food ! ' . but boy was i wrong and how right she was .
asian	the food tasted old and they even heated up the food in the microwave in front of us ... also very dirty , should have left right away
asian	the food was not terrible but definitely nowhere close to being authentic or good . however , the service was the worst . this waiter gave me a small ladle to eat pho . and when i asked for a normal soup spoon , he said that he didnt know " what is a normal spoon . " when i asked for a smaller spoon , he got irritated and gave me the to-go plastic spoon ! ! ! very rude and unprofessional . i will never recommend this restaurant to anybody , nor will i ever come back to this place .
asian	it is a breakfast steak ! ! ! ! go buy some from local japanese supplier and cook for yourself . automatic charged 25 % tip ! ! ! ! terrible service too , no reaction to whatever you suggest . all in all , no taste , no class. just wait to get your money .
asian	been there twice , try their bun bo hue , the size is small and expensive. poor service. other pho downstreet is even better and cheapper .
asian	sub-par ingredients . cucumber salad was bland , but the seaweed salad was tasty ( normal ) . rolls were loose , rice was chewy . i picked a piece of salmon out of a roll and ate it by itself , and realized why the roll did nothing for me - the salmon was bland . this place isn 't cheap enough for how cheap the food tastes , so i 'll pay slightly more for better sushi elsewhere .
asian	one of the worst experiences . bad service , we signaled we need service but nobody came for a long time until one of us went to the counter . no asking about if we are satisfied with the food or flavor at all . the worst was the bad food . all of us had diarrhea symptom and one of us even vomited . will never go again and not recommended .
asian	food is below average quality with lots of oil ! and naan bread was dry and hard . it 's not value for money place , and we decided never to go there again .
asian	i paid $ 32 for dinner and quickly noticed that they had no salmon ? they did serve yellowtail , which is unusual for todai but no salmon . i also love uni but they did not have that either ! so i figured i would more than make up for the price by gorging on crab legs . but the crab legs were old and chalky . yuk ! no flavor at all . i know what to expect at todai but this particular one was very disappointing . if you are ever in honolulu , that todai is the absolute best i 've ever had .
asian	awesome food and flavor luv the green curry , my fav .... i will be a regular in this establishment ! ( 1st time review ) 2nd visit .... me and my wife went here again , sure the food was delicious but you insulted me and my wife running at and chasing us at the parking lot saying that we didn 't pay it was absolutely embarrasing ! well the credit card receipt showed my wife 's signature on it and pointed at it , make sure to pay attention to detail next time and avoid embarrasing your costumer . oh btw i found a much better thai restaurant - kung fu thai & chinese at chinatown ! ! !
asian	not so here . don 't go here on sunday afternoons . slow service ( owner was talking on his cell phone next to front door & one female server ) , food was so / so . not kid friendly either . no cheater chopsticks . bbq beef was more fat than meat . pho was average . curry beef was spicy , but more sauce than beef .
asian	been to archi 's for years , waited tonight for along time without even a glass of water , finally got up walked out and goto applebee , they have wonderful server there ... it 's not the owner 's fault , but with terrible servers ... if i can 't count on the restaurant who have a standard of good service , will not bring any other friends there ...
asian	i got the beijing za jiang noodles and it was absolutely terrible . the sauce was extremely bland and watery , the noodles were of poor texture and overall just inaccurate . please dont order this , me and my friend had one bite each before we gave up .
asian	we tried the pho , hainan chicken , pad thai and curry beef . all of them were average . service was very good and food came out super fast . other than that there is nothing special about this place to make me return a second time . rating : service : 4 / 5 food quality : 3 / 5 comfort 3 / 5 decor 2 / 5 value : 3 / 5 parking : 3 / 5
asian	the menu posted here online is totally different from their menu . tempura oily , grilled steak and pork , dry smothered in the same out of the bottle teriyaki all told never will go back . dessert one little moche small ice cream disappointed for the money .
asian	i will never come back here again . ordered the combination chow mein . the meat is marinated in baking soda ? that 's the explanation i got when i called and asked them why the meat was so squishy and flavorless . second time here giving it a chance . this will be my last .
asian	my husband and i were sick one night and wanted something warm . i placed the order online and my husband went to pick it up . ordered a pesto cavatappi and a thai hot pot . chose no mushrooms for the hot pot . when my husband picked up he confirmed with the cashier that there were no mushrooms . however once we got home there were a lot of mushrooms that he had to remove . more than usual . called to let them know they offered to make a new one but we are 20 min away and didn 't want to make another drive there . manager offered to send coupons but two weeks later they haven 't come . disappointing .
asian	i have been here a few times and the most recent time i have eaten there i got food poisoning . a good restaurant should never give a individual any kind of sickness .
asian	the pho also lacks noodles there being tight with the noodles , also the steak in the pho was rubbery i 'm glad they only put 2 slices in pho what the heck cheap . the pho was not greatest very disappointing after craving pho for awhile . service not bad . i won 't be coming back here i will continue to look for great pho .
asian	been to many thai places , service at this one is rude and slow , more expensive then most other places and small portions , forget it , dont easte your money !
asian	got the crab fried rice and rad nar . very little crab meat and the rice taste bland . rad nar comes with so little noodles and all gravy . the taste is surprisingly sour ? ! ? paid $ 15 for each dish and got 10 % discount with cash payment . overall food is very bad and overpriced . they do have entertainment at 9p . absolutely avoid this place as there are many more authentic and tastier thai restaurants nearby .
asian	i guess i made the mistake of getting there right when they opened , mixed veggies were not done yet , so i waited .. took a bite of broccoli and noticed a strange flavor .. didn 't think much about it then took a huge bite of mixed veggies that where all stuck together with this waxy white substance . ( that i didn 't notice ) .... gross it coated my mouth and tasted horrible ... showed it to the clerk she asked me if i wanted something else ... haha not from here .. i 'm currently feeling sort of sick . be careful this is not the norm for panda in vegas. so gamble on this location if you want . goodluck !
asian	bathrooms were a wreck , i noticed they were in the middle of remodeling but that doesn 't mean they shouldn 't be clean . tables were left covered with dishes after people left and not wiped down . garbage all over the floors while the waitstaff sat at a table . i seen a cook come out of the bathroom with an apron on , a bit unsanitary . does anyone take pride in their work anymore ?
asian	incomparable with the others . they 've cut down the menu by a lot , and the food was extremely bland . had the baked pork chops with spaghetti and tomato sauce , literally taste like plain spaghetti with canned tomato soup . the pork chop wasn 't great either , super hard and dry . would not come back
asian	been to other teriyaki madness and all other places much better than this location u could see the workers planing around in the back food was not that great in this location
asian	the food quality was in no competition to the other locations . really poor quality . got a green thai curry and it lacked in the amount of sauce and vegetables . sushi rolls were falling apart . would not go back to that location .
asian	nigiri was below average , ( too much fat from a lean salmon and tuna ) , maki rolls were ok ... there are better restaurants out there for the same cost . people were nice though !
asian	on my last visit , found a pubic hair in my soup and no apologies from the server or management . this is how to chase away customers for good .
asian	the buffet the first time was fresh , hot and the value good . the second time it took us 15 minutes to get our drinks , some of the sushi was drying out , all of the fried food was greasy , the meat gamey and overall the food was not at all appetizing . the first experience was a solid b , the second was a straight up failure . there was a " now hiring " sign in front we noticed on our way out ( wish we 'd been paying more attention while entering ) . one has to wonder what position is being filled . we won 't be back and will not recommend this buffet to anyone .
asian	food trays only have little bits of dried up food in them and they always try and serve it to you and if you ask for fresh you get a crazy look from the servers and then they tell you it will be 10 minutes . always long lines so why can 't they keep fresh food up .
asian	however this time around we bought a few things and not all items made it to the plastic bag to take home tried calling them at least a dozen times and no one ever picked up the phone . so be it that 's just a small item but it 's just the fact that they can 't even pick up and answer the phone once ? would 've just taken a few seconds if their time ...
asian	the food is very disappointing . i have tried the pho : little meat , little flavour , not the right taste . but pho was a better choice than anything fried , like the sweet and sour chicken or salt and pepper chicken or anything of that sort : there is barely any meat , mostly flour , and the little meat that there is is dry . the portion is not that bad though . the service was ok , nothing extraordinary . two stars because of the cheap price and the 10 % for students . the waiter even let me have it once when i forgot my student id . quite nice . but i would avoid it as much as possible .
asian	but customer service is terrible . the server , also the cashier never seems to smile and is rude . i placed an order today by telephone and stated i would be there in 10 minutes . the server agreed it would be ready for pick up . when i arrived , she seemed surprised and no order was even placed . i had to wait unnecessarily in a restaurant that was already packed . she did not even apologize . rude beyond belief .
asian	with new owner 's , the food was terrible , portion size of the salmon was terribly small and very dry for $ 10.00 lunch . will never go back ! !
asian	today we went for lunch and my husband took one sip of his water and said it tasted funny so i took one big gulp and almost vomit ! ! ! the cup was absolutely filty and had white stuff floating all over them . i mention to the server and she informed me that maybe it was sugar ... sugar ! ! ! really ! ! ! i don 't care what was in it they should not bring us water with remains from their last customer ! i will never go back to this place again ! ! !
asian	last visit was very disappointing . we were party of four . as usual not the friendliest greeting . we ordered few beers , chilli chicken , house special fried rice and chilli beef . food came out almost immediately , as it was pre made . chilli chicken was cold and dry . other items were ok . probably i will try different place next time .
asian	we literally had to order sashimi 3 times before it came out . there were missing orders and we continuously had to reorder items ! ! never returning here , there are plenty of ayce sushi , this place must 've been the slowest and bad service . food was mediocre .
asian	tried the sunday luncheon buffet and was not impressed at all . sadly , anything with pasta ( pad thai and a wide noodle dish ) was gummy and stuck together , not edible . all other protein choices were primarily chicken dishes which all pretty much tasted the same . the mussels were good but again , overall , not much variety . there was a crowd so the food being served disappeared quickly . saw the server initially to take a drink order and never saw again . had to walk over to the register to pay .
asian	the last time however ( 4 / 17 / 15 ) i got severe food poisoning . i had the crunchy roll , spicy tuna , and shrimp tempura . it made for the worst flight back home possible .
asian	just got takeout , and the lady that took my order just kept yelling " what else , " should 've known from the start . got the gold standard general tso 's chicken . in one word , disappointing . 3 pieces of small breaded chicken and the rest was giant pieces of raw green pepper . they obviously try to make this dish seem large without putting any substance into it . the hot & sour soup was on point , the rest of the meal was about par . tl ; dr better off going somewhere else
asian	the service was nice and fast . however , the food was not that yummy . the beef roll was hot on the outside and cold on the inside . we also had a soup that i really didn 't care for ... may be because of my personal taste . however , one would expect the dumplings to be good , but they were disappointing . chicken or pork it doesn 't matter ... tastes the same . at least it was cheap .
asian	it 's been always my first choice for sushi but i was really disappointed for their customer service tonight . i ordered a chicken teriyaki dinner and other menu items but ended up getting a half cooked chicken . i had to drive all the way back to pick up the same food and i 'm not 100 % sure if they 're really sorry about what they had done . they ruined my dinner schedule . but they didn 't offer anything but a replacement . what a great service !
asian	then she walked away . i guess they didn 't care for my business . 10 : 18pm ... finally just set us up . now we have to wait for the soup to boil ....
asian	the chicken was extremely bland and dry . the rice was extremely oily . was not impressed at all and on top of that the customer service was extremely poor . however if you want to go to the restaurant for their interior then i will give them credits for that they have done a nice job with it but other then that would definitely not be going back . i 'd rather go to paramount . this place was extremely overly priced and definitely not worth it .
asian	dropped in and had appetizers to see what all the hype was about . singapore sling - amazing popcorn chicken - salty af . shrimp toast - salty af . took one bite of each and was immediately turned off . didn 't bother ordering the chicken rice for fear of more salt . if it wasn 't for our server i 'd give this place 1 star . she was very attentive and offered to have them remake our dishes . after we kindly declined she took the dishes off our bill . i may try again . hopefully it will be seasoned correctly .
asian	what a disappointment . i was warned that the fish was frozen but sometimes i 'm not super picky about that , at least if the batter is good . this is not the case here . gross , bland , only redeeming quality was the iced tea . i 'm frankly shocked that a business that started in 1947 and has this crappy quality food is still in business . i love to eat at local , family run businesses , but will never be back .
asian	the food was good but our server was not so great . it took her long periods of times to bring back drinks and such . we asked for a childrens menu when we sat down and it took 34 minutes for her to come back empty handed and we had to ask her again . they only thing i could say about the food was i wish they would bring the dishes out all together instead of staggered apart .
asian	don 't be deceived by the delicious smell , the spicy edamame is truly just good smelling salt ! maybe a great tool for your next hunting trip !
asian	they waved but makes you wonder ... think the positive reviews are based on price and not quality . hoping i don 't get sick tonight . guess that 's what sake is for !
asian	i spent a few years in korea and loved these places while i was out there . this place excited me coming in but disappointed me on the way out . don 't think i 'll be back .
asian	before coming in my mom kept going on about how they have changed owners and she was worried about the food might not be as good anymore. i then prepared myself for this bias and figured if i think the food is bad , it might just be my mom. but the food was objectively bad. so bad that the shrimp chips were old and stale and the duck soup just tasted like water. they charged extra for the tortilla to eat the duck with. we ordered the duck three way and everything was so bland and no one was full , but we ordered a couple of side dishes and it tasted just as bad. avoid .
asian	my buddy keep talking about this place she found on yelp . i was already skeptical about this place but i always try to keep a open mind . this interior decoration was horrible . nothing on there menu look appetizing . i decided to be safe and just order the rice dish with bbq pork and roast pork . it wasn 't bad but nothing special either . would i be back ! no ! ! !
asian	before i came here , friends told me service is very bad , i told them i don 't mind , as long as the food is good , but after i got here with my kids , i realized service really horrible , not worth it
asian	the decor at this place is nice , environment is clean , and service is good ... the quantity of food is decent , but the quality is ... meehh . noodles were over-cooked . broth is bland . chashu is worse than amateur . egg is not cooked very well either . it is very nice to see pittsburgh to have a dedicated ramen place ; however , this place needs to get serious about the food . if you are craving for a hot soup in a cold day , this might be a good place to go .
asian	service was decent . i would not recommend any of their pho based noodle soups . they are for people who have no taste buds . their pho has let me down many times . there is no flavor in their broth . it 's basically like hot water . it wasn 't even worthy of a photo like all the other ramen pictures i 've posted . so far the only dish i find tolerable is their pad see ew which is almost like a pad thai . but other than that i would not come here for pho . total disappointment . they need to improve their broth ! ! !
asian	the server 's answer was " yes . " hard to believe , as the soups were unlike any goulash we 've ever had : no meat , only slices of overcooked carrots and celery and five hard , flour dumplings . the thin broth tasted of nothing but cayenne and salt . down the garburator !
asian	she said it will be " in ten minutes . " so i put my order in . i was waiting on the counter standing . i was asked 3 times by different staff what i ordered . my order did not arrive til almost 20minutes later ! i saw them scrambling for my order . it sounded like they got my spicy wei order wrong ; it wasnt spicy or they forgot to add spicy sauce .. i was visibly upset and they apologized but i had to run to my departure gate !
asian	we tried this place because it was close and got tired of driving down to 7th street for pei wei or flamingo palace . the pork fried rice was decent , the house chicken was not at all good and the chicken lo mein was simply terrible and for this less-than-mediocre food you pay more than pei wei and approaching p.f. changs . next time i want typical chinese fair , i 'll drive the extra few miles to flamingo .
asian	one look at the glass door and i knew this restaurant was not clean . why did i eat here anyway ? i was meeting a party and couldn 't say " no . " i ordered vegetarian given my concerns . food was average and i know various asian types of food pretty well . the biggest mistake i made was going to the restroom . absolutely disgusting and clearly is never serviced . i will not be back .
asian	the service , which used to be top notch , is now abysmal . the food , while still being pretty good , isn 't nearly as good as it used to be . they changed their supplier , or changed the type of ingredients they use . either way it is to their detriment . this used to be my favorite place to get asian fare and i 'm saddened to say i probably won 't go back .
asian	if the dining room is even close to full ... leave and come back another time . we 've eaten there several times because our kids dig it . if you 're there say ... on a friday night at about 7pm , forgetaboutit . the staff is usually rude but the food is good . if they are busy , the staff is still rude but the food might be delivered cold . there 's gotta be a better place than this .
asian	with juicy pieces of pork with chicharon and egg . now , their sisig seem made from pork ledlftover from other dishes since it was so dry . the little mayo-esque frugally drizzled on top failed to give the dish any flavor . to finish this not so great experience , their additional cup of rice was barely a cup and cost 2.50 . this would be last time eating at this restaurant .
asian	ordered a bowl of beef noodle soup with roasted / pan fried pork . the middle soup was ordinary run of the mill stuff and would get three stars in my books , but the pork was disastrous . it was so charred that i could not finish half of it ( see picture ) . how is it okay to serve pork like this ? maybe it is three stars for noodle soups , but do not order the toasted / pan fried meats .
asian	the dumplings are perfectly seasoned reasonably priced amazing morsels of goodness . back then you were allotted unlimited sour cream , a soda , and of course your 20 dumplings for $ 5 . the spicy dumplings were a bi or tri weekly meal for quite a while . however now that the new owner has taken over , they now charge extra for soda , have unpredictable hours , sometimes just don 't have potato dumplings , and ( most insulting ) i found a stray beef dumpling in my potato . ack . i may never return .
asian	now the food is just watered down . we ordered 2 different curries and it was watery and no flavor and tasted the same . then tom kha soup was bland . overall , not a good thai place pros : service cons : food
asian	perfectly delicious ... and then that one fateful day , i received my order and nothing was the same ... the pork and chicken dinners looked exactly alike and were the worst tasting dishes i could remember eating . never again ...
asian	kumpai 's was awesome ! ! i had been going there for years . now that it 's sushi ave it kinda sucks . the waitress kept ignoring us and when i asked her how the tataki was made she just said i don 't know . didn 't ask a sushi chef nothing , just i don 't know . this place definitely isn 't my top pick . the food is pretty good but the service sucks .
asian	however , our meal ( while delicious ) , gave me horrible food poisoning . i had the lemon chicken , egg fried rice and a few crab puffs so not quite sure who the actual culprit is . i hate to leave a bad review , but i won 't give it a chance again .
asian	the restaurant was empty except for us and the table of horrible women and the waitress attempted to sit us right behind them until one of the women said something to her . the waitress who seemed very nice let us know the woman was talking badly about us but instead of saying something to her she asked us to move . i thought about it for a second and let them know we wouldn 't be ordering . i 'm appalled at the way we were treated and how it was handled . i was very excited to try this place out since we eat out a lot and love some of the other noodle houses in town but we won 't be back .
asian	what ? ? how the heck can you have no vegetables at an asian food place ? so then i decide to order the firecracker . i choose pork because it already has bacon listed as an ingredient . she tells me they no longer serve pork , yes they know it 's still on the menu , but no they do not serve pork anymore . again i have to ask , how can you call yourself an asian food place when you do not serve pork ! ! ? ? walked out and had chipotle next door . would give this place zero stars if i could !
asian	by the way , i brought it to there attention after i seen what was on my plate and , the server comes out and says i 'm sorry , would you like another plate of the same ? wtf ? ? ! ! yea buddy , how about on the same plate ! ! idiot . never again . gotta let the health department know now beings how nobody wants to take my info . i 'm not looking for a " free meal . " just want them to know how there so called restaurants run . ( like we didn 't already know ) .
asian	we asked them about it , the manager told us is was required , it 's rediculs , never come back again ! ! !
asian	they promise 5 minutes but can take 20 to prepare . wrong order items are a possibility too .
asian	before you walk through the door , read the notes from the latest health inspection report !
asian	i was told by my friend in toronto they had a fabulous noodles even better in toronto . i have order the beef belly noodles . the noodles was fine but the meat not tasty at all . will never try again .
asian	i ordered chicken satay , chicken green curry , coconut sticky rice and stir fry noodles . the food is pretty bland and satay was basically a fried chicken with not much taste . i 've had many green curries but this was average and not appealing to my taste buds . the place is pricey but doesn 't hurt if you come out satisfied ! cost for 2 : $ 55 will go back go ? : not really !
asian	this place doesn 't , they add way too much vinegar makes every roll taste the same ! also , the tempura ( pumpkin tempura rolls for example ) tastes like it was made days ago , stale and very hard , i even put the rollin my mouth and went to the washroom to spit it out , it was that bad . please , fix your tempura and don 't use soo much vinegar in your rice !
asian	they are not courteous and friendly . they can only hold the reservation for 5 mins . the restaurant is very tiny . its fire hazardous . since they are very popular , they should extend their restaurant and have some kind of reservation agent for booking . this is such a task for us in the industry as well as for our guests .
asian	came around 9pm for late dinner and only 3 / 7 tables were full - the place is quite small . the lady serving us spoke in cantonese and was very attentive . however , i was unimpressed by the lack of spice and seasoning in the skewers and wings . lamb and beef were mediocre , cabbage was burnt , and wings were ridiculously small . also , quite pricey for what you get . don 't think i 'll be back for another visit .
asian	so decided to try this one out . first looks ruined my appetite . the restaurant is super small with a few tables and not a good place if you are a group more than 4 . the items on the menu are limited and 13 $ for a buffet is a bit too expensive . i would rather prefer the 8 $ saffron restaurant . the items tasted okay but a costly one . if you are on a friends ' treat try this one . don 't try it on your own . remember , they serve on paper plates
asian	as soon as we sat down and ordered our food came out straight away , even before our drinks , as if it was already made in the back and just sitting there . we also felt a bit rushed by the staff , as far as the food goes i was a big fan of the singapore salad but the rest of the food fell flat .
asian	the quality was good , but wasn 't satisfied with my order in terms of taste and temperature of my dishes . i was very disappointed with the high price my meal for me and my wife . $ 50 for 2 appetizers and 2 bowls of udon seemed quite high ... especially leaving hungry ... $ 20 more and i could do all you can eat udon and sushi at goyemon ...
asian	unfortunately , the food quality is definitely below average . ordered the korean beef rice and pork neck with egg for lunch . portion was decent however both dishes lacked flavour . bland and boring ... probably won 't be returning because there are much better cafes at the same price or less
asian	it was overpriced and the fish wasn 't very fresh . we got a variety of dishes off the menu , none of which i loved . everything we ordered had spicy mayonnaise on it . things we ordered : tuna tataki , neo tokyo roll , spicy tuna cutroll , and the salmon avocado cutroll . even the drinks weren 't that great : ( great ambiance , however !
asian	my search led me to sushi-kim . oh how i wish it led me astray . this was probably one of the worst tasting korean barbecue places i have ever been to . the beef was not the right color and was basically bland . the beef short-ribs were tasty but was way too tough . i felt like i had to chew each piece 100x or i was going to choke and die . i was not a fan of the food at all and would not recommend it to anyone .
asian	service was very slow , but the people were nicer . i got a roast pork on rice and almost everything was pure fat , like 20 % meat at max . they were even trying . i was also not a fan of how their sauce was poured so it would sog up the crispy skin but not be able to make it to your rice . i think i 'm going back to my usual place from now on .
asian	the atmosphere did not make the food appealing . it was in an what looked like an abandoned shopping center . ordered the tom yum soup and chicken pad thai . both dishes were more sweet that savory . overall wasn 't impressed .
asian	so what i had at nani gives me about 40 percent satisfaction to my crave for dim sum , the cuisine that i had eaten every week for many years back home . and because of such disappointment on how not authentic the dim sum is , i didn 't even bother to go back after a few times . but if you are not from hong kong , theres a good chance that you will enjoy them more than me .
asian	i have had the chance to compare the selection and prices at ip as well as other markets on spring mountain rd and find that the selection is greater and prices are lower at the other markets . however , for filipino items , ip has a far greater selection .
asian	i use my yelp app to look for locations near me . i came across this place . the majority ads were very negative , but i thought give them a chance . unfortunately i should 've paid attention to the other review . i will not say the food was disgusting , but it was not very good whatsoever . i ordered the house egg for young ( sp ) with an order of fried rice . that egg foo young was soaking with the oil it was prepared with . the rice in the fried rice was burnt . people , i would just say read the reviews first . blessings .
asian	being the number 2 pho place according to blog to , i wanted a hearty bowl of noodle soup especially since it was raining . i was quite disappointed in this place . the broth was pretty tasty although it definitely has msg . i always figured i can adjust the taste a bit with the hoisin sauce , sriracha , and lemon . the noodles were overcooked . the meats were a little tough . even the rare beef felt tough and chewy . how is that even possible ? i probably won 't go to this place again , at least not for pho . and , i definitley not recommend this place to my parents . on with the search for pho ...
asian	i went back again last week for lunch and about an hour later , i threw up . later on , i realized that i had food poisoning from the dish that i had . it couldn 't have been anything else that i ate before because all i had before that was oatmeal for breakfast , which i have every morning . that day , i threw up 5 times , every time with a bit of the food that i had . i will never again eat at this place ever . i probably got food poisoning from either uncleanliness and or improper food handling of raw meat .
asian	we ordered delivery and the food arrived on time but completely cold and with no silverware . we 're staying in a hotel so that made it difficult to eat some of our food . the food itself not so great , which was really disappointing because i love their concept and everything sounds delicious . definitely not worth the money . i don 't think i 'd try this place again , especially since there are so many other options in the city .
asian	it started out as a small restaurant and the food was freshly prepared everyday . over the fast few months , this restaurant totally lost the quality and is very bad . very spicy , no flavor and lots of oily greasy foods . the chefs are not the same anymore and something changed with the management , and it 's lost its name . save you money , time and health by not going there .
asian	the only items that are good are the saimin , fried saimin , and the guava cake . everything else is pretty horrible including the spam musubi ! they don 't even cook the spam , it 's like they sliced it out of can and placed it in the musubi mold . if you want real hawaiian food head over to paradise hawaiian bbq at asu ! ! they even serve meat jun there .
asian	i expected a hot pot restaurant to be fill with asians hunkered over steaming troughs of soup . this restaurant is trying to make the hot pot experience as what i would describe as " urban chic . " i should have known seeing the clientele . no asians eating here on a saturday night . although i appreciate the variety of vegetable and protein choices available , i must agree with the other reviewers that the menu is expensive . if you are a hot pot purest this place isn 't for you .
asian	service : terrible . had to literally call the waitress to come to our table . food : very bland , no taste . pricing : we paid $ 50 for 2 dishes and 2 appetizers . i would only pay half . it was not worth it . * * i was very skeptical of ordering thai tea at a filipino restaurant , but i did , and of course it didn 't taste like thai tea . also knew that this restaurant was featured on dirty dining , so i had very low expectations anyways .
asian	after tonight i hate to say i won 't be back here . coming in to pick up my order , your " manager " emily was unprofessional complaining about a higher up that was calling to speak to her . she then charged me over 4 $ for extra spam in my saimin which is fine .. if i actually got extra spam . when i called to discuss it she had an awful attitude with me and asked me what i wanted her to do about it . poor customer service . you lost a loyal customer tonight
asian	this place misses the mark ... by a mile . the sesame chicken was essentially glazed pieces of fried something , the wonton soup was salt water , and the best thing was the egg roll which could have come from costco . i rarely give bad reviews , especially for places that i love so close to , but i can 't get around this one . overall , skip this place .
asian	my cousin took me here and i thought it was just ok . i didn 't like the broth and my meatballs had an off taste to it . the service was great . too bad the food wasn 't . final answer : wouldn 't be my first choice , but it serves convenience and i 'd go back for the sake of getting my pho fix .
asian	with the great reviews here i had high hopes but was left pretty disappointed . spring rolls 2 stars- were filled with premixed salad from a bag with mint and old rubbery shrimp . loved the peanut sauce . shrimp curry 2 stars- old tasting waaaaayyyy overcooked shrimp is a very mild ( i ordered it hot ) sauce with bamboo shoots and canned pineapple . i couldn 't get over the old tasting shrimp . the steamed white rice wasn 't good quality jasmine rice either . the service was excellent and i liked the cucumber water . but overall i 'm not a fan of this place .
asian	when i heard about futo buta , i pretty much dropped everything and went to get my ramen fix , but , after three attempts , it has turned out to be a far cry from authentic , flavorful ramen . ramen is all about a rich , delicious broth and this came no where near the authentic ramen i 've experienced many other places . two thumbs down .
asian	oops ... sorry it splashed down in your $ 20.00 watered down drink . waitress was clearly upset when i asked if onion soup had a meat base as she needed to go ask . * fwiw - it has pork , chicken and msg . food was way overpriced and far from gourmet and very small portions . lesson learned is to stick with makino 's dependability on great food at a very fair price and you cant go wrong .
asian	this was definitely the worst chinese food i have ever eaten . the drinks were so sweet we could not drink them , and the server even mentioned they were bad ! then the food tasted like vinegar and chili sauce with a couple pieces of chicken . we could not even tell the difference between sweet & sour sauce and orange chicken sauce . any dive buffet in any town would have far superior food . chin chin 's service was the worst we have had in vegas as well ! skip this place at all costs .
asian	i tried the place twice , once at the bar and the other time at the table . if you want a better sushi experience , then pull up a seat at the sushi bar . the table side service was just plain awful . the waiter was slow and forgot things that we ordered ( maybe on purpose i don 't know ) . after two tries , i don 't think i 'll be making a third trip . there 's just better ayce sushi out there .
asian	this place was just okay . the hawaiian poke was not too good . they mixed it with ocean salad which is kinda weird for poke , the fish was spongy and the poke sauce was weird tasting . they have a big selection of sushi , but the taste of it was just mediocre . i wouldnt take my visitors there . if i 'm going to eat sushi , i 'll go to island sushi instead . they have the absolute best sushi ! !
asian	since my daughter goes to pitt we wanted to treat our daughter to korean food . my family including my wife who is non- korean always order and if this is how they want to represent korean food to others they are doing disservice to our heritage. was the worst i have ever had . their had lettuce as one of mixing choices and their meat was hamburger meat ? will not go back .
asian	as much as i really wanted to like it i ended up disappointed . my family ordered some standards , shrimp fried rice , ginger beef , and kung pao chicken . to be fair the fried rice was quite good , however the ginger beef was battered and fried ( i 've never seen it served that way before ) . as for the chicken , there was very little actual chicken , and what there was of it was low quality meat . the service was good and friendly and the dining area is nicer that many chinese places . i might grab some fried rice for takeout sometime , but i will not be a regular customer .
asian	however , after trying the beef and the chicken i was disappointed that i didn 't just order the usual . it was greasy and heavy on the stomach . service was slow despite the bland , flat vibe of the place which was similar to a cafeteria sadly . the cold , cheap furniture really does the place no favours .
asian	visited on a quiet weekday night , seated right away and our drink order quickly taken . $ 5 seems a bit much for a thai tea , but it was yummy . i had wanted to order one of the noodle dishes , but was told that chef went home . umm ... ok . both of ordered pho and egg rolls . egg rolls were delicious ! pho ? eh . broth was really bland and needed a lot of help to make it just good . the pho at unphogettable is much better . sorry to say , we won 't be back .
asian	the atmosphere was alright , it was your typical chain restaurant bland atmosphere . i know i can 't give 0 stars but even if i could i would still give 1 star because our server , victor , was fun and knowledgeable . i love sushi and was excited to see that they had a menu that was relatable to sushi and non sushi lovers . i ordered the mexican roll and a side of sashimi . i was super excited because i love anything spicy . i ate the majority of my roll because it was good ! everything was going great until early the next morning when i felt extremely sick , as did my other friend ( who also got the sashimi ) .
asian	being there many times , food is going down hill , service ? ha there 's no such things , i have a friend used to work there , told me that has been change so many chefs , and there 's no hand pull noodles at all , that 's machine noodles , ask anybody there who can show you hand pull noodle how to make it ? or ask server have they ever seen people making hand pull noodles there ? i think now it 's time to quit coming here because there are not honor people who runs the place
asian	as soon as i walked in no one greeted me or wanted to take my order until i said " can i order . " i made a simple order took about 20 minutes for my sushi to prepare and on top of that there was some fish crumbs on a couple of my sushi rolls . i am strictly vegetarian and don 't eat fish so this to me is super disappointing . it 's sad to see them losing a customer .
asian	some tourists walk and look for the direction hard enough and tired enough with hungry toddlers to find that you not accepting any kids. maybe it would nicer if you understand what our feeling at that time by recommending other place nearby so that we don 't need to spend browsing a new place to eat !
asian	everything i tried tasted off and not fresh . i was only able to finish 1 / 3 of the combo banh mi before i gave up . the banh cuon was even worst . the meat inside the rice noodle wrap fell apart which is when i notice rice paper wrap could not be fresh . it was like they bought factory prepared wrap and assembled it there . the only semi decent item i tried was the bi cuon chay ( pork spring roll ) . unfortunately it 's not enough for me to return .
asian	me and my boyfriend stopped by and ordered a iced matcha tea and iced orange mocha . the iced matcha tea tasted like milk and a tiny hint of matcha . orange mocha tasted bitter / bold and the " orange " flavor wasn 't intriguing at all . i honestly thought starbucks tasted better .
asian	bellagio such a great place in lv but this noodles disgusting and it 's not about food , it 's about service
asian	the shrimp in two dishes did not taste fresh and were not deveined . i got 4 items : knock out rolls made with shrimp ( instead of tofu ) ( shrimp not good ) , pot stickers ( too salty in the interior with very little filling ) , chicken pad thai ( not bad but definitely below average compared to other thai places i 've been to , and the worst of the dishes the shrimp fried rice ( the bad tasting shrimp ruined the dish entirely , and no egg was in the rice as it states it should be in there on the menu ) . i threw out the rice but was able to eat the remaining items .
asian	fish tasted decent , but the menu is limited . desert isnt even included . service was fast and they have several hibachi stations , but theres several other sushi places nearby that are much better .
asian	i had the sweet and sour pork - something that is usually pretty much the same no matter where you go . the sauce was nice and the pork was quality meat . the fried rice was ok , but not great . i was disturbed , however , by the thai iced tea . it tasted how pupperoni dog treats smell - kind of fake and meaty . i don 't know about you , but that 's not something i want in a beverage .
asian	it 's not too expensive , but there are plenty of better options in the area . food was edible but i wouldn 't order it again .
asian	below average everything meat and produce low quality , my dduk tasted like freezer burn .. been here numerous times only bc of the convenience of location to buy some korean goods , but i really am not planning on going back any time soon .
asian	do not order the hotpot they charge you $ 32 for a plate of stuff thats worth 15 $ . i just moved near the area but definetely never coming back to this place again .
asian	very dirty restroom , hair founded in the rice and on the soup . very bad experience .
asian	won 't come back again . ! waiting for hour for an spring rolls and it came out cold . it 's looked like it 's been it the fridge . i had to remind them all the time that we still missing orders .
asian	the only thing memorable about thing place was how much of a rush our server was in to get us to order our lunch . pei wei box dinners from walmart are tastier . the wife got four pieces of shrimp in the szechuan shrimp . my orange chicken seemed to have been frozen-fried and doused in a molasses and marmalade mix - yuck . the fried rice had 2 peas a one carrot chunk in it . not even if i was starving would i come back ! ! !
asian	very nice waitress and prompt as well. it was 12 : 30pm and the place was empty as well , not a good sign for weekday lunch . the mongolian beef was barely passable , the fried rice flat and bland . egg roll was over cooked along with the inedible fried wontons . i liked the speedy friendly service , but there 's nothing here i would come back for .
asian	had to ask 3x for napkins before any came , servers seem to purposefully avoid you / not make eye contact . you come out smelling really , really bad . food was nothing special , and the spicy broth was really sour for some reason . service - 1 food - 3 overall - 2 * *
asian	the pho had decent flavor but the texture of the scallops and squid was below average , however the shrimp texture was great . the peanut noodle my girlfriend got was okay . i would never pay for the quality they offer and the poor service they provide . the waiters didn 't ask how the meal was and did not ask if we wanted to take home the leftovers ( i was barely able to muster the courage to eat half ) . the only truly good thing about this restaurant is the decor . i am leaving a restaurant unsatisfied for only the second time at any restaurant in my life ..
asian	below average in most ways service quick food not fresh or quality - below average throughout wonton soup bad large room dimsum lunch may be slightly better than normal dinner items but i doubt its much better
asian	i ordered my food spicy and instead of mongolian beef they delivered what can best be described as " wet beef . " no spice at all , not only lack of heat but a lack of any flavor at all . extremely bland . if you are very hungry and happen to be standing right outside red dragon you might stop in . otherwise there are so many better places nearby .
asian	basic decor . would not come again . food was bland and left me wanting more .
asian	disappointing. service was attentive . too bad , be nice to have good thai in the area , will look elsewhere .
asian	their owners are cheap . wooden disposal chopsticks were given to dine in customers and their pho didn 't come with any of the typical garnishes such as green onions - which don 't cost very much . their pho is also $ 1 more than most comparable restaurants .
asian	mostly tasteless . i went here based on the ok reviews but that was a mistake .
asian	tried their lunch buffet last week . taste and quality of food was below average . food was very dry and not fresh . no variety . it 's a small restaurant . restrooms were stinky . won 't recommend this restaurant at all .
asian	servers have no experience and lack of communications . vegetables pancakes were pre-cooked ( kept in warmer ) . flavor of soup stock was just bland . beef was hard and small portion . small table space . serving wares are melamine . very disappointed .
asian	pho had way too much noodles . used to be better and recently gotten worst .
asian	the rolls are fried tasting , the service is slow ( although polite ) . i just can 't justify anyone coming here except for the fact that it is in a great location for people on living in the highrises here that are too lazy to walk 3 blocks further to get decent sushi .
asian	started with vegetarian cold rolls that were mostly stuffed with rice noodles , hardly any veggies . shared a few mains : veggie pad thai ( smelled like ketchup , tasted pretty gross ) , cashew chicken ( good but very sauce heavy ) , egg fried rice ( bland and dry ) , and spicy eggplant ( the best dish we tried ) . service was good and quick , but doesn 't make up for the food .
asian	the rice has too much water . the bok choi with garlic was good . the bill was 26.00 for me with no drink . it was a lot of money for average food . only came here because the other restaurants didn 't open this early .
asian	use to be good , but now they just toss stuff together . too much spice ( turmeric ) in one dish . the other dish -papaya salad tasted a few days old . i won 't be returning . try natalie thai .
asian	i don 't know why people like it so much , unless you like getting yelled at by the owner . he 's definitely a character .
asian	went in for lunch . i ordered the sashimi salad . it was a few pieces of sashimi slapped on a bed of romaine lettuce ( the kind that you get in a bag at the grocery store ) and drizzled in some spicy sauce . totally uninspired . then i ordered the salmon eggs and mackerel sushi . the salmon eggs were ok but the mackerel was awful . how can a place like this stay in business ? i 'm never coming back .
asian	this place has a presotea inside the store which is so garbage . my bubble tea was watered down and tasted like flour and sugar .. watered down flour and sugar . other presotea locations are much better . just give me $ 5 and i 'll serve you some delicious flour water .
asian	pretty awful actually went once will never return . had the roti and doubles . skimps on chicken big time . tasteless . don 't waste your money on this place .
asian	way better dim sum in hawaii where i am from . everything just tasted a little off .
asian	the decor inside is really nice - muted greens , maroons , and blacks . fountains , faux bamboo bridges , fountains ( i know , i wrote fountains twice ... there were a lot of them . ) etc ... it sets the scene well and is fun to wander around in , but it doesn 't make up for the bad service , the bad chefs , and the flavorless , unenthusiastically served , overpriced food . 2 stars , and they are lucky to get that .
asian	hard to fry broccoli and sprouts at the same time . chicken was overcooked scallops were good service was good
asian	be prepared to wait and wait and wait and wait at the front , the hostess seems to appear once a blue moon to see what your reservations are ... waiting 20 minutes to tell her our reservations and to wait an additional x amount of minutes is punishment to your stomach ... oh by the way we are still waiting
asian	also when it gets here it will look inedible and taste really bad . you will pay a lot too and don 't say anything or risk an eye roll from the wait staff . seriously skip this place
asian	and wait .... and wait . so we were taken to our seat behind some random bush and never got to place our order . we waited for about 20 minutes and no one came so we just took off . will never come back to be honest i don 't know why we went there in the first place the last time we went the rice was undercooked two times
asian	just awful . don 't bother.you 'll be genuinely grossed out . the flavors suggest the cook u uses the same pan for every dish , doesn 't clean up after each order.so , you taste seafood in a chicken order , and something almost chemical .
asian	i liked the curry clam chowder and that was it .
asian	my boyfriend and i are fans of sushi burritos and recently moved in the area so we thought we 'd give this place a shot . i ordered a # 5 which comes with shrimp tempura , the tail was still attached , it was pre-made and not crunchy at all . once we left after throwing 3 / 4 of our burritos away , afraid of eating old fish and getting sick . we got home and sure enough i became sick and threw my burrito up and my boyfriend has been in the bathroom with stomach cramps . do not eat here .
asian	the rice had old bits of previous rice they didn 't clean from the pan , and the orange chicken tasted like the wok and old oil . skip this place and try someplace else ! my daughters were not happy , and that means mama ain 't happy either ! won 't come back .
asian	besides the egg rolls , i wouldn 't consider going back for some food ... i can 't believe that people would order from this establishment
asian	i was craving filipino food and decided to come here due to all the great reviews . i came , but was very disappointed with the food . i am a filipino native and moved to az from san diego , ca so i am used to quality tasting food . it 's unfortunate .. the food here is a bit bland and a little too oily ; my kids didn 't even like the food .. i hope one day some good restaurants pop up , until then i guess i 'll just be going back and forth to ca to fulfill my cravings ..
asian	their menu overhead and in front of you at the counter had competing prices , so you don 't really have a clear idea of how much things are . the drinks were not that great but quite overpriced . i got the oreo devil slush , tasted like a cheap chocolate slush with mix . the royal no.9 tea was acceptable , taste like a plain black tea , nothing special . it was quite a disappointment since there aren 't a lot of boutique bubble tea places that aren 't a franchise of some asian beverage giant . it 's a shame that beside the beautiful branding , there 's only products not worth coming back for .
asian	i stopped by for the first time saturday , 29 jan 2011 , right at 1130 hours and there were four customers waiting on food . none of the steam tables had anything in them . it is now called , " east buffet . " this place is right across the street from maceys at the mall . lunch buffet is u $ 11.00 , if you can get it .
asian	but that isn 't saying much ....... need to expand the menu , order from i pad , and the front door always let 's in a freezing cold breeze in the winter and doesn 't stay closed . get it fixed .
asian	service has become horrible . i ordered for delievery waited over an hour ... no apology turns out they forgot it was for delievery . also my daughter found hairs in her chicken today ... done with this place
asian	hop on the metro and head to chinatown , this place is expensive and really nothing special .
asian	chicago had some of the best local chinese i 've eaten to date .
asian	i can tell you they do have their loyal followers when the restaurant is nearly full on a chilly cold weeknight after 9 : 30 pm . i ordered a dumpling noodle soup . the portion is big ... with tons of vegetables and 5 big fat shrimp dumplings . however , it was loaded with msg ! after i finished eating that my tongue was numbed for the whole night . i would not recommended best choice if you are really sensitive to msg . the services were quick and friendly . cash only !
asian	ramen not made with ramen noodles . you get soba or udon . the soba noodles were too soft and didn 't have much texture . i like my ramen with fresh chewy noodles . 2 . wagyu is served with gold ... why ? wagyu is gold in meat form ! also not great , don 't believe it was fresh or perhaps it wasn 't japanese wagyu or a lower grade , i dunno . 3 . chicken heart and gizzards tasted like it was boiled only and not grilled . texture was tough and the meat itself did not taste flavorful . would recommend for drinks but maybe not food .
asian	the rest of their dishes are generic . i highly recommend , due to the price of short ribs , you go in and order boat loads of kalbi and maybe some veggies for digestion . the rest is just msg saturated foods . forget about the staff , they treat you like a leper .
asian	they call them " sexy rolls " restaurant had interesting decor . ran out of ingredients when i tried to order more fresh rolls . they used ketchup for pad thai sauce . just go for the sexy rolls and get them to go !
asian	when i bit into the first piece , it tasted like frozen chicken . for the price they charge they should be able to use fresh chicken . what a waste of money , a waste of time , and a total embarassment to the restaurant 's name . the other food we ate , average not much to talk about or blaze around the news . probably the most expensive and tiny portion food ever . they are supposed to be known for the hainan chicken . now i know it is overrated . not alot of bang for that buck ! never gonna be back .
asian	cheap cheap cheap ! basic chinese - noodles , rice , chicken , pork , shrimp . don 't expect fine dining or top quality , it is what it is , you can 't beat the price and needless to say , you won 't leave hungry . great for large groups !
asian	.. i think : d try the baked meat sauce macaroni during afternoon tea hours , reaaally good . their fried rice is very soft and fresh . i love their chili oil , its really spicy . update : walked out after 40 minutes today after being blatantly ignored by 2 waitresses and manager . free soup and tea though . they all acknowledge you when u put your hand up . you put hand down then they go on about their business . or they say wait a second and not come back . : ( heartbroken this happened to my fav hk resto
asian	the website says 60-90 minutes but constantly is over 2 hours . i am less than 5kms away . this happens repeatedly and does not matter if there is traffic or not . on top of that the driver has an attitude and once asked me to come down to pick up the food . unacceptable . as much as i like their food i will not order from there again .
asian	lots of msg left me very thirsty and they were very light on the meat . this neighborhood is spoiled by bach yen ( just on gerrard ) but it was closed . we won 't return .
asian	the selection of foods is exceptional . quality is also quite good . update : went back recently and quality has gone down hill . too bad this place was quite good .
asian	prices are sky high but unfortunately the food quality is sub par . we did the all you can eat and the food was arriving at an astonishing rate ... i then realized some of it was pre made and tasted horrible . the quality of the fish was lacking to say the least . tea was not included ! how cheap are you cynthia ? then came the desert ice cream ... can you say freezer burn ? yuck . will never go back . thanks for stealing my $ 80 .
asian	i wanted to say something however my buddy who lives 2 houses down from this place is a regular here . he was making excuses so i let it go because they take good care of him . i 'm fortunate to know a bit about sushi because i 'm good friend 's with a japanese chef who has taught me alot . maki rolls stuffed with crunchy tempura is not sushi . the other thing that bothered me about this place is how they don 't accept anything other than cash . not impressed !
asian	and it was just regular , not the fresh kind either . thoroughly disappointed w the lackluster bland nigris , heavy handed sauce saturated rolls and the awkward fake friendly service ! think other reviews pointed out their flaws already so i don 't even wanna elaborate . wish they were decent but looks like i 'll continue to look for a good sushi lunch place .
asian	after being ignored for five minutes the guy behind the counter yelled at me for not knowing my number . food is mediocre . there are better and more convenient italian places in the area .
asian	we came here for lunch on saturday , not so many people but still wait for a long time until our teppanyaki section began . sirloin - average or even lower . do not recommend . chicken - nothing special just average teriyaki chicken . personally too salty for me . fired rice - with egg and mixed vegetables , too oily .
asian	everything is fresh when you dine early right when they just opened but not so fresh towards lunch time . they don 't have a way to keep things warm , what we got was room temperature calamari , room temperature pork which is not crispy at all and okay chicharon bulaklak . 2 stars but there 's room for improvement .
asian	i went for lunch while doing some business in the area and just wanted a nice place to sit and go over some paper work . i walked in and sat at the only clean table . instead of be asked what i 'd like to drink , i was asked to move to a dirty table so a party of three could sit at my table . the party of three received their food and drinks ahead of me . the service was poor , place was actually dirty , and the food was comparable to asian fast food places .
asian	i ordered the tofu with vegetables and mushrooms with white rice . it came with the free soy milk . there 's tons of tofu but not enough vegetables . i find the food a little bit on the salty side . the soy milk was great , though . the service was great . it came in less than 10 minutes considering there are so many people lining up for their food .
asian	better off walking 3 minutes to the mcdonald 's down the street , my friend got food poisoning
asian	too sweet , no veggies other than bean sprouts . won 't be back .
asian	portions are small and soup gets watered down if it is too busy . the rice ( com tam ) is hard and dry . been here a couple times before learning . service is so-so . i don 't expect much for service at pho though . opt for another pho nearby if possible !
asian	though most was tasty , i don 't think it 's worth what you pay when much of the food has gone cold / hard . maybe this was a one off ... warm sushi and cold chicken shouldn 't be a norm at a buffet .
asian	wonton noodles and dumplings are pretty good , but just about everything else is really sweet and corn starchy and under spiced and etc etc
asian	check it and check your change ! three times consecutively i have come here grabbing pick up delivery after work and the same guy always seems to " accidentally " add something to my order and " accidentally " short me $ 1 from my change ... really ? ? mind you i 'm coming to the restaurant at 3-4am ... i have a feeling he can get away w / this since most people eating at this time are drunk or w / large group of people . a dollar here , a dollar there .. that adds up . i feel like he 's trying to tip himself ..
asian	$ 22 dollars for a small , and i mean small bowl of noodle soup . next time i 'd rather risk my life and troll the neighborhood or get back in my rental car then eat here , not to mention it literally took 40 minutes for my soup . the waitress took my order after flagging her down and she never returned , seems like the cook brought the soup out to me . beware ! you were warned ! ! ! !
asian	3 dead fish in the aquarium behind our table . very unhygienic . do not go here !
asian	after eating here 12 / 16 / 16 on 12 / 17 / 16 i developed severe ( 8 out of 10 on the pain scale ) stomach cramping , diarrhea , and vomiting . i had the wonton soup and the fried dumplings . i missed work . no other person in my party had the dumplings or wonton soup . one person from my party had diarrhea , but none of the pain that i am having . i will be contacting a lawyer as i missed work .
asian	normally i give fairly kind reviews but this place is awful ! ! ! ! ! ! if you are diet conscious , eat here ! you 'll have zero appetite after the first bite . yucky food ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! waitress extremely nice and decent atmosphere but the food truly is inedible ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
asian	dead fish in tank while eating here and got severe food poisoning that day ! do not eat here
asian	i told the woman behind the counter that i wanted rice noodle pad thai , but without meat as i am a vegan . she said no problem at all . we went home and my sister passed me the container that said veggie . i had a few bites of it and the next forkful i pulled out a piece of chicken . i immediately went to the bathroom and threw up . so very gross . don 't trust this restaurant to give you the food that you ask for . who the hell knows , maybe it was cat in my container . i wouldn 't put it past this place . i wish i could give this restaurant a zero
asian	beware ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! food is disgusting ..... nasty red cheap egg rolls. lo mein is loaded with msg ..... i am really feeling sick after eating there over priced nasty food ......
asian	please share the word . i saw them once picking cash from table and giving it to the owner / manager . i have personally inquired from all the staff every now and then . i was super disappointed . there used to be a girl named kareshma and then now there 's a guy , both told the same thing . it 's a nice place but keeping the tips is just wrong .
asian	ordered from here last night . waited an hour for the sushi . my girlfriend and i ate it and it was good at the time . woke up this morning feeling awful ! sick to our stomachs . stay away . their service is crap as well . the guy making the sushi was really rude to me when i questioned having to wait an hour when he only had a table of 5 in house . don 't do it !
asian	food wasn 't bad , service left a little bit to be desired . the hair that was wrapped up with my silverware was a little unwanted . but worst of all , i paid with a credit card and less than 3 hours later there were $ 500 worth of unauthorized charges made on my credit card for purchases from walmart.com. highly disappointed ! ! ! !
asian	foosia does not accept their own money mailer coupon . went in last night and the young lady was so rude and had no customer service . no manager on-site as well ! would have loved to try this new place .
asian	the restaurant adds a 20 % gratuity and is not upfront about pointing it out on your ticket . the food and service is good ; the location is in a prime area . there was no need to resort to underhand tactics in securing a 40 % tip . ruined the entire experience .
asian	had high hopes for this place . ordered a couple rolls . my wife took her first bite of her roll , looked down and saw a cockroach crawl from underneath her plate . they offered to make us a new roll . we agreed , they brought out the same partially eaten roll , no lie . and gave us two tiny little pieces of sushi to compensate . the owner was apologetic but did not offer a comped meal and ultimately charged us full price for roach infested dinning experience . 808 sushi tapas was the place before this one and kills there sushi . we will not be back to this place ...
asian	horrible service . we went to all you can eat lunch and if you leave meat on the plate the waiter will charge you extra at the end of lunch . the meat looked like dog food with no flavor . i left the place wanting to throw up . never again ! ! ! ! ! !
asian	ichiza was shut down by the south nevada health department on june 30 , 2014 , for the fourth time in four years . that is unacceptable . they were tagged with 38 demerits from 10 different violations ranging from handwashing issues to proper temperature for stored foods . beware , especially since they are serving uncooked food . as far as the food and service goes , the okra-natto was interesting , albeit slimy ( but it 's supposed to be ) , the sushi was good and the service was good . but if i had read about their sanitary issues , i wouldn 't have gone . you can google it , if you want to read for yourself .
asian	if you enjoy food poisoning , then yes , of course i would recommend the shit tea cafe . if you enjoy rude service , then yes , of course i would recommend the shit tea cafe . if you enjoy having the runs for 24 hours , then by all mean , go to the shit tea cafe ! the culprit ? coconut bubble tea . i lay here bed ridden after indulging in bubble tea i had yesterday . i mean really .... don 't go here
asian	beware if you get there near closing time .. they lower the temp on the soup so what happens when the raw meat it cools down too fast to cook the meat .. the owner tells me he does not know why the meat does not cook sometimes .. no refund or discount .. could not eat finish meal
asian	holy bland food alert batman ! ! ! before i get started , i can say the only reason we went here is because the viewing window of the shumai chef made us interested and the fact that bazaar meats would accept a walk in . anyway , server was sweet , but lacked basic menu and drink knowledge . the chefs cannot be tasting the food before they send it . the wonton soup literally tasted like water . it was horrible . had the shumai ( lucky-12 ) and they were simply flavorless . the bao bun tastes like a pork burger . had two other noodle dishes and total was $ 106 ...
asian	if you order a lot they will start charging you double for your drinks . sushi was so-so , nothing special . it 's $ 15 ayce so what do you expect . i was still nice and gave a $ 5 tip but never again . go up the street to sushi bomb and pay the extra $ 5 for way better service and sushi .
asian	i can 't get them to return my phone calls . what a pain ! it looks like they processed an additional $ 97 dollars on my card the day after my visit ( in addition to the $ 160 bill i paid on the actual day of my meal ) . maybe it was just a mistake , maybe it was intentional fraud - either way , i 'm never going back ! !
asian	i stopped by on 12 / 10 / 2016 @ 1 : 18 pm ( server was patrick ) to buy 1 michelob ultra which was $ 7.00 and i tipped $ 1.00 on receipt . i always keep all receipts for anything and always write down on my receipt what i tip and the total . when i was doing expenses at end of month i saw that i was charged $ 15.00 for this transaction . not sure how this could have been a mistake with these numbers but in any event it happened . i hope this doesn 't happen to anyone else and whoever had to do with this has been caught and dealt with appropriately . this is an unacceptable business practice .
asian	i sent my soup back because it was cold . and when the server was bringing it back to me , my girlfriend saw the server spit into my soup ! ! ! when i went to the manager , the manager said i was lying ! wow they they supported their server and not someone who 's buying dinner in this new restaurant ! ! i will never go here again ! ! neither should anyone else ! ! gross ! ! ! ! !
asian	i stop at this place and the food was cold and slow service . pho soups were really oily and cold . the noodles were hard i asked for a new plate and they made a big deal . never coming back again
asian	i went here past october and had a serious finger infection from eating the crab legs . large amount of pus removed and the results from the lab was food contamination . apparently , insect feces were in the food and went inside the nail of my thumb , thus the finger infection . even thought the outside is clean , you don 't know what the kitchen looks like . i don 't anyone to go through what i 've been . someone needs to call the health inspection .
asian	just filled up the tank , car started shaking like crazy . got to a toyota service center , who told us we had a bad tank of gas .
asian	norovirus ! my wife and i ate here and vomited all night long . we had diarrhea for a week . do not ever eat here ! ! ! pukeville usa
asian	bulgogi looked like a stew . jap che noodles drenched in oil . horrible ! ! ! !
asian	this place deserves zero stars . came on a sunday . ordered of the lunch menu that was given to us . after placing the order , the waitress told us there is no lunch special on sunday , and the prices were triple . they wouldn 't honor the lunch prices or apologize for the mistake . we left without eating . asked to speak to a manager and there no manager on duty , which was a lie because i saw him there . the waitress was a total b * * * h ! ! !
asian	i 'd really only eat here again if nothing else nearby was open . the menu is inexpensive , food comes in large portions but the quality if just not there . they cook with an obscene amount of msg and grease . they have poor breakfast choices as well and this place just cannot fry an egg properly . this place is not the cleanest , even by quick and dirty chinese restaurant standards.the milk tea is very weak but leaves an awful film in your mouth . cold drinks here are super watery .
asian	charged an extra dollar for taking left-over red bean drink home . charged extra for ordering duck feet , instead of both duck feet & wings .
asian	the waitress with glasses kept on arguing about our age and could not serve us ( we were born in 1994 ) because she thinks we are under the age limit and a young male waiter was very disrespectful to us where at one point in time told one of us to " chill out ! " and walked away . terrible customer service ! !
asian	this was the second time i ordered takeout , a bowl of wonton soup . both times , it was mostly broth . for $ 7.25 , i received a quart of broth , 3 spinach leaves , 2 small shrimp , and 3 wontons . i will say the wontons are very good , although quite a bit smaller than you usually get at your neighborhood chinese restaurant . my husbands meal was fine although smaller than the size you receive when you dine in .
asian	this restaurant is a big joke ; i am questioning the " sanity " of the cook and management ; i have a feeling that they serve leftovers to their customers . if there is fake news , well .... this restaurant serves fake food ( not representative of what is on the menu ) . total waste of money : ordered vermicelli / pork / spring roll ; roti with chicken curry , and hai nan chicken with rice . worse than mediocre !
asian	my wife and her family and i tried their unlimited sushi evening . while the food is ok our service was really slow and arrogant . what really infuriates one the most is they fine you ( charge extra ) if you do not finish the little left over rice on your plate ! ! only dine here if you like to pay fines ! ! we will not be returning to this place !
asian	she could not care less about your experience . after having told me that it was $ 26 like 3 times , she asked me if i would be out in about an hour because at that time their restaurant gets busy ! made me feel like a bum ! sushi selection was poor . not sure if food tasted bad because of the interaction at the entrance or that it was just substandard .
asian	their csrs probably will just ask you to sign an agreement without disclosing to you the most important part . * * * all furniture need to be in exactly the right place for the assembly team . * * * if it is even in so much as a different room next to the correct location they will refuse to assemble and you lose the $ amount you paid for assembly .
asian	this place is a scam . i ordered the beef bulgogi combo with the side of an extra tofu soup . the lady at the register said that it would cost an extra $ 5 . when i came to pick up my order , i received one tofu soup and was told that the other one was on its way out . when i returned to pick up the second soup , the lady at the register shook her head and said that i paid $ 5 for a larger size for the tofu soup . when clearly , it 's the same size the food is decent , i guess .
asian	the worst part is that they included our two kids which are the age of 4 and 1 . i 've never been to an establishment where they add kids to it .
asian	i drove 20 mins to this place on monday around 5pm and place had a closed sign . walked inside and was told that they were closed . what a waste of time ! !
asian	i ordered a lunch special and it was $ 7.99 . the sandwich fries and drink were included . sweet and hot peppers were complimentary . my bill was 8.95 . how did it get that high ? i ordered sweet and hot . they upcharged me ! they try to nickel and dime you for other things here all the time . buyer beware . seems like the mob priced the menu .
asian	and the prices on the menu are fair , but the owner ( some vietnamese dude ) overcharges you like crazy . we were charged $ 130 for a bill of $ 88 ( $ 108 including tax and tip ) , and it took a great deal of effort to get only some of the extra charge back . the owner is seeeriously shady and very rude , so make sure you have your detective glasses on if you choose to eat here .
asian	oily nasty mystery chicken ! this place does not care about the quality of food they put out . everything was wet with oil - down to the crunch noodles . gross gross gross ! ! ! ! ! ! !
asian	horrible excuse for edible food . management / ownership does not care . my time spent providing them with thoughtful feedback was met with being yelled at by manager / owner and hung up upon . for shame .
asian	when we placed our order over the phone we said that we would pay by credit card at the door when the driver arrived . he forgot to bring the machine , so he started freaking out on my husband and yelling " cash only ! " my husband offered to drive to the closest atm and get cash for him but then the driver said he didn 't have time to wait that he had more work to do . he started swearing and yelling and took the food and drove off . this was by far the scariest experience and i would not recommend this place to anyone . i don 't want people like that knowing where i live or coming near my home .
asian	our credit card was hacked two times after eating here . use cash only or choose another buffet . very rude , snooty staff ! so tired of servers who are clearly asian , speak broken english if any english , but have name tags like " samantha " " joan " etc ... these buffets need investigated !
asian	very slow refill on both item ( 30-60 mins ) , and even worst is they only refill enough to serve 10 -15 customer , if you like seafood go somewhere else . very disappointed .
asian	pay attention to your bill . we eat here regularly and had something slightly different tonight . looked at my bill cause it seemed higher than normal .... and they had added 18 % gratuity to our bill . we are a family of 5 , two adults and 3 children . i was told any bill that contains 5 entrees automatically is added 18 % . i have been tipping for the last 1.5 years which means i have given this restaurant 40 % in tips . so upset that no , one has ever said that gratuity was added . i 've never had gratuity added to our normal size family .
asian	- credit card fraud ( billed twice , which they denied ) , but food and service were great i went on valentines day with my wife . the food and service were great . however , they billed my credit card twice and then refused to correct the second charge - after hours on hold with me credit card company they resolved the issue , but unfortunately ono and restaurant were obstructionist and dismissive . especially surprising because we visit often - no more .
asian	think before you order , especially if expect to receive a refund in a timely manner . they lie repetitively and it is now three moths that i am waiting for a refund on a shipment that was never even filled but billed to me on the day of the order placement .
asian	no chicken or fish , the whole container was dripping with fat ( i got it all over my clothes and phone ) , when i opened the taro leaf it was full of big chunks of fat , and the lomi salmon had exactly 3 little diced pieces of salmon . i took it back for a refund , and he would only refund half the cost . what a ripoff !
asian	the city fined this restaurant multiple times because it is infested with cockroaches ! ! ! look it up . the owners were aware of it and did nothing. they should be ashamed ! !
asian	i have been going here for years and generally speaking i have enjoyed their awesome " salmon lover " sashimi platter but my last few visits had me gagging . the sashimi was not fresh ... it had that dreaded " fishy taste " non sushi eaters fear . i have never has such terrible sashimi in my life and for $ 16 i expected something better . i have never had issues with any other food here but my love for sashimi has forced me to scale down some stars and maybe look for another sushi place to love .
asian	honestly , the premade sushi you can buy from your local supermarket is better than this and definitely fresh .
asian	the to go orders are 1 / 2 the size . if you eat in the restaurant you get full portions don 't order to go unless you aren 't hungry . i called to inform , and instead of them fixing the issue , they told me to review poorly and tell yelp " we like when a customa eat a here " :
asian	the village has fine food and they 're very friendly , but their hours and posted delivery times that they advertise to their website are not consistent with how the business is run . you may call at 10pm on saturday and they 're closed , or midnight on friday and they quit delivering , etc . it 's frustrating and bad business .
asian	the waitresses are thief ! ! ! ! they took my iphone 6plus ... but they don 't want to admit it . even though my icloud / gps telling me that my iphone is still there ... all they say is we are busy .. funny coz i have my find my iphone lock . they can 't use it anyway . no one admitting that who kept my iphone . i will report this to the authorities . i will never coming back this place ... be aware guys ! .. update ; it 's been 6hrs now , and my gps still saying pho little saigon address ... shame ... shame .. shame .. shame
asian	this is below average food , nice experience , above average price for poor quality food . there are much better hibachi restaraunts out there .
asian	they charge you $ 1 dollar per person for water and they sometime they fail to tell you that . went with a family of 5 and got charged extra $ 5 dollars on the bill and we didn 't even drink the water .
asian	especially if you order lots of dishes , they charge you more on each item , and dishes that you didn 't ordered . make sure you double check your bill before you pay ... they food is just so so ..
asian	they do not convert us money ! ! ! ! ! ! you will pay canadian price in us dollars ! ! ! ! and when asked he said that he didn 't convert because of bank fees ! ! ! !
asian	they say free local delivery , only 2 miles away , tried to add $ 3.00 onto my bill ! thankfully i caught it and cancelled the order . they said 2 miles is was very , very far away .
asian	they stole $ 75 from me . never was delivered food , promised refund would go through . never received refund , these people are low life thieves .....
asian	i should have read yelp reviews before i came here .. service : the service we received was not good . our waiters were rushy and rude . my sister ordered a soda and those chinese donuts ( cold ) for her soup but it didn 't come until halfway through our meal . food : yes they have a large selection to pick from but majority of what we ordered wasn 't even good . i would never ever come here again .
asian	all young waiters seem rude and don 't care the customers . food has less meat , comparing to the other places .
asian	too bad for them as there are many other sushi restaurants in the valley and this one has just lost my future business in addition to my suggested restaurants for visiting business associates and friends .
asian	this place has good food most of the time but the service there has always been terrible . they definitely don 't deserve to be tipped . now they started charging gratuity for everything including even if only one person . if they want a tip then provide service don 't charge someone for providing bad service . will not be returning . to many others places that serves good food as well as provide outstanding service .
asian	this place is awful ! my boyfriend and i had sushi delivered from here and the calamari was burnt rubber . the sushi was sub-par , and the rolls were probably some of the worst i 've tried in my entire life of eating sushi . this is where it gets messed up- we finished unsatisfied ... and then my throat began to get numb . it led to my gums swelling , and my left cheek having an overwhelming numbness too . i am not allergic to anything ! ! ! also , i order the exact same rolls from every place i go to . i have never had anything like this happen to me . i am now contemplating sushi delivery from anywhere
asian	this place is the worst chinese take out restaurant i 've been to , ever . very filthy and dingy looking - shouldn 't have ordered when i walked in but i was hungry and in a hurry . the food i ordered , orange beef and an egg roll were absolutely awful - the beef was simply a clump of deep fried breading covered in red liquid , the egg roll was an oily pocket of unidentifiable filling . stay away - places like these should not offer items for human consumption .
asian	the sashimi was warm and appeared to have been previously dipped in soy sauce by someone else and placed back on the plate . my boyfriend became ill 2-3 hours after . he had a fever , cold chills , nausea , and stomach pain and vomiting all night . at one point he was dry heaving blood ! he says it was the most awful illness he has ever experienced . this incident has been reported to the health district also . do not risk it ! the service was also terrible .
asian	this restaurant does not open at 11 as it says everywhere online.got there and they said they may open at 5 or maybe in a half hour . my family paid 15 bucks to park we got there and they were closed on a saturday afternoon . very unprofessional .
asian	i ate there against my best judgement because my daughter really wanted a california roll before seeing a movie . big mistake . 5 hours later it is a puke feast at my house . stay away from this place at all cost . there are so many more reputable restaurants in tempe marketplace to eat at . please pass this place by . i have filed a complaint with the maricopa county environmental services department . expect a visit from the food inspector . dirty trash cans , dirty soy sauce bottles , just walk on past this place for your own health 's sake .
asian	my bank indicated my credit card was cloned with a different name . this was the only place this could have happened . had not used this credit card in over 4 months . my bank clearly indicated that my card was swiped using an identity theft machine .
asian	at lunch buffet today , i found chicken in the dish labeled vegetarian . it was a veg puff and it had chicken inside . no one felt bad or apologetic . just took my plate away when i mentioned and replaced it with two veg puffs which i didn 't want to eat .
asian	i visited flo 's for the first time today and had a bad first impression . they have some dishes listed as vegetarian ( i 'm vegan ) , and according to the waiter ..... they are not . he told me the brown sauce is made with a chicken stock ..... ummmmm not even close to being vegetarian , let alone vegan . he said they could make it vegan so i trusted ( scary ! ) that they would . so buyer beware ...... ask many questions and don 't trust the menu labeling !
asian	ordered food for my birthday today and got a piece of bone in my food . sadly , realized it when it was in my mouth between my teeth . the feeling is still there and honestly it hurts to see that my beliefs were exploited . being a pure vegetarian it ruined everything / my day for me and i left the food in between . my confidence is shattered and i am never ordering again . vegetarians and vegans make sure you scan the food before you eat , one spoon at a time .... don 't trust this place to take care of your needs .
asian	we called to ask if it was possible to get a reservation and were told that it was . we asked for 7pm and they confirmed . on arrival at 7pm , we were told that we would have to wait an extra 40 minutes , and that they don 't give reservations . we left immediately . i 'm not eating somewhere that would make misleading statements to get us to come in .
asian	it seems for panda only low mein has noodles . with no picture you may not get what you are expecting . poor customer service as i called and was told sorry you ordered the wrong thing . if you google chow mein all the pictures have noodles , so this must be their version of " chow mein . " food is overpriced and poor quality . the boneless ribs were full of grisel . i ended up ordering pizza hut for the family instead .
asian	the staff deliberately forget to apply the discount , and when asked why not , they treat you with little respect . check your receipt carefully !
asian	be prepared to be turned away if showing up past 9 : 30 on a weekday . drove 20 mins here and arrived at 9 : 45 only to be told they were closed even though it says open until 11 .
asian	do not waste your money and do not put the unworthy calories in your body from this restaurant . quality of food = sucks price = ok food selection = sucks customer service = sucks dnt waste your money here . not worth it .
asian	we took a bit and threw it away . we had the shacha chicken and pad thai . shacha was good , pad thai not so good .
asian	( i tip 15-20 % ) black pepper chicken ! it 's the only place in town that has the perfect kind : real meat , real pepper , real tasty . i also love their egg rolls . the wrapper is crispy and not airy like most around town . their rangoons aren 't awful and the service is pretty speedy . this is my second fav place in madison for chinese . do it , do it now ! try the yangzhou fried rice . yum
asian	this is not the pho pasteur anymore you once knew . seems like it 's a different owner now . long story short , i got a piece of steel scrub scrap in my bowl . * * update * * it turns out i got food poisoned from that bowl of pho . i had a series of terrible stomach aches and eventually needed a thorough medical attention . what a mess .
asian	the food is not spicy at all and i ordered an 8 . in addition , the food is overly priced . with so many places to eat nearby , spend your money elsewhere .
asian	the food itself isn 't bad , but they really skimp on portion size . it 's really expensive for what you get ! ! ! i 've tried the dan dan noodles and another dish . again , it 's not bad , just really small and really expensive .
asian	be wary of this place - used a certain credit card here once during my whole vegas trip , and 3 months later find it has been skimmed and a bunch of fraudulent charges show up .
asian	i ordered take-out on a sunday evening and the tuna and crab did not smell or taste good . i 've never had crab meat that wanted me to throw up and lose my appetite like that . i had to throw out the entire " house roll . " the salmon rolls seemed okay so i ate those . i won 't be ordering from here again .
asian	i don 't understand why this place currently has five stars on yelp . the establishment is clean , but mostly consists of rolls , undercooked rice , and run of the mill fish . soy sauce is from the bottle . there are plenty of other wonderful sushi places nearby . go there instead !
asian	i work in the restraunt industry for awhile to know some common sense before even making the order if i don 't have what the customer wants i will first offer something else or say would you like something similar but no she just assumed i was going to be fine i asked her to make a teriyaki bowl instead and when i receive my bowl it was very cold and disgusting and my stomach hurts i 'm never going back ! ! ! ! ! horrible service !
asian	the service was awful . i ordered edamame . when it didn 't come , i asked for it and was brought two orders at different times . edamame is usually severed warm or hot , it was stone cold . the sushi was horrible . eel sushi is always served warm , again ice cold . this is likely the worst meal i have ever had in canada . never go back .
asian	food was cold . and old . if you like eating bad leftovers that have been reheated time and time again , you will love this place . restaurant was filthy . and while we were there the manager actually turned away a party of 5 because they wanted to sit at an 8 top . the restaurant was 3 / 4 empty and this was friday night at 6 : 30 . save yourself and never come here . can i give it less than 1 star ?
asian	just ... everything is gross . limp , oily , unsatisfying meals . i 've never seen the place with more than a handful if people in it , so that should tell you something .
asian	we also asked about the lunch special being as it was 2 : 55 ( dinner price begins at 3 ) . she said no it was dinner time . i didn 't want to argue with her but throughout the meal she was extremely rude no matter how kind we were to her . the food came out at a reasonable time and was decent . but the service from that particular waitress is why we will never return .
asian	we paid over $ 20 a plate when we sat at the fancy hibachi table - okay , fine - there 's the show & a decent amount of food . but tonight , we sat at a regular table & paid $ 9 for a scoop of rice and $ 18 for a half of a chicken cutlet with an even smaller scoop of rice . the food is good , but not that good ! come on now !
asian	beyond slow service , waiter forgot to bring us items at least twice , sprite tasted like dirty water .
asian	ordered pickup today . was told through email and yelp it would be ready in 10-35 minutes . sent my son to pick our two meals up which totals $ 36.00 . he went in and told them that we had a to go order to pick up and the man rudely told him to cancel the order that they wasn 't going to fill it ! ? my son being the shy person he is didn 't question it and called me as he left but what the hell kind of business is this ? ! if you aren 't fulfilling my order then call me and don 't waste my time ! horrible service ! ! !
asian	unbelievable ! ! ! my friends mom paid for about $ 80 of the tab in cash and they still ended up charging for those items in the final bill . the manager continued to argue with us and would not take responsibility for the restaurant 's error and lack of respect . it took the server about 20-30 to check on us each time for water / wine . i will never ever go back there again and i will make sure to discourage other people i know to go there . it was my friend 's bday and they made it into a stressful experience . i 've never experienced such a lack of customer service and respect in a restaurant .
asian	we will not be returning because of the service . the karaage was supposed to come out as our appetizer , ended up coming out after our ramen ( wtf ? ) and it wasn 't even that good . bf kindly asked the server if she could bring us edamame instead . she replied by saying " we 'll sir , we already made this for you . " ok . i work in a restaurant , i know that 's not how you treat your guests . she ended up coming back to our table and asking if we wanted the karaage taken off the bill . well obviously , we only ate one piece . ugh . shame on you , fukumimi .
asian	i wasn 't expecting authentic ramen , but having surveyed a few different at-home ramen packages , they could have improved the taste even with slightly better store-bought varieties . the gyoza we shared were pretty stiff and stale . not sure about the other items on the menu , but if you 're going to call your restaurant noodleholic and make a large bowl of ramen your logo , they may wanna up the quality level . it 's quite inexpensive , but you can easily find better for this price point .
asian	fishcakes were fine , might even say good . tom kha was watery instead of creamy . soup tasted like spicy water . afterward , got sick . i 'll assume it was the " soup . " not going to bother giving this place another try , too many other thai places in vegas .
asian	the rice was not heated enough and therefore not crispy . when we brought this to the attention of the sever we were told to have indicated we wanted it crispy . is crispy rice not the whole point ? toppings were so so ... broccoli has little place within this dish . soft shell crab was tasty but brought out in a straw basket and not worth 12 $ . service was sparse ... we were brought our food and not visited by our server again . also .. the air conditioning was shut off and a fan was turned on in our direction . the restaurant could use a clean up !
asian	taste is not terrible , but definitely not up to expectation . it 's a chain restaurant , so not authentic for sure , not even in the bbq all you can eat . we were 5 guests and all our dishes came at separate times , service is meh . no kim chi refill lol really ? veggie ramen is flavorless ... if you 're super desperate for korean food , then yeah this is acceptable . otherwise , i suggest try something else
asian	kare-kare is rather blunt . my friends who ordered chicken inasal and pancit bihon seem to be okay with their food. super slow .... like min 1 hour wait. don 't sit on the second floor. very noisy , you can barely hear each other lunch menu is very limited waitress / kitchen messed up our order ........ will mostly not come back again .
asian	it 's unfortunate because the orange chicken has always been my favorite even though they have downsized their portions , my chicken was smaller than i ever remember . big buddha has officially topped my " do not eat at list "
asian	i would have appreciated an invite with discount on second meal , but maybe managers need more training on the customer willing to give feedback rather that just not come back .
asian	asked multiple times if we wanted more food , at least 3 times . we ordered 2 big meals , plus appetizer , it 's enough . then the push for desserts , multiple times . left feeling awkward and slightly annoyed . felt like a nail saloon that harrasses you for extras w manicures , pedicures . some days it feels like it 's best to just not leave the house ..
asian	although food is not bad , the service is horrible ! when i complained weird taste of the food , and i said i came here for some authentic hong kong cooking , the waitress said " this is fusion food ! " oh please ! this is typical dirty chinese restaurant that is adding weird stuff on their menu . and the waitresses ended up speaking foul language in chinese cursing about me ... will not return ! ! !
asian	always eat ayce japanese restaurant in mississauga area ; tried to find a real and better quality japanese restaurant . after checking the reviews , decided to try this place . we ordered the medium sashimi tray and the udon soup . there are only 4 different kinds of sashimi , they were cut into different sizes ; some thick , some small , very unprofessional chef . the udon soup has no taste at all . i don 't know why other people left good reviews for this fake japanese food restaurant . will not go back for sure , it is worse than ayce .
asian	menu changed since my last visit . they no longer have the chix sandwich with grilled pineapple and teriyaki . ordered a rice bowl . didnt like the chix in it . tasted like the already cooked chix u buy in the freezer section of the grocery store . they are still generous with the veggies which is a plus . decided to be daring and try a different sauce-the peanut one . it didnt hav much flavor . wish i had picked a different sauce .
asian	the hibachi is cooked then covered in teriyaki sauce which is not on the menu . the chicken was cooked plain then dumped into the teriyaki sauce . the waitress forgot the soup and salad . when i told her that the teriyaki was not on the menu and is not typical for hibachi . she came out with the more traditional sauces and said dip in that . i would not come back here maybe try the sushi . the mixed green salad was only ice berg . they have us 10 % off . would give zero stars .
asian	been to this restaurant 3 times over last year . rice for sushi was cold with some parts of rice uncooked . the raw fish ( nigiri sushi ) was bad , i think they gassed the fish with carbon monoxide to look red , but bad texture . raw fish on nigiri sushi pieces were cut small like they were trying to save money . although service at goyemon has always been poor , it makes it worst when the food was terrible . we brought 4 guests bragging about this restaurant and our credibility was shot . i don 't think i will be going to this restaurant again when i go for my semi-annual trips to the orleans hotel and casino .
asian	won ton soup was oddly orange , and tasted like plastic . when we asked why it 's orange , the owner said " i 've owned the restaurant for 30 years . " well she said it 's just food coloring . nasty since no other place does that . she just was being defensive . lo mein was just average . i will not be coming back .
asian	according to the wsj , the chef lived in japan for 12 years and worked for a ramen restaurant . the portion size was expensive , the bowl presentation was not attractive , and the broth was just terrible ! ! ! if they where in chicagoland area it won 't last . i think the chef need to go back to japan and learn how to cook ramen . i definitely prefer ramen kid over ramen station .
asian	we sat at the front table and ordered sushi . while the hibachi area was packed we did not anticipate a long wait for sushi . the server took our order and never came back . we ordered a few rolls and they slowly started coming after a 45 minute wait . the manager apologized but very insincerely . i believe he is a sushi chef and certainly lacks management skills . the final roll came 50 minutes after we first ordered and it was wrong not once but twice . very disappointed and will be hesitant to go back - at least on a sunday night with an inexperienced staff .
asian	as most reviewers have noted the food is not good and it is way overpriced . lowlight of our meal .... my daughter order the bbq pork noodle soup . it was horrendous ; it smelt and tasted like a bad fish market . find any other restaurant . don 't waste your time or your taste buds .
asian	the fact that i chose them based on their website stating they are trying to compete with khdbj made me opt out of the other top choice to go with them . the meat quality is subpar . service was okay . we got the beef combo . the kalbi was the only decent cut . but it 's pretty tough to get that wrong . also added ddokboki and lets just say i took one bite and left it untouched after that . seriously don 't understand why the high rating . the banchan was also underwhelming .
asian	on the guestlist and in ' girls only ' line on a saturday nignt for 3 ( ! ! ! ! ) hours to finally get in ... club is mediocer , nothing special , not worth the wait or the hype ... ok ok calvin harris made up for it a bit , still would not recommend it .
asian	quick take out service . really flavorless food . so disappointing . it is hard to make take out noodles tasteless . maybe it is because we ordered it with no msg ? i don 't know , but i won 't be coming back here again .
asian	portions are minuscule , food is tasteless , wasted my money .
asian	no staff to greet us tonight . we just sat down and hoped for the best . we sat down . still no one approached us . we got up and went to the buffet . the rice was mass produced in a rice steamer . very tacky . the desert was mixed with main foods . the quality of the food was 5 out of 10 . will not go back .
asian	unduly expensive stuff and very poor quality food . if still anybody wants to go they might be on their own risk but my recommendation would be no no no no
asian	beef was disgustingly dry . i had a few pieces that was just all fat , quite chewy too . the interior is nice , service is rushy , the food was not good so won 't be returning .
asian	oh and if you decide to complain that the wait time is too much , they will throw the drinks and chop sticks at you . especially a asian old lady called jay she will be extremely rude ! beware of jay ! ! !
asian	kirin ichiban is on tap , but its $ 7 per beer ! not great but it is nice to have a sushi bar in the airport .
asian	they got you hooked though if you 're from out of town because it 's hard to find ' real ' places to eat ! rolls don 't taste like much of anything although the garlic edamame was fried and delicious . makes you wonder why places like this invest so much $ in ' the show ' and apparently so little in the food !
asian	tasted good but i was still hungry after numerous plates of foods , i won 't go back .
asian	i ordered dry pho with grilled chicken and spring rolls . the chicken tasted dated and on the brink of going bad . the spring rolls were very crunchy ( good ) but the meat inside tasted dated , too . the noodle was okay though .
asian	small location expect wait $ 15 min credit card charge . pineapple fried rice , radna , and pad kee mao wasn 't great .. it would suffice as a hangover cure , only if you 're able to drive here . it 's a bit far off the strip where chinatown is . i 've had better thai places . they were however super nice enough to accept reservations though .
asian	xo is just steps away , go there instead and save yourself from a terrible meal .
asian	i had the pho dac biet " special pho " and the beef was precooked and rubbery . don 't even get me started on the spring rolls . only protein inside , two pieces of shrimp in each and they were the size of little hostess snacks . i had a zoolander moment when i saw the food . " what is this a meal for ants ! " disappointed and won 't be coming back . only positive , very nice wait staff .
asian	i 've cooked ohio city ramen a thousand times . they claim to use ohio city ramen . what they sent out was a watered down broth with spaghetti in it . when we asked the bartender about it , she tried to tell us it was ohio city ramen . it was most certainly not . if they ran out and had to make due with spaghetti , i get it . it sucks , but i get it . what i don 't get , is that they tried to lie to me about it . i 'm angry now . headed to a restaurant that serves actual ramen .
asian	service was good though . can be improved . prices are good not very expensive . they are better hakka places in toronto though
asian	i waited over 30-minutes for what was supposed to be a quick lunch . didn 't leave until an hour later and late to work . here 's the thing , las vegas has a huge thai community . therefore there are many thai restaurants where the food is just as good with far better service and efficiency. normally i don 't do this but as i was walking out and people were walking in , i recommended they go elsewhere if they we hungry because of the wait time .
asian	i went to buy shrimp and the fellow in the back was grinding chopmeat he came up front did not take off gloves he just rinsed his gloves in the sink and then picked up my shrimp . im a retired exec chef and pastry chef in manhattan 40 years and know most health codes and i know this was a violation . i guess because it was late there wasnt a manager on premise so the employees might get lazy . ill be watching now to see how common this is or is it just random .
asian	staff are great but everything else is pretty weak other than the noodles which are really really good . the spring roll , egg , hot and sour soup and the kung pao all look the part but it 's all monotonous with little variation in texture and taste . e.g you could make this from walmart ingredients and get the same kinda shiny sauce for about the same cost it 's not going to kill you and for lunch at a reduced rate may get to 2.5 to 3 but there 's just way too many good places nearby to consider this as a repeat visit .
asian	had some stuff normal chinese buffets don 't have . it was worth a try , but don 't except it to be great .
asian	had to wait 45 minutes to get a table . prices were very fair for las vegas standards and the portions were humongous ( none of the three people in our party finished their plate ) , however the food was not up the same before mentioned las vegas standards . meat in both our curries was extremely hard ( i would call it a shoe sole in german , not sure if that translates to english though ) . i am still marveled how you can produce a tough chicken inside a curry . our weakest meal while we were here .
asian	ross you where selective with guest . after you rudely treated us and now give us excuses . we watched you question nobody after us . weak ! ! ! ! ! ! ! no help to downtown ! ! ! !
asian	never again ! this place made me feel heavy and sick to my stomach . either we had a bad batch or came when the food wasn 't fresh but i was not satisfied . sushi shouldn 't make you feel heavy . there was just too much sauce and rice . we couldn 't even finish what we ordered because it just made us full and sick quick and there was 5 of us . we barely ordered 2 items each . it 's all you can 't eat . we had to pay for the waste . so not worth it !
asian	- pork slices was good unfortunately due to my stomach cramps followed by greasy bowel movements , i cannot give this place more than 2 stars
asian	see picture . when i called to tell them there was a black hair in my food they said i was lying and only saying that because i was mad . i told them to refund my money , and they said i could not prove it was in the box before i left the restaurant . i will be disputing the charge with my bank and never going back there again .
asian	no need for me to go on about any review ! so grossed out ! ! ! ! !
asian	the service was too fussy , the server kept coming back every 2 mins ( come on , we were literally the only customers there and you can tell when ppl finally pull their curious noses out of the menus ) . the food was ordinary , i did like their appetizer dumplings sample , but as for the rest , honestly i experienced better flavors in much cheaper and less fancier places .
asian	staff is really nice and attentive but the food just sucks . my meal consisted of everything from being not fresh to undercooked . quality is just terrible .
asian	appetizers were good . calamari was yummy . that 's where it ends . got 4 different rolls . none were memorable . stopped eating them because the taste was off . server was too busy doing her side work to leave to take care of us . sodas stayed empty , no check backs but she cod ask for the soy sauce on the table to refill with the rest . it was only 8pm and they close at 10 . won 't be back .
asian	blah . blah . holy shit ! $ 13 for that ? and $ 17 for this ? hmmm ... i think its cheaper to go across the street to safeway ... might be better quality also , just saying think about it
asian	blahhhhh .... looked way better then it tasted .... under cooked noodles , over cooked meats ..... no thanks ... wont b coming back ....
asian	dirty tables , dirtier bathrooms , mediocre food . i love hot n sour soup but not this strange tomato based odd one . kids got typical diner food . it was adequate . shrimp spring roll .. deep fried cabbage with no shrimp and dripping with oil . gross . none of our food came out together and it was mostly left on the plates . yuck
asian	i had the same exact meal as tonyf mentioned in his review , the spicy thai chicken lunch special , and was thoroughly bored by it . you call that spicy ? i call it bland as hell . it was one of the most disappointing lunches i can remember ! i request a do-over ! service was fine , nice staff , and they got me the food very quickly . but supremely boring food with not a lot of flavour . i 'll go elsewhere .
asian	i went here for my birthday hoping to try a great sushi spot for the first time . i was unimpressed . shortest happy hour ( 4 : 30-6 ) i 've seen . usually for some delicious sashimi it will cost me around 10 $ . theirs was much higher and so were the rolls so it 's just not worth the cost to me . there are some great sushi spots close by that really out-do this one .
asian	kinka is going downhill . tonight i was served salmon tataki that was not fresh and on a cold plate , as if it was leftovers from the previous night . then an okonomiyaki with raw batter inside ... when i told the server ... she just responded with a " no . " a server took away our dishes with food still unfinished . being a long time supporter ... quite disappointed in my experience tonight .
asian	oily broth with no taste . i had to keep adding sesame chili oil to my ramen in the hope of adding flavor . still didn 't help . very mediocre . server was pleasant , though . loud rock music playing to give it a hip atmosphere . is very convenient to the blue line . you can almost touch the trains .
asian	overpriced , poor service , and mediocre chinese food . i was very disappointed by all the dirty tables that had not been cleaned . i get a couple tables , but it looked like they needed a bussed more than a wait staff . food was too expensive for what you got and i would have preferred a chinese to go place . hate to be a debbie downer , but hopefully they will get their act together . the building is new and beautiful , but even that couldn 't make up for poor service , dirty tables , overpriced food , and small portions . i will not be back .
asian	people from work really like to go here and i try something new and every time i decide to try something different . i 've not found anything that is particular good or bad , just blah . the service tends to be a bit slow and surly . the prices are reasonable . the menu is huge . usually that means either there are lots of ingredients in common or the ingredients are not fresh . here it 's both . i 'll never opt for this place considering the options around , but i won 't veto it either ... i 'll just keep trying different things until i find the least not delicious one for me .
asian	got a chicken pho and the chicken was rock hard . it was a take out order otherwise i would have sent it back . they only take cash so be aware you 're going to have to pull money out if you were thinking of using a card . the atm only charges you 1.50 so it 's not super inconvenient to use their atm in the store . i wouldn 't go back except to maybe pull out cash ...
asian	terrible . not very many options unless you like raw seafood . not a good place for a sushi beginner .
asian	that 's how to best describe the sushi at sushi rock . why go here when you can get actual good sushi at pacific east or wasabi just around the corner ? just because the name says sushi rock doesn 't mean that you rock because you eat here .
asian	been here a few times when family comes in from hawaii , they get coupons to eat here , so we will come along . today , it was very bland , nothing stood out as exceptional and everything seemed to taste the same . i don 't know if it was me , but i didn 't want to go back for more . the quality has certain gone down hill .
asian	this might be a good place to go if you 're drunk and don 't care about the quality of sushi you 're eating but if you 're sober and is somewhat coherent about what you 're putting in your mouth then don 't come here . i ordered the sashimi plate and what came out were these poorly cut tiny pieces of fish on top of giant mounds of shredded daikon . sashimi is all about the way the fish is cut and whoever cut these pieces were either highly untrained in sushi making or wanted to save the restaurant some money by using the end pieces of the available fish . terrible . oh and the red lighting of the place gave me a headache .
asian	this panda express has a gross restroom ( or disgusting customers who urinate all around the toilet in the ladies restroom and don 't bother to flush either } . either way , you can judge a restaurant 's cleanliness by their restroom too . i also observed the employee using the same cleaning towel to wipe the chairs to wipe down the table with . double gross ! i am feeling nauseous from eating there . i went to check their rating inspection on maricopa ( dot ) gov site , they usually get a 's and b 's . i still wouldn 't eat at this location again .
asian	tried this place with a girlfriend of mine and the groupon couldn 't save this place . unfortunately the sushi and rolls were poorly executed . the advocado was not at all ripe , super hard . lacked in flavor and sauces , which made it dry to eat . the quality wasn 't there .
asian	went there for lunch and it seemed it was all about cutting costs and saving money . lunch special was full of upcharges ... just charge a dollar more for the special to begin with instead of having the little note that says this and that and the other will cost you a dollar more . a sashimi platter would be nice as well . the spicy tuna roll was good but the rest just seemed like fluff . a potsticker that was chewy and a spring roll that was laden with grease . perhaps it was just an off day with the food , but the menu could use some revamping .
asian	why are you here , when you could be literally next door at himal chuli eating the same food for less in a friendlier atmosphere ? doink , only go here if you want to impress your business partners , not if you want to actually enjoy yourself .
asian	their siu mai , wonton soup , hot and sour soup , shrimp noodle , and fried shrimp wonton were bland and def wasn 't worth what they 're priced at . horrible dim sum .
asian	i ordered the sish tawook plate . the fries likely were from a freezer bag , the tomato was colourless and the lettuce was limp . the chicken was merely ok . the whole ordering system is time consuming as well : after being seated you decide what to eat then have to line up at a counter to place your order and pay . if you decide you then want something else ( which you won 't because the food sucks ) , you have to get up and line up yet again . the food is food court quality at best . save your money and go somewhere else .
asian	good price but crap food filler. save ur 5 bucks and go spend 2 more bucks around the corner at mei mei 's for some fine vietnamese pho instead ! ka ka yucky is more like it bleh !
asian	there other location is okay but this one isn 't better and not even as good . dumplings lack flavour and taste made from frozen ... the dumpling wrap is a bit too thick . the xiao long bao is bland as well . service was good though , except they don 't take credit cards ! it was a rare day i brought my cash wallet otherwise i never bring out my debit or have cash on me . not going back !
asian	all the dishes that should have been served hot were luke warm at best ( fried rice , chicken teriyaki , beef ribs ) . the white tuna with mango roll was the worst . rolls are normally served cold but this was not and the mango was actually a warm sticky mango sauce . nothing was fresh and that is my biggest issue . i expect fresh made food when i go to a sit down restaurant . very disappointed .
asian	no sushi either would been happier to loose my money on one spin at the roulette table ..
asian	quality has gone down over time and worse when ordering through delivery apps ( orders are always missing something , instructions not read properly ) much better choices coming up around the area . no thanks anymore .
asian	came here to have classic korean dinner , appalled at how expensive the meat dishes were , ended up ordering soup . i ordered the beef rib soup and it tasted like water . my mom ordered the dwenjang chigae , and it tasted like slightly seasoned water . the only star i 'm giving for this is for the variety of side dishes and the refills of those side dishes . go to owl instead .
asian	i ordered the wonton soup and moo goo gai pan . pretty disappointing and overpriced . i will definitely try the other nearby chinese place next time , which is supposedly flavorful and cheap . don 't waste your money here .
asian	i can 't think of a reason to ever go back . that being said if you are in the mood for something that has vaguely asian flavors at an average price point , in a normal amount of time , this place is passable .
asian	got there no one was in there at all ! empty restaurant in a shopping plaza well figured out why the food absolutely sucks ! won 't be returning wasted $
asian	bland and not memorable we had some sort is tower thing but i don 't even remember anything else that 's not a good sign
asian	had the kung pao chicken w / fried rice lunch special . fried rice was just rice with a little egg . although the portions were generous it had no taste . friends had the hot and sour soup that was cold .
asian	i had the salted fish & diced chicken fried rice and the fish and tofu hot pot , and both were very disappointing . rol san makes a much better salted fish & diced chicken fried rice ( though still not authentic / up to snuff ) .
asian	not sure how it 's possible to get the basic kung pao chicken , egg roll and vegetable chow mein completely tasteless but this place did it . we added a ton of soy sauce and chili but that didn 't make it more palatable . it 's unfortunate as this place is in a great location .
asian	seems like they cater to the non flavor people . never coming here again
asian	bland , bland , bland . not something that chinese food is supposed to be . i had the chive pancakes , the pan-fried buns , and shrimp , pork , and chive boiled dumplings . not even a hint of seasoning between the three of them . i 've had authentic chinese food on four continents , and i have never had chinese this under-seasoned before . oh , and they didn 't squeeze the liquid out of the chive pancake filling , so watery juice either spurted out of the pastry or dribbled down your chine when i bit in . eurgh .
asian	had the chicken pad thai , was dry and lacking in flavour . texture was decent enough . quick delivery tho ! : ' ) was fairly inexpensive as well . which , you get what you pay for ...
asian	i got this the other night , and i was left disappointed once again by vegas chinese fare . i got kung pao chicken and could barely taste the chicken , and the sauce might as well have been water for all the flavor it packed in it . that being said , it was hot and didn 't get me sick . but still . very disappointed !
asian	i 've eaten a lot of generic chinese food in my time . something as basic as chicken balls shouldn 't be that hard , yet somehow this place messes them up ! i 've gotten them at different time just to see if it was a one-off occurrence . nope ! i found a better chinese restaurant a few minutes up the road .
asian	do not waste your money ! talk about a surprise when you walk in to a nightclub like bar .
asian	we ordered delivery and everything has no seasoning and we ordered stuff loaded with sauce and ingredients that should have taste . even the egg roll had a weird taste like old oil . only thing good was the steamed rice haha . next day i threw all the leftovers in a frying pan and made my own stir fry which tasted way better .
asian	just ordered pickup , ate a few bites , and then went to go make my own food . i ordered my entree with garlic sauce and specifically ordered the " spicy " option . tasted like bland mixed vegetables with no spice or seasoning of any sort . the soup was equally bland . we typically order from another place down the road and will be doing so in the future as well .
asian	you could really just walk down a few blocks and spend less for better food . i think the only people that like the food are vegatarians since they have fake meats . their sauces literally are all the same , their curries are bad , and everything is way more expensive than it should be . their new facade is ugly as can be too . it looks like someone used some old floor tile from a kitchen and used it as brick for the front of the building . looked way better before . d-
asian	everything tasted the exact same . the pad thai had no flavor . the egg roll wasn 't authentic . and the sesame chicken was dry and far too sweet . i will never revisit .
asian	the selection for lunch is terrible and their food barely has any flavor , i had $ 20 for crappy disgusting sushi , btw we ate here on family day
asian	this is the worst seafood i 've had in the valley and with their prices , cuttlefish should have delivered amazing food . the restaurant is beautiful but that 's about all that is good here . the service was mediocre and the food couldn 't have been worse . i 've never had beautiful seafood so overcooked , under-seasoned and rubbery in my life and our entire table agreed that their dishes were terrible . the spaghetti with prawns tasted like pasta , water and shrimp that were boiled for about 10 minutes too long . this is nursing home food at best . i left feeling hungry and robbed . i doubt we 'll see this place sticking around for too long .
asian	bland flavor , overcooked rice , dirty tables , and dirty walls .
asian	too americanized . been here twice and both times buffet was horrible . most of the food was start gone and they didn 't make any more even though the buffet didn 't close for 1.5 hours .
asian	i 'm not a fan of noodle houses by any means but go to magic noodle down the street instead .
asian	rice seemed stale , waiter seemed bothered by us and there was only 1 other person in there .
asian	this is not authentic indian food folks . the tandoori chicken only looks red , it doesn 't have any spices to it , i was wondering how can the chicken be so colourful yet so tasteless ? everything else that i tried on their buffet menu was pretty tasteless too . a lot of curries were just same curries with different meat options . the only thing which had some flavour was butter chicken , i have definitely had better butter chicken but this wasn 't bad . the service was okay , not bad not great . if i am in missisauga and want to have authentic south asian food , i will probably just go to cafe de khan .
asian	mongolian / stir fry is a flavorless joke ! meat looks likes been sitting there all day ! i pulled some of the frozen together beef from the bottom so i 'd feel some form of safety in consuming it . no flavor and i added every sauce they offered . sad bar consisted of 6 dressings and half a head of lettuce . we 've been wanting to try this place since moving into the area . wish we hadn 't . it 's so gross ! avoid this place , it 's geared to much older folks that have no taste buds ( no offense to the older generation )
asian	probably the worst hibachi i have ever experienced . . .i definitely do not recommend it
asian	also not the most competitively priced . i wouldn 't order from here again .
asian	chilli chicken which everyone raves about here was disappointing. vegetable forced rice , seafood noodles and beef noodles were all bland. food took longer to prepare than other restaurants even though the restaurant was empty at the time .
asian	overcooked teriyaki chicken . soggy eggrolls . note , their chicken " chow mein " does not include noodles , even though the very definition of the dish is " fried noodle . " it 's just a slop of chicken and onions .
asian	bland , greasy , uninspired chinese food ... dark and dated atmosphere ... no quality for price paid .
asian	had to eat every bit of blandness or else i would be charged extra for any blandness i left on the plate . as a " thank you for eating here , " the waitress gave our group a surprise plate of sushi , something newly concocted by the chef . we were heartened , thinking it might be some sort of dessert sushi to sweeten the palate , but no . more bland sushi , artfully decorated with ketchup . bleahhhh ! ! ! i guess they thought the americans would like it .
asian	i specifically mentioned i want extra spicy . still food turned out to be very bland . packing waa really really bad . bag was openes and as i pulled it out from my car couple of naan 's fell out and they were not properly covered in foil so got dirty and unedible . reading comment ; had high expectations and i waa very very disappointed with the quality of food .
asian	this is typical valley chinese . i wouldn 't bother coming here on my own time / dollar . can 't speak to the hawaiian dishes .
asian	" this place is not for any fan of sushi .
asian	with the kitschy interior and the music , i think this really isn 't a ' thai restaurant ' per se , but more a ' bar that you can order thai food -- not that it 's a good idea , but you can . " think about it along those lines , and you 'll do fine .
asian	my " hot " bean curd was anything but--had to cover it in sriracha . my husband 's hot and sour soup was nothing like any hot and sour he 'd ever had ( and not in a good way ) . the mushrooms looked canned and the chicken in the hot & sour soup was oddly rubbery . this place over americanizes their food and it makes me miss east coast chinese . we 're keeping our hopes up that we 'll find " our " chinese take out place in phoenix , but the outlook isn 't good if dragon palace is worthy of 4 stars ! one up side : ridiculous amount of food for a really good price .
asian	tasteless bullshit ! horrible ! ! please do yourself a favor and don 't order their food !
asian	over cooked noodles . pricy . snobby . pretentious . we decided to eat here because i thought buffet was too expensive for vegan selection only & i 'm impatient to wait for an hour in the buffet line . what a mistake . the price came out about the same & i was stuck with what i ordered . the soy bean was okay but it wasn 't labeled organic so it was probably gmo soy . disappointed .
asian	choose the broth ? they are all the same , which is way too salty . choose the noodle type ? they are the same : thin . want hot sake ? how about luke warm ? want to hear the music you heard in the early 90s ? perfect . cuz this dj can 't mix it anyway . but the service is actually , no joke , great ! !
asian	spicy means it has garlic . overall overpriced and not recommended . so sorry i hate submitting poor reviews .
asian	i was not impressed at all . i had sweet and sour chicken , pork fried rice and wonton soup . nothing to write home about . it didn 't wow me . the rice was very sticky , the soup was very bland in richness and the chicken had a boneless buffalo wing texture to it . lucky kitchen down the street is cheaper and is more authentic in taste .
asian	the saimin is close to cup of noodles type quality . really disappointed since there isn 't any hawaiian food aside from l & l. uses kraft mayo for the mac salad which is a cardinal sin of hawaiian cooking .
asian	the shrimp in the fried rice taste boiled . the spare ribs were ok . i 'm really disappointed that the rice has absolutely no taste . i won 't order from them again . i will give them a thumbs up on the food being hot , but the taste was lacking . i definitely should have read the bad reviews first . if i hadn 't of been in a hurry i would have taken this back . the people giving the good reviews must like bland , tasteless food . the people working there were nice , but they need to invest in some seasoning and maybe a new cook .
asian	they make a very lame attempt to be just like the local king of sushi , sushi loca . all the way from their name to their menu they try to emulate their much better competitor . however they don 't come even close . it was bland boring and over priced . try again krazy ass . if your this close just go to sushi loca . you wont be disappointed .
asian	this was not at all anything like real thai food . i was so disappointed after the hype on yelp . ordered two entrees , one being the typical pad thai , one being an eggplant dish . i 'm surprised to find that this place has so many positive reviews considering the food and the smells coming from the kitchen was not in any way a reminder of any real delicious thai place i 've been to . i 've had thai that was more like chinese food and this was more white food than either . would not go back again .
asian	wonton soup--sorry broth ; wonton ok . vegetable mu-shu came in what looked like a burrito . had large chunks of egg in it . more like a mexican burrito than chinese . family style bean curd was good & rather msg-laden . one-time visit place . won 't be returning . not sure what people are talking about with this restaurant being the best chinese they 've ever had . decor & ambiance very cheap feeling also .
asian	we ordered crab rangoons ( my favorite american " chinese " food staple ! ) and they were barely crisp , certainly not properly poofed from hot enough oil . my pork with peanuts was mostly other vegetables with small pieces of pork . they do not offer brown rice . the sauce was congealed and tasteless and - though we were hungry from shopping - neither my husband or i were able to eat much of our entrees . the waitress was attentive and quick .
asian	while the decor is lovely and the customer service was above average , the food was just not impressive . i was disappointed , because the menu left much to desire . if you want some seriously great thai food , try the pink pepper in mesa .
asian	a ) the place is huge but we were one of only two tables . i assume everyone else already knows something i just learned b ) the food is terrible . i mean absolutely wretched . we ordered a mix of dim sum and entrees , and only the sweet & sour soup was edible . i know reducing food waste is all the rage these days but we left at least 75 % of the food we ordered behind c ) it 's way too expensive for the terrible quality . on the plus side , the parking lot is huge
asian	can you just say this is pure disgust ? there pho broth tastes so bland that i might just as well have water as broth with my pho . on top of it shitty service does really accompanies with their food quality . the lady owner is such a b-i-t-c-h she was taking my order , and giving me attitude when i was asking about the sizes . crappiest pho place i ever been to in my life ! !
asian	i thought the restaurant was sterile looking . i felt like i was eating in a hospital cafeteria . i asked for vegetarian soup . i got a soup that tastes completely like fish broth . i asked for it to be remade without the fish sauce . i got a super hot soup when i had ordered medium . i was again unable to eat it . ordered the green curry with tofu . flavorless with hard potatoes . i will not eat here again .
asian	sorry . i try to find one positive even with places i don 't care for . the hostess was very sweet and friendly . i got food to go , but things needed to replenished at 6 : 30 and what we did try was mediocre at best . won 't be back .
asian	was in desperate need for light asian food and quick service for lunch . got neither . low grade japanese food summarizes it all .
asian	i ordered what i considered a " safe " drink , a drink which would be hard to mess up . unfortunately , the passionfruit black tea with boba was lacking in both tea and passionfruit flavor as well . it was like watery flavoring with sugar syrup . the texture of the boba balls was ok , not too hard , and chewy , but lacking any flavor ( wasn 't soaked in any syrup ) .
asian	maybe the sushi is ok , but regular dishes are pretty bad . we ordered carry out to the tune of $ 26 for two . we got dishes filled with the type of filler crappy chinese places use- huge peppers , onions , zucchinni and mushrooms ( which we requested be omitted ) and some scraps of meat . not like any sheazuan beef i 've eve seen . i expected better .
asian	the only reason i went here was because i really needed chinese food in my life but was too lazy to travel . so i went right down the street . the food visually looked appealing but flavor totally escaped this place . i guess , salt , pepper , broth , onion and any other seasoning is not allowed here . i was so super disappointed . save your money and just go to the usual place that you go to and avoid this disappointment .
asian	chicken was poorly seasoned , rice was not as flavourful as it should have been , and the sauces were inauthentic . i 've been eating hainanese chicken since i was in elementary school ; this isn 't how it 's supposed to taste . also , the portions were small for the price . i did like the melon soup , though .
asian	bleh .... coming from philadelphia area and having been to a very good szechuan restaurant in dc once .. the food here isn 't that good and all ... come on pittsburgh this is your most authentic ?
asian	i landed in toronto late monday night and after checking into the hotel i decided to walk around and grab take out rather than waiting on room service - the signage looked intriguing but i should have been discouraged by the fact that there were no one in the restauarant . i ordered a combo dinner --total disappointment . nothing looked or tasted fresh . the suhi rice tated slimy .. i am still kicking myself that i didn 't check the reviews beforehand ..
asian	so disappointed . had the spider roll ( $ 16-ate you serious ? ? ? ? ) and nothing was fresh . usually i don 't comment on yelp , but i really had to this time because nothing tasted good . booo
asian	1 / 4 way through my soup i had to stop and just eat the noodles. and even then it was too oily. not much flavor. tried the chicken salad. dressing was ok .. but there was ice in my salad. why ? who knows .. but it wasnt like frozen from the lettuce or anything. just cubes of ice ... i 'd rather wait for ichiza .. cuz they have much better food .
asian	new menu and changed their recipes for their ramen broth . this place went from delicious to is less than so-so . they also got rid of their combos lunches ( ramen + chasiu rice bowl + dessert ) . now , there is only ramen and it 's not very tasty . gone are the days of rich tonkatsu or miso shoyu broth . now it 's a diluted broth with soggy starchy ramen noodles . for excellent ramen broths , i 'd go to jinya , monta , or sora .
asian	overpriced for a teriyaki bowl and a drink . total is $ 11 + . it 's close to work and this place is new so i gave it a try . i won 't be back if not for the free bowl coupon . if i am craving for chicken and rice i will just go across the street to house of leng .
asian	the only enjoyable part of our meal was the odd couple seated next to us . but the food was awful . we 've never gone back since .
asian	the seaweed they used in the sushi was chewy and gross . i had to take it out it was so unappetizing . i would not go back for sushi . the restaurant smelled weird too ... like floral cleaner . it wasn 't too inviting . i 'll stick with going to sushi kee where the sushi is done right and it is always amazing .
asian	this place looks pretty rough , but it 's been here for a long time and i was thinking that the food must be pretty good if it 's survived that long . wrong . i 'd say that at least half of my hunan chicken & shrimp combo went in the trash . i could 've done better with panda express and i 'll be eating a bowl of cap 'n crunch in hour or two . fortune cookie : desire , like the atom , is explosive with creative force . in bed .
asian	this place sucks . ordered the pho bo . soup was really bland , almost like drinking clear water and the beef was dry . on top of that , the " large " size would be a small at other more casual pho place . this is definitely one of the more americanized vietnamese eateries in phoenix . if not for their 50 % grand opening discount on all dishes ( even though it 's been open for so many months now ) , i probably wouldn 't consider trying this place as the base price is over 7 $ for the large pho . there are more decent places out there , such as khai hoan in tempe .
asian	went for lunch today , and was not impressed with the quality of the food . nice atmosphere , and the service was good , but the sushi was not . the rolls were bland and all tasted the same , with the exception of the tempura yellow tail roll that tasted exactly like tuna noodle casserole in a sushi wrapper . not exactly what i was hoping for . i know good sushi is hard to come by in this area , but this was just not good at all .
asian	first of all - the all you can eat deal used to include the uni , and toro , as well as a few other special items - now - you can order only 1 per person . secondly - when i was there on tuesday sept 6th - they were out of everything ! no toro , no uni , no whole hamachi . what a waste of a meal ! it was not worth it without these items ... i feel deceived ! i will not return .
asian	but the management and restaurant have no idea what 's going on . everything is dirty . we ordered 8 dishes and only 7 came out . the server kept asking the kitchen for it , we could hear the yelling , but it didn 't come until the very end of our meal . when i tried to complain to the manager about having the late dish taken off my bill she tried to pin it on the server . it was not the servers fault . the restaurant is unorganized . food is decent but not worth the extravaganza
asian	unfortunately , it is a far cry from the likes of ten ren , chatime , and go for tea . its flavoured milk teas taste like bubble tea packages from t & t and its ambiance is largely unappealing .
asian	girl who answered the phone pretended to be the manager and said all they could do was replace it . so you expose people to unknown diseases and your solution is to just replace it ? then the next girl who got on the phone first gave a fake name then changed her name to sarah when i repeatedly asked her if she was the manager . next complaint is to the health department !
asian	we saw the place on restaurant makeover a few years back . so we went there . the problem with the food was apparently that it was bland . the tv show chef showed her how to cook with flavor . in other words , at least bust out the salt and pepper . well , i guess the girl in the kitchen forgot whatever they showed her . our food was so bland , i asked the waitress if she could take my food back into the kitchen and add some cooking oil . it was awful . never went back to the place . no thanks . and my date wasn 't impressed either .
asian	the food is below substandard - everything is drenched with soy sauce , the fried rice is made up of old , stale rice , and the meat dishes use the cheapest , darkest cuts . if you order a dish mixed with vegetables , you bet you get 10 % meat , 90 % giant chunks of onion and green pepper . do yourself a favor , don 't eat here .
asian	blowfish sushi in vegas , disguised by a different name. save your money
asian	extremely great quality seafood but asinine prices . i guess it 's another way for their patrons to feel super hollywood exclusive by paying double or triple fair market value . my first time here was my last time . plenty of other options popping up all over the charlotte area that procure the same quality seafood but charge 1 / 2 to 1 / 4 the price . enjoy subsidizing these guys ' lease with every pound of seafood you buy !
asian	blu basil has left the building ....... saw they were vacant today ....... they are closed !
asian	the table behind us waited 2 hours according to the waitress who laughed that off ! unbelieveable . don 't go ..... try ah-so sushi on pebble creek ... we won 't go back ! that 's for sure .... there 's the fish the sea ! !
asian	the menu had mostly cooked sushi options . the sushi was okay , not great . we got a spider roll , tuna roll , and an eel roll . the rice seemed a little over-cooked and gummy . they were generous with the amount of tuna in the tuna roll . we also got squid salad and crab wontons . the squid salad was average . the crab wontons were petty good . they come with a plum sauce that had the texture of apple sauce . tasty , but strange .
asian	i 'm not used to getting cocktails with my sushi . i cannot remember anything outstanding from this place , nor can i remember anything that me and my party ordered here . if you love sushi , try fresh wasabi in glendale or hiro sushi in scottsdale . you will be glad that you did . it 's cheaper and tastes better .
asian	had yakisoba .. too much sauce & it tasted like japanese bbq . sake was good , shrimp cooked well , but no , will not go back !
asian	been going here for 4 years and it hasn 't changed .
asian	i ordered a beef and broccoli dish and it tasted strongly of fish . food was a step below what i would feed my dog . probably not coming back .
asian	you don 't leave a guide dog outside as you suggested . you so blatantly have broken the law and admitted as much to the global news interviewer . you deserve the full consequence of breaking the law , and i hope the bad publicity forces you to shut down and get out of our neighborhood . i will do everything i can to tell people about your discriminatory practise and try to reduce your business as much as possible . as a sidebar , i 've eaten here in the past and never came back due to the food being barely mediocre .
asian	it even looks a bit nasty . if you order the hot you get so many chilli skins that you have to pick the hard shells out of you soup . they charge you for drink not like other hot pot places that don 't . for about $ 22.00 a person for boiled meat no thanks very over priced . if you a big eater good luck to you they will avoid you table after a while . they do have great decor i gave them one star for that .
asian	when you think of thai and vietnamese you generally think overwhelming strong flavors . this place was horrid the chef needs to at least discover salt , a few more seasoning would also be nice but at least it wouldn 't taste just like boiled noodles .
asian	oops . the rice was still overcooked and gummy , the chicken was still overcooked and dry , the breaded dishes were still over-fried , the beef was still flavorless . and those of us who partook became what i will charitably describe as " ill . " so , hey , we did get something new out of trying it again--nausea and intestinal distress ! three strikes , it 's out , even in spite of good crab puffs and the free fried ( empty ) wontons with their cute little smiley face stamp on the bag .
asian	the decor was a bit dated and the food was mediocre . i can 't write home about the service either . while there were servers walking around with trays of drinks , plain water was a hard find and refills even harder .
asian	definitely not chicken breast they used despite their huge ad / poster clearly says " use only chicken breast . " we ordered one mild spicy and one original . guess what both tastes exactly same . kinda sweet and salty and i taste no other flavours . will not likely going back .
asian	being only a short walk from popular nicholson street it looks a bit like a stairwell from the outside and inside is as drafty as one . obviously , the vast majority of food you 'll be ordering is served chilled but i don 't want to be while i 'm eating it . there was no music or atmosphere . i can 't blame bonsai in particular for high prices for raw fish because it 's a trend in edinburgh 's japanese restaurants . however , everything was very dry , the fish felt like it had been prepared the day before so even if £ 4.50 is the average price for the smallest portion , it didn 't live up to any expectations .
asian	they have a decent lunch menu priced well for $ 8 to $ 10 you get soup and an egg roll . the food was just mediocre service was just ok ... they delivered the wrong food but they were nice about getting us the right order . unfortunately monsoon you will not be added to my regular lunch venue list ... the place was really busy so who knows maybe it was just one bad lunch and i should give it another try ... i 'll let you know .
asian	never got seated until 8 : 30pm . they let the familiae customers sit before new customers . there is no point to make reservation .
asian	and i ordered my drunken noodle with chicken and shrimp . however when the food arrives , there is only shrimp . i think for delivery order the restaurant should always double check with the order .
asian	booooo ... i never heard of a restaurant that doesn 't have takeout .. smh so i went in food was horrible worst mistake .. some people in charlotte seam like they just don 't know better .. i don 't know why the good reviews
asian	no soap in the one bathroom for employees and guests . hand sanitizer doesn 't count . especially if it 's used with water . went with gf and her mom . with only 5 other people in there they served the ladies all their dishes while forgetting my pho 3 times . its just pho . not rocket science .
asian	just found out that they took out lucky 7s and replaced it with some bs. it 's $ 11.80 now . f * * * that !
asian	where did it go ? ! the restaurant is empty and there is an eviction notice on the door ! very bad news ! i called the number , no dice . wth is going on here ? if anyone knows the new location please tell me ! stat . no fair ..... no fair ( yes , gage in pet cemetary )
asian	this place has no customer service and food us not that great ! this is somewhere you go to if you want da taste of hawaiian food but don 't expect quality or to get your stomach full . staff don 't look happy working there .
asian	slow service and crappy food . my taramind fish was cold- just asked for it to be nuked cuz i was in a hurry . sauce was too tangy i couldn 't even finish it . did i mention that the rice tasted funny ?
asian	stale dishwater china mist iced tea . had to dump it . ordered a salad that took 15 minutes to prepare because the chicken wasn 't prepared for the lunch rush . no personality behind the counter . not impressed
asian	they were playing loud hood music . " i 'm going to fu * * your bitch " playing over and over . the next song proceeded to say " nigg * this and f * * k those hoes ... " completely disgusted . this is the third time i 've been here , never have i heard such inappropriate music in a restaurant . they didn 't seem to care after i made it clear how inappropriate the music was and then decided not to order . i couldn 't believe it . never again . we didn 't stay to eat . what 's worse , on the way out- the two sushis chefs started singing the songs really loudly to annoy us .
asian	this is a place to see and be seen , but not a serious sushi destination . ra is for the status conscious , and i don 't quite understand why as it is not particularly trendy , fancy or special .
asian	bland . super nice employees and helpful in the process even though i 'm a poke veteran and told them that . not a lot of stand out options and the fish tasted a little fishy to me . no pun intended . you need to give more options for flavor , and spice , and just double and triple check on the sourcing and handling of the fish prep to ensure freshness . i didn 't get sick , and it wasn 't bad tasting , but in this business with raw fish , it 's a slippery slope .
asian	boring environment + moderate food + overpriced = chin chin
asian	boring lunch specials and i was not impressed with their pad see ew its so close to my work but i will not be returning .
asian	lacking chef talent as their sushi is heavy on the rice , very light on the key ingredients , and high priced for what it is . attractive dining room . decent service . my husband has been a sushi chef for 17 + years . if you 're craving sushi around lake norman , check out " eez fusion " in birkdale . it 's very expensive , and the rolls are very large , but it tastes so much better . they are also very good with young children .
asian	ordered the general curry with green curry and i have lots of regrets . the battered chicken was just so dense , obviously preprepared and stored in the fridge , or worse the freezer . really ? i can just buy a tv dinner instead , people . if you don 't care about the food , why do you think i 'm going to be back ? i should have had a hot dog !
asian	food was quite spicy on a 3 / 10 scale but hot peppers alone to not make an authentic , correctly-spiced thai meal . very pretty decor , though . i would go there again , for a business lunch i don 't have a lot of money to explore pittsburgh 's many restaurants right now . i 'm really bummed i wasted an opportunity on this one .
asian	sushi is mediocre . prices are expensive . rolls are of low quality and limited on fish . place is usually empty . don 't even know how they stay a float . the ambiance is clean and nice . service was average . really meh and not somewhere i would head back to unless prices were more reasonable .
asian	this underground layer is almost spooky , all the surrounding hallways smell like thrift shop or like old hospital ! idk but i don 't like it so much . and the little old lady cook is a efffing grouch ! screw this place and screw my des cafeteria too ! but when u are starving almost anything tastes good i guess ...
asian	uneventful ! told the server we were unhappy with massam curry dish they said was rated " top 10 " they did nothing to resolve the problem . all dishes were overpriced . nothing tasted unique & nothing seasoned well . bland as can be on every entree . they are a huge waste of calories and pleasure .
asian	meat is sticky . shrimp on sugar cane are just ok. the bottle of hoisin sauce is the good one , but what is inside is not the original one . better pho anywhere else .
asian	bad attitude and services from the boss and the workers . no one pays attention to what you order , even if u do tell them u want something , wait a good 30mins if ur lucky . don 't recommend people going . it 's very frustrating and bad service .
asian	the 4 star lao hot was not hot . if you are looking for fresh flavors with exotic spices , this is not the place to go .
asian	they treat customers like sh * t . they would arbitrarily charge taxes whoever they like and not charge some others at their discretion . when i confronted them they said they are the owners and they can chose to charge taxes or not at their discretion . so stupid .
asian	so 4 stars for quality and 0 stars on quantity - i found it too expensive for the quantity they serve . what really annoyed me is i ordered take out and had to rush as my car was parked on the street outside and i had to move it or i would 've paid more attention to the bill before leaving . they either overcharged me or haven 't updated the menu prices . the online menu and their ' current ' paper menu that they attach to the brown take out bag doesn 't reflect the actual menu prices for items on the bill . make sure you confirm prices when you order or you 'll get your ' being cheated ' feathers ruffled !
asian	my dad had diarrhea and i puked . we believe its from the cold taro milk tea we had today .
asian	we ordered a home chili ramen and a bbq pork ramen . taste was so so , we didn 't expect good quality from a mall 's foodcourt anyways . but serving food that are unclean / raw / with bacteria are really unacceptable ! please avoid to go to this restaurant ! good that we didn 't try their sushi or else we will be in the hospital now !
asian	both my friend and i experienced a diarrhea after having pho , though it tasted pretty good .
asian	3 hours later , both of our stomach hurts . had to use the bathroom more than u want to know . maybe it was just that day , but the interior of the place looks pretty cool and our waiter was great . would i go there again ? prob not .
asian	the drinks are small and they charge you for refills or give you stale water . was ill for a few hours .
asian	the wait staff is friendly and attentive but the food was not prepared fresh or kept at safe temperatures . we will not be eating here again .
asian	took 25 minutes for the food to arrive , and the soup was only lukewarm . not a good sign already . things only went downhill from here . the noodles weren 't japanese ramen but more like the korean variety ( soft , not curly ) , and the broth was way too salty . the pork was ok but the cold soup and wrong type of ramen had ruined it for me . seriously this was worse than frozen ramen from a japanese grocery store . i know they call themselves a sushi bar and ramen may not be their specialty , but at this price point i had really expected a whole lot better and won 't be returning .
asian	the only reason i give this place 2 stars is because the lady who took my order was very nice and polite , that 's the only pleasant experience i had here . will be taking my business to kfc down the street .
asian	the chefs have really bad temper too and were grouchy towards customers .
asian	yc 's in a better option than this place .
asian	sushi quality varies wildly . not worth the time investment
asian	it pissed me off so much both times i was there that i 'm not going to go back . also the first time i was there , my friend 's chair broke when he sat on it ( he 's not overweight ) , and the second time his chair creaked and moaned . fair warning - only the benches are safe !
asian	there have not been any issues with the hibachi chefs , but the issues with the management and the servers has made us never want to come back to this place ever again . the first time , i received my salad after the hibachi was already served . it also took us 30 minutes to get the check . the second time , our server was texting in the corner instead of providing refills and cleaning plates . she was also trying to " sneak " a photo of a famous person . highly unprofessional .
asian	wishing tokyo sushi hadn 't closed . liking forward to the next endeavor . it can 't be a lot worse than this . looking for a happy ending . suggestions ?
asian	if you want good sushi in vegas , go somewhere else ! we had the salmon box sushi customized so it had to have been freshly made but it tasted like it was prepared earlier . the rice was too cold - like it had just come out the refrigerator . we also had a salad like dish with chicken imitation meal that we were promised had a great taste with quinoa .... it tasted like fake frozen meat you 'd get at a supermarket . we tried to give the waitress hints that the meal was less than satisfactory but she didn 't seem to care .
asian	the simple fact is that they are pretty much the only chinese place for miles is what keeps this place open .
asian	owners , are you reading the reviews ? mushy rice seems to be a popular critique .
asian	the decor is faded and warn and the entire place needed to be hosed down . avoid .
asian	the store felt like they are selling leftovers . baos were hard and not placed inside wooden steam baskets .
asian	decided to try it out for lunch on a saturday . the menu was just okay . we 're spoiled with the variety offered at our local san diego haunt . ordered 3 rolls ... we never saw a piece of fish . in the middle of the rolls was a mushy substance which may have been pureed fish , not sure . very disappointed . also , they need to remove the nasty stained pillows from the booths . they were pretty disgusting . we will use our other groupon but after that we 'll not return .
asian	got home and got the food ready for dinner . i 've picked up many pho 's for dinner from many different places but this place is by far the worst . the most important part of pho 's are the soup and i cannot taste the vitnamese noodle flavor . it was more like boiled hot water with salt . very disappointed and will never waste my money there again .
asian	only one of the chicken sandwiches was spicy , none of the food was hot or fresh . ( one of the sandwiches tasted like old oil ) . the workers knew the food was subpar which is why no one answered the phone when i called . this is vegas . there 's fast food on every block . i could have gone anywhere ! wendy 's , don 't waste my time or hard earned money on food you wouldn 't want to eat yourself or serve your family !
asian	aside the fact that they only were accepting cash at the time .
asian	even supermarkets make better sushi . sorry to say but i will not be back .
asian	is just a regular deep fried wings with fries . nothing special at all . but the wings they made is like not good at all even for a regular deep fry wings . can do better at home using tfal deep fryer . the bao was ok but the water from the cucumber makes the bao become smushed and soft . the meat was also normal . overall , i would give it another chance next time since is still new but will try different stuff from the menu .
asian	bought a chicken breast that wasn 't fresh , it smells funny when we ate it. had to throw the rest away. never again for fresh produce
asian	it 's like paying a full price plus the deal that you buy online . they complicate the deal by charging you a different amount . food is ok but everything is too salty . lady server is very nice and pleasant , the guy is somewhat letting the lady do all the job and not very pleasant . not worth the money and the hassle l you pay for .
asian	we got there with a group of 6 plus 2 others for hibachi dinner . we were told what we could order , if we wanted to order something more expensive it would not cost the extra price but either $ 10 or $ 17 , wha ? ? ? since we had a table of 8 i just agreed and didn 't want to make a scene . the bill comes and we have to pay an extra $ 3.50 , we ordered what we paid for but ok . the chef was average at best an the food was below average , not horrible but below average . go somewhere else .
asian	they closed for a whole week on vacation ---nothing mentioned on their phone voicemail about closing for vacation . after wasting time and gasoline going the first time we went today---they would not accept groupon because it was expired now . go at your own risk--- but they may shut down for a lunch break of their own and not be there . very poor customer service -will never go back ! !
asian	got miso soup , teriyaki chicken and spicy tuna roll . tuna roll was probably the worst i have ever eaten . miso soup was ok . vegetables in terriyaki chicken were cold . seems like they didnt bother to steam frozen vegetables long enough . chicken was half decent . they were out off half of the stuff listed in menu . so had to keep changing the order . wont be going back again .
asian	saturday night and not very many people dinning in , that should have been sign ! ! ! overall nice looking restaurant , cool revolving sushi conveyor but service was weak and the sushi looked like it was sitting on that conveyor for a long time . i did order from the menu to have atleast something fresh . it took awhile to finally place my order and seemed forever to get it . with just a hand full of people it should have been fairly quick to receive our food . the staff seemed busy playing with their cell phones than taking care of the customers . i will not be back .
asian	when we get there and told them we had a groupon they showed us all the stuff we would not be getting with a groupon . they directed us to the much more expensive menu for groupon users . completely cancels out the idea of buying a groupon when i am just charged more for using it . food not great and definitely not worth $ 62 for 3 people . wont be back .
asian	2 minutes after we sat down and got drinks , we were told the kitchen would close soon so we need to order right away . of course i felt flustered so i ordered a sushi roll i wasn 't even sure i would like and of course ... i didn 't like it . while eating , the whole staff ( host , waiter , sushi chef , cook , managers ) stood by the bar and watched us . i 've never felt more rushed and unwanted somewhere in my life . super unprofessional and rude . not sure if i 'll even go back .
asian	the heart of palm salad came next - dressing was tasteless . rolls were delicious and served warm , then dinner was served . i chose garlic shrimp . it was , literally , 30 small sized shrimp served with a bed of mushy rice . perhaps it is taking the new chef some time to adjust but i did not enjoy the visit this time and really left disappointed .
asian	on top of that they has old food sitting the grill real old . and on top of that they were out of food , they basically threw us the menus and said sit yourself . horrible service . went to mark riches instead which is next door thank you jesus
asian	bought a restaurant.com certificate and they are out of business with a disconnected phone number and for lease sign on the doors .
asian	package said " best before aug.31st. " opened the chicken once i got home to marinade . as soon as i opened the package chicken smelled like rotten eggs . chicken clearly expired . this happened twice before at this same location but i thought maybe it was just bad luck , but now i know this isn 't the case . i suspect they re-print new ' best before ' labels once meat expires so they can sell the bad stuff as " fresh , " there 's just no other explanation to why it would have such a strong odour .
asian	bought expired food , went to return it and the owner said expired food is fine ........... hell no
asian	really bad , no taste at all for both . and the bbq guy was too lazy to chop the duck and chicken , i end up having 8-9 cube of meat in each container . their bbq meat went downhill . it used to be good . now it 's no better than those bbq meat sold in chinese grocery store but cost double here .
asian	bought here before but first time under new management , cooks are basically college or uni kids. bottom of bowl filled with water from veggies not being cooked. beef was just dry and salty .
asian	bought pork bone soup not along ago unfortunately i found a black hair in it ... not to impressed ...
asian	felt sick a few hours later . definitely have food poisoning as of early this morning . had to have been the takeout , because my fiancée and i are both sick . the only thing we shared all day was the takeout sushi . will not chance eating here again . update : was contacted by toronto public health - they are currently investigating . update 2 : this restaurant was given a yellow rating ( conditional pass ) by tph as of february 1 , 2016 due to food handling and pest control measures concerns .
asian	worst i have ever eaten , even the most basic is crap . fish not fresh . not sure how you get even good ratings . c 'mon people , before you rate some place good , try to remember where else you have tried . if you have not much experience in sushi , i can understand how you can rate this high .
asian	this place is not recommended to go to . not really a thai restaurant and is a mix of chinese food . the menu is terrible has very few items . don 't know what to say all i can say is not recommend to people 's around the area .
asian	ultimately disappointing . the service was slow and not very attentive even though we came when it was almost empty . then we ordered a variety of starters and rolls . the best thing we tried were the gyoza . they were pretty tasty but everything else was just ok . even with the groupon discount i felt like it was overpriced and i paid too much for what we received .
asian	fine print doesn 't tell you that 18 % gratuity is included with the groupon ! ! ! so two hibachi meals already equal 50 bucks so you 're screwed right there . the service was terrible the food was for dogs and the drinks were made by the bus boy . i will never go here again might even protest outside . save your money .
asian	we ordered the two meat kalbi rib combo plate with macaroni salad and brown rice to go . we got home and opened the carry out box . there was three slices of long pieces of meat . it smelled great but it tasted like sour beef . the meat was really chewy , you would think you were chewing on meat flavored gum . this had to be old meat that was sitting out re-heated and served . we threw out the meat and just ate the brown rice and macaroni salad . we won 't be coming back . i just hope we don 't get sick .
asian	seafood noodle soup seemed to have zero seasoning / flavor . did not get any sauces until we had to ask half way through .
asian	fairly disappointed . the dumplings / dim sum was soggy and unimaginative . tried the tiger skins as we were told they would be fairly spicy . nadda . the fried chicken was tasty and the waffle was a korean interpretation . the chicken was cooked well and i would recommend . our sever was very friendly but not too attentive . saw a couple strollers here which means expect to see young families as well .
asian	when i went to pick it up , the lady was on the phone for 15 minutes without even acknowledging my existence . every lunch special dish is suppose to come with a spring roll ..... but i didn 't get one at all . the soup tastes like sewage water . but overall it 's cheap so i guess you get what you pay for .
asian	had the pad thai and green curry . pad thai tasted too kechupy , and green curry too sweet . would recommend to go elsewhere .
asian	returned the food and they gave the money back . can 't believe they actually serving rotten meat .
asian	very little meat and mostly a sticky , gelatinous goo which was quite unfortunate . imagine a pie filling , but savory , and you 'll get an idea of what i 'm talking about . every other bao i have had was filled with more meat and was only slightly moist . being a visitor to montreal , maybe this is the local style ? if so , please know that this is not what bao should be .
asian	dumplings are good . spring rolls ehhhh. i understand everyone has bad days but the lady on the phone is always rude and acts like your business is an inconvenience . i go here because its convenient .
asian	i 've been here before a couple of times a few years back with my sons . since i was in vegas on business , i went out of my way and took an uber to get here for ayce bbq . imagine my surprise and disappointment when they told me that there has to be two people to order ayce bbq ! do they not like customers ? do they not want to make money ? sure would have been nice if this was stated somewhere before i spent money on an uber for nothing ! of course , i then had to order another uber to take me back to my hotel .
asian	since i was in vegas on business , i was craving ayce bbq . imagine my surprise and disappointment when they told me that there has to be two people to order ayce bbq ! do they not like customers ? do they not want to make money ? sure would have been nice if this was stated online somewhere before i went there nothing ! this was about 6 : 00 pm and the restaurant was practically empty . there was only a few customers there and a lot of empty tables .
asian	called to order crispy chicken in garlic sauce . these were their exact words ( i kid you not ) . me : " i will have the fried chicken in garlic sauce " rude chinese : " stir fry " me : " i would like the crispy fried chicken on your menu " rude chinese : " look lady you want fried chicken wing go kfc this chinese stir fry " me : beep ( censored ) i 've had it . i 'm tired of these filthy low budget chinese restaurants taking peoples money and treating them this way . i will never eat here .
asian	i am feeling good today so i will avoid giving a one star review . the food here is hit or miss . they totally jipped me on food portions . if i 'm going to freakin pay this much for fast food chinese food at least give me a decent portion . the only thing this place is good for is getting forks and spoons to put in my desk because my work believes in " going green . " this includes not providing utensils in the break room .
asian	i also had ask for a hot tea togo and the guy said they don 't do togo hot teas ? how interesting
asian	my stomach was still not right after eating here and for 2 weeks i had issues . i am finally feeling better but wow , i will never crave this place ever again .
asian	brocolli beef taste like oysters and crab ragoons seemed like the cream cheese was sour
asian	where should i start from ? nose hair on the plate , flies on the soya sauce or the rude waiter ? sushi- all we get in montreal are 9 / 10 sushi places run by chinese , fyi sushi is japanese . there are still good chinese run sushi places . this one is just a disgrace to sushi . soggy rice , frozen tempura and waiter with rude demeanour . this place is a no go . let alone be the quality , it 's nothing personal but personal hygiene .
asian	as a matter of fact , our table was wondering why the sushi was taking so long and i figured out that the sushi chef 's were trying to see how thin of a slice of fish they can put on rice , not lol . i 'm totally assuming that the chefs are doing what they are told with this horrible establishment of a japanese chain . shame on the koi management . spare yourself and do not eat here unless you like paying dearly for nothing and leaving hungry . the cumulative low rating is the best indication for this restaurant .
asian	this is the first time in 20 years that i 've ordered anything from domino 's pizza , and f- this place , i 'm never ordering from them again . i went ahead and re-placed my order , because i already tipped the driver ( more than one person ordered from here ) , it 's my f-ing lunch and i 'm at work and can 't leave , but sh ! t , now i have to stay hungry for the entire lunch rush before they 'll be able to get me my food - all because they didn 't get the order ticket . f * * kers better not charge me for the first order ! !
asian	had all the run of the mill sushi that you expect an all you can eat place to have , however past the basics , there wasn 't much . food was decently priced . service was scarce at best . overall , the quality just seemed lacking . i love sushi and this place did not rub me the right way .
asian	went there for lunch with my mom and was disappointed in the service . they forgot our appetizer and then , when we were almost finished with our entrees , they brought it out . we sent it back . they never asked us if we wanted something to drink other than water . food was very , very average . having not been here for many months , i think i 'll stay away .
asian	fried rice and ' scallops ' that had a pink color ..... not kidding . what makes fried rice pink ? and tasteless . i would never consider returning to this place . soup was mushroom flavored broth . salad would 've been ok if it wasn 't for the large inedible chunks of lettuce ' core ' . i was very unhappy leaving here . never again . scallops were irregular ' pink ' pieces that had no taste and were not cooked correctly . never again .
asian	i will never come here again . however the toro at sushi was amazing but i will never come here thanks to brady . rude ass dude
asian	all the rolls were dry and bland . the vegas roll was the worst one i have had so far . i was not really suprised with the quality . i had a feeling that it was going to be lacking , yet i still had to give them a try . sadly , the rolls lived up to my expectations . the service was great . the ambiance was decent . i did not drink this time , but i have been here in the past for reverse hh and find drink prices to be reasonable . i most likely will be back for drinks and potstickers when i want to relax after shopping at the stores nearby . but definitely not for their sushi .
asian	the manager was so kind that she said she 'd be able to move a chair to the washroom if my wife wanted to feed the baby . you don 't eat in the washroom ; why should a baby eat in one ? will never be going back
asian	when i warned suncoast via their message submission webpage - that their restaurant was making people sick - they ignored me . zero star service . by the way , as the waitress had disappeared for so long i left my money on the counter and went to play roulette . it was only after i got home i realized i was very ill . oops .
asian	that was the first thing that hit me . second thing that i got hit with is the smell . it 's not a bad smell as an wtf is that smell but rather they have really bad ventilation and your taking it home with you and then to the dry cleaners . after that i walked out . im sure the the food is ok since it 's hard to mess up sushi but ....
asian	the rest of the experience was similar . food was blah , i was disappointed with one roll in particular because the soft shell crab was obviously not freshly fried , or even reheated . it was cold , limp , and soggy . the rest of the food experience was average . service at the bar was good . too many other better sushi joints closer to my house for me to go back . bright pink ginger and best sushi in the valley are mutually exclusive .
asian	bring back rice papers. i want the full experience of all you can eat kbbq and i don 't want to get stuffed by your free rice. i have plenty of rice at home .
asian	bring back the paper to fill out your own order , instead of having the waitress write down.bring back the paper to fill out your own order , instead of having the waitress write down.bring back the paper to fill out your own order , instead of having the waitress write down . oh yeah ... and ... bring back the paper to fill out your own order , instead of having the waitress write down .
asian	i got over $ 10 fee . food so so service so so . not going back
asian	what happened to this place ? we haven 't been back to this restaurant in a few years and we went recently and was surprised that everything was downhill from what we remembered . the food was sub-par thai if you could call it that . flavors were definitely off and what really was awful was the golden curry chicken that came as a piece of grilled chicken breast swimming in a pool of yellow sauce . the chicken was just placed on top of the sauce and not even cut up or coated . huh ? what happened to the flavorful golden curry chicken i remembered from before ? service was good but the food is crap . don 't waste your money .
asian	they have forgotten items and burned my food . i am going elsewhere . china tango it is .
asian	this place is super super duper fancy , and so i expected the food to be spectacular. we ate the shabu meal which was $ 500 a person. ridiculous pricing , but you get the best , top notch quality food such as kobe beef , lobster , and live prawns. the service was excellent , but i did not find meal satisfying or out of this world .
asian	two salads , two rolls , and 4 pieces of sushi , two ice teas was $ 85 bucks for lunch . food was ok but the pricing drops this a star . service was slow and there was only two other tables going at the time . save your money and go ten minutes off the strip for much better options at better prices .
asian	broccoli beef ... the sauce was more like a gravy and the service was not very attentive .
asian	the expression on her face looked like we just murdered her family or something . when we brought it to their attention she didn 't even say sorry , again same expression . the manager came and asked if my friend cut himself with the glass , when he found out nobody was hurt he was just in a hurry to leave . this place is a joke even by asian service standards .
asian	it 's not worth it for how much they charged .
asian	everything we ordered is salty ( jook , gong chow lau ho , won ton noodle ) . overpriced . poor quality food . service was nice . atmosphere is nice .
asian	plastic string is in my food . this is the second time finding shit in my food . eatters beware .
asian	for less than half a roll i couldn 't finish .. what in the world .. i already paid 35 bucks .. and they said you need to finish your food or you get charged twice . thought she was joking .. but she started a whole arguments in front of the whole store because i didn 't want to pay twice for food i already paid for . i cannot believe the police haven 't shut this scam down . she purposely collected our our first payment as our first roll came out because she knew this whole thing is a sushi scam . wooooow never eating sushi again . oh and they charge you a mandatory 15 % gratuity
asian	broth is too salty. beef in pho not always fresh. spring rolls are not very fresh. i 've eaten here 10xs. go to tea light if u live in north phoenix. i 've given up on this place .
asian	what viet restaurant doesn 't have tai sac on the menu ? rice dishes aren 't great either .
asian	meat portions are extremely small . 1 whole meatball cut 4 times ? really ? broth is so watered down and diluted it tastes of slightly beefy salt water . disappointing .
asian	ordered vermicelli noodles with pork and the noodles were cooked and soft ; soupy . never had that in my life and my family is vietnamese . meat was the cheapest cut ... just not overall a great experience , go to another one
asian	only one piece of pork belly for $ 10 or more for a bowl of ramen soup . place is tiny so even if you put 2 to 3 people in there it would look jam pack . open concept kitchen is nice but food is just average . their soup base for ramen is not braise with pork or beef bone / marrow , i feel its not as healthy as chinese , viet and korean soup . won 't return because it 's far from where i lived and not my cup of tea .
asian	they gave me raw gyoza then instead of fixing as i reported it , the waitress proceeded to waste my time to inform how i might be wrong ( how the parboiled then grilled ) , how about check the meat when i point at it instead of running your mouth ? it took the full meal until the gyoza was returned to the table . when it was brought back , instead of giving me a new order they just gave the exact plate with a pcs i spat out . its all soggy bc i suspect they just microwaved it . wtf , so not coming back waste of money and of time .
asian	what a scan ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
asian	the food is good but the service is terrible . please do not come here and expect good service .
asian	would not recommend this place .. meats tough and not fresh including shrimp . not good value for your money ay 25.99 per person . did not enjoy the food . would not go back .
asian	asked for one package but two paper plates and she told me she would have to charge me extra . wow , no kids combo can order from and they want to charge me extra for a paper plate . never coming back here . food was ok according to my kids . thank you xia for not charging me for the extra fork .
asian	however , if you make sure to just choose something safe on the menu , you should be fine . do not order the fish egg soup or anything that sounds difficult for them to make . basically came here out of desperation for korean food near tempe . overall , disappointing especially because of the amount of overhype about this place . i know that nothing in az will ever compare to east coast or la , but was still expecting better . will keep looking for a legitimately solid korean restaurant to make our regular place to enjoy in phoenix .
asian	it was not what i expected . the dessert came out to watery . there was a hint of rice but you can 't really taste the walnuts .
asian	i can see how people around the school could like it here . the prices are decent and it 's a nice place to sit and look out into the street , but come on ya 'll ... really ? the miso soup was blah , the soda was flat , the beef teriyaki was chewy and the california roll was pitiful .
asian	sadly i did not like this place at all . i ordered the 51 which is the spicy soup bun bo hue . it wasn 't even spicy . the spring rolls . i 'd prefer to eat @ pt noodles .
asian	the chicken was probably made 4 days ago when i ate it . also all the vegetables looked weeks old . don 't spend ur money on this trash ass restaurant sorry waiter u were so kind but find a job where the people actually like the food . duck desert jade i wish there was an aj 's or some other shit in ur place . don 't buy this whack ass shit : )
asian	bland . service . mediocre . retarded server puts down four cups . two coffees and two mixed coffee / tea . doesn 't tell us which is which . no emotion . no gratitude . must be how they do it in hong kong since this is a hong kong style joint . not for me . don 't want to come back . i 'm canadian . this is canada . not hong kong .
asian	if you don 't speak japanese , you basically get ignored . food was ok , but nothing special . wouldn 't go back
asian	there 's is no reason to eat food this awful . i can 't think of a single item that was even decent . avoid at all costs .
asian	i paid $ 25 dollars for chirashi thinking it would be overflowing with different and high-quality fish . nope . four pieces of your garden variety fish ( tuna , salmon , albacore , and yellowtail ) with some tomago , ikura and avocado . i was stunned . if you charge that much for chirashi , you should be including scallop , spanish mackerel , snapper , etc. to make it worth the charge . the salad that came with the chirashi was browning on the edges and covered in what i assume was simply mayonnaise with some ginger in it . awful . i will be returning to try the teppanyaki , but i will never eat sushi here again .
asian	you can pretty much stop reading right here . the food is excellent . i have never had anything off the menu i didn 't enjoy , the service behind the bar is inexcusably rude . i know it 's hard to slap food down and crack open a beer with a grimace , but i should not have to ask the bartender thrice to be able to pay up so i can leave . love the food , i hope they do take away because i won 't be dining in again .
asian	the decor is weathered and cheap and the restaurant is absolutely filthy . on top of that the food is mediocre at best
asian	went here on the advice of someone working at a nearby business and was absolutely floored at how bad it was . ordered iced tea and it tasted like it was made from water filtered through nougat ! yuck ! my friends meal looked very lackluster . he said the meat was fine , but nothing special . i had some long noodles with bulgogi . i normally love this dish , but something was really off with this . my friend finished , we paid the bill and left . ended up at los tacos next door and was thrilled i had discovered my new favorite taco stand . island style came through with that at least .
asian	btw , the phone number is a cell phone , and their vm box is full ... if you 're trying to find your food , you might have to drive down there ...
asian	none of the dishes stood out as anything special except for the winter rolls which were excellent . the vegetable soup and coconut soup were very average . the traditional pad thai which came in a thin egg crepe was fine but nothing special . same with the other two dishes we had but whose names i can 't recall . very pedestrian thai food .
asian	we used to go to bubble republic every week . we couldn 't get enough of it , i believe this is how the rest of the west enders felt . br must have known about this so food portion went down and prices went up . yet we all stayed loyal , i finally have enough after ordering 3 drinks a large coconut bbt ( flavor tastes super sour ) , large black milk tea ( about 1.5 cm under the top ) and a large caramel pudding ( good ) all came up to 21 and change . will i ever go back , never unless i want to humor myself with expensive low grade bbt . this is definitely not a good customer focused teashop
asian	a good thing about br is that it is cafe style , and is a great place to hang out ! food is okay , some decent cheap eats ! however , it isn 't the most authentic when it comes to the classic bubble tea : black tea , or any drink that uses tea as a base because they use a tea bag , and lacks the sophistication of blending ceylon and orange pekoe tea for black tea . for tea-based bubble tea fans , i would recommend the taiwanese run shop at the chase , mississauga . very authentic black tea bubble tea , and a very yummy pudding bubble milk tea ! ! : )
asian	drinks are still delicious but the service lately has forced me to try other spots . the wait time and staff friendliness at both mississauga locations is what has driven me to not frequent bubble republic as often .
asian	in terms of ambiance , bubble republic is a lot quieter than its counterpart . the flavour of bubble republic 's original milk tea is also far inferior . price is higher . texture of the tapioca lacks the resistances of tapioca from chatime . although they are in close proximity , i would opt for chatime over bubble republic on any occasion .
asian	however , it was the waitresses that justify this rating . although it was amusing for me to watch , they usually ended up confusing up the orders and us when we asked for suggestions . also the chinese cuisine was pretty eh . i 've had better chinese fare and noodles at other places . they do have a cuban menu if people are interested in that , although i can 't really comment on how good the fare from that menu is .
asian	if the restaurant is crowded , they kick you out the moment you have finished your meal . don 't ever eat in . only upside to this is that ordering their chicken option gives you two massive drumsticks , an egg , and a small side of vegetables , which i feel is pretty value for money .
asian	awful , the use canned bamboo shoots and other canned ingredients . asked for extra spicy , instead of cooking with peppers , they give a container of hot sauce . manchu wok was 10x better
asian	budget friendly place where you get 3 curries with rice in just 2.50 $ its worth if you have no time to cook at home. and also 5 mini samosas in just 1 $ is good .
asian	they have all the american chinese dishes that many like to eat . nothing too special here . very average seating area , the food can be a mix of pretty warm to very lukewarm . the price is good but the food is sub par to meh . if you really just need some oily stick to your gut super sweet and fried chinese food for pretty cheap , eat here . if you want some good chinese food head down the street to east ocean . but for what it is , and you like cheap asian buffets it fits the bill .
asian	huge disappointment . rice was hard from drying out . veggie dishes were mushy and cold . crowded and awkward . staff is not helpful . i recommend takeout . we usually order and pick up which had been delicious . we won 't eat in again .
asian	food isnt very fresh . service was not very attentive either . very disappointing . .
asian	buffet is pretty bad , don 't know about the regular menu but i would only come back here if they overhaul the buffet quality .
asian	the quality of the food itself is so sick . no point having a meal here ... ! ! !
asian	the only thing i really loved was the fish curry and rice . the beef noodles actually felt a little off . the desserts were not that impressive either ; the best would be the fried banana .
asian	$ 8.95 lunch buffet . huge selection of sushi but on par w a buffet type taste . lots of rice , mayo and sweet sauce . they had clams and mussels in brown sauce and fried shrimp , along w boiled shrimp . a lot of fried foods ... not much fresh vegi like dishes . they did have the make your own hibachi type station . there were 4 soups to choose . oddly nothing spicy . lots of teriyaki chicken , fake crab this and that . 3-cleanliness 2-quality of food 3- quantity of selection- no spice 3-price for buffet i won 't be back but fits the public who want large selection of fried , low cost food .
asian	drove almost an hour to eat some dinner . not worth the drive ! ! there 's only a small selection of foods .
asian	it 's like a bad story retold for the nth time . when you 've had bad chinese buffet , you 've had this place . greasy noodles , coagulated beef and broccoli , browned and bruised " fresh " veggies ... please steer clear !
asian	the place is very large , simple and it has a decent amount of choices . watch out for some super salty items , they are just inedible . as for sushi , it has a bit more to choose from than others but it 's quality is average . service is rushed at times such as finishing one plate of food and then seeing my check already . still , it 's value works with the cheap price .
asian	it comes out being $ 10.14 . but since there super cheap they don 't fill out the hot table and don 't put food out unless you ask and they see a lot of people . a lot being 3 . i 've been here 5 times because i 'm a student but still not good
asian	manager politely offer an apology but i was surprised to know that this is a known problem to them . he explained that they been spraying 2 times a week but still have the problem . they should shut the place down until problem is taken care of .
asian	advised waitress , she asked me if i wanted another glass of water . # stayclassy # toronto
asian	do not eat here . check photo posted . dirty dishes everywhere . bugs in the eating area . can you imagine the rotting food in the back ? bugs in a sushi ( raw ) place is dangerous !
asian	once i saw it i was quiet to not scare the other customers . later i asked to refill my drink and she gave me an attitude . i could have made a scene but didn 't . and they didn 't give discount on the food . never again will i come back .
asian	went here the other night ... after waiting for a really long time ( it wasn 't very busy ) and we didn 't get our whole order , they have some kind of mite infestation going on . i posted a picture of the mite crawling on our table . i noticed it after i ate i just hope there wasn 't any in our food , they 're really tiny ! ! ! ahhh ew i won 't be back here ! ! !
asian	anywhere ! the so called bulgogi was so salty we had to throw it away ! saltier than the salted fries ! not sweet the way korean bulgogi is supposed to be ! unreal ! unacceptable . will never eat their food , truck or restaurants !
asian	no side dish refills at a korean restaurant in korean town ? too many choices around for me to consider coming here again
asian	waited 45 min after reservation time and left w / o being seated . not customer friendly . i don 't care if the food is good if management can 't handle their clientele . added note : tao did call me back the next day to apologize & asked us to return with their compliments . that is appreciated . tbc ! ! !
asian	my daughter was visiting from ca and told her about the freaky fast delivery and what a shame . 45 min for delivery ..... more like freaking slow delivery ! ! !
asian	i read a great review for this place and took a first date . we got the thai lettuce wraps which were the most poorly executed bland yet drippy mess ever . we also got the spring rolls that seemed like they were from costco . the portion of my yellow curry was small and it didn 't really have much flavor . to add insult to injury , this place is not very cheap . i really don 't understand what the hype with this joint is . however i will say , the service was good . our server was friendly , helpful , and on top of refills ( and up sells ) and the manager was very kind .
asian	i came here since day one . i guess they forgot about the peeps that supported them since before they even had the sign outside the front door . came for a table , not even greeted , didn 't even say hello just " there 's an hour wait . " an hour ? i get it but seriously ? you can 't even say hello , or screw you ? our group left , and all of us , which loved this place , will not be coming back . the people used to be humble and sweet now they think they 're way too cool for school .
asian	first time trying this place thru delivery . ordered a super volcano roll for $ 13 and its a serving less than the grocery store . i 'll stick with shogun at least its good and you get your money 's worth .
asian	we took our family here for christmas and the food was good , the service was ok . recently went back for my sis 's 30th b-day and the service was deplorable . they got our order wrong and before they had even fixed the issue , the staff was eating and counting tips . when we asked for a specific soup the waiter refused , saying we would not enjoy it . when i asked him why , he couldn 't give me an answer . the wine selection is embarrassing . we won 't be back . the dim sum and service is better at beijing noodle 9 at caesar 's palace .
asian	kindness remediates everything . these shrimp puffs are yummy . worth the wait . make sure you ask them to repeat the order when ordering to go by phone .
asian	was excited to find korean in our area . total disappointment . if your looking for proper korean with lots of flavor make the trek to bloor and christie . you 'll save money and eat great food . food at this place is just bland and expensive : (
asian	went in for their " grand ( re ) opening " to see what took them a month to finish as far as remodeling went . looks like paint and perhaps the loss of a liquor license ? crab legs no longer on the buffet for evening fare . $ 20 / 2 people with no option to just have water . other than that , food choices look to be the same but quality has gone downhill . bummer .
asian	maybe it 's because it 's located near brisdale . the environment is pretty crappy and staff very rude . not a place for an average decent person .
asian	bun thit nuong i order was stale when i told them about it they brought out a side order of fresh vermicille right away i m like you guy probably try to give me the old vermicelle one first , kind of pricey , guess cause it s in vegas pho was good portion size was kinda small , i can eat 2 bowl to fill me up
asian	falling apart as i get them home and to top it all off obviously since i 'm some white guy i don 't use chopsticks to eat sushi they throw plastic forks in the bag for me . thanks ! never again
asian	i think its the same place with a new name , anyone have any updates ? went to on luck after ignoring it for over 10-15 years , i should have kept on driving . very mediocre sudo chinese food , really bad food , no taste . apparently they have a following of people with poor taste buds as they have been around for a long time . i say pass on this joint . four of us went to on luck and we will never go back again . total disappointment . the egg rolls were the only edible thing and you need to douse it with hot sauce . they only have hot sauce in little envelopes and they call themselves a restaurant !
asian	i attempted to go to this restaurant twice to use a groupon . both times the business was closed , even though their website and the phone automated machine confirmed that it was supposed to be open . horrible experience considering the walk to this restaurant is 30 minutes both ways in the freezing cold !
asian	at 8 : 55 they flashed the lights on and off so that patrons " get the hint " to leave . at 9 : 05 they basically escort you out the door . foodwise , i had the yupha 's seafood feast and it was horrible . will never return .
asian	waste of time trying to find it . please mark closed . no good good and inexpensive chinese food
asian	twice in a row i 've recieved bad ( brown and sour ) avocado . rice is stale , and presentation is sloppy . service is slow and cranky . but sushi was better at the dinner hour. dinner hour is a 3 . lunch is a 2 .
asian	we were told only 20 mins wait and it become 1 hour wait . worst service . didn 't even get a refill for our drinks . can 't do half order and you can only order one dessert . sushi don 't taste good . calamari was hard and cold . employee don 't know what the heck are they doing . manager should know better that valentines day is busy people are out to have dinner . you should 've schedule extra people .
asian	not the greatest asian food that 's for sure and a little to close for comfort with the seating arrangements ... cramped : (
asian	i think they pay more attention to the decor more than the food .
asian	the service is quick like most pho restaurants , but the quality of food is below my kind of standard . parking is also very inconvenient .
asian	unfortunately , i experienced better . this restaurant offers so little portions compare to other pho restaurants . although i do like their mango milkshake ( sinh to xoai ) . pho and vermicelli are average .
asian	barely any chicken . expensive for the sparse portions one gets at this place . dirty spot to dine with friends ! avoid . avoid bombay 's chutney . try mt everest restaurant ( 804 eglinton e ) and you will not be disappointed .
asian	we ordered " dinner " from here tonight and were seriously disappointed . let 's start with the egg rolls- i could have bought something similar at the grocery store and heated it up in my oven ; i 'm not even sure the " crab angels " had anything more than cream cheese inside of it . furthermore , i had ordered shrimp with lobster sauce was pretty clearly the shrimp with vegetables . and they don 't have beef chop suey on the menu . seriously ? really ? really ! ! ! i would have called to complain but after reading the other person 's review realized it simply wasn 't worth my time . . . we 'll never order from here again .
asian	delivery time is horrible in fact we had to cancel the order after and 11 / 2 hours because we had a show to go to . they keep telling you its on the way , the manager ( if you call him ) has the driver call you. who then maybe gives you the real story . there only 20 minutes away , i don 't know what can take so loooonnnggg . we ordered online for the discount . we have still not received our refund ! some discount ! we are now in the process of disputing the charge .
asian	i ordered their signature orange chicken and honey walnut shrimp with a side of steamed rice . all three items were super dry and flavourless . . . portions were minimal and i can tell the server was counting the pieces of chicken and shrimp spooned into my take-out box . overall the service , flavour , food quality and dollar value per portion are way below average . . . i would advise against dining here . however , if the craving persists then head to schezwan express , which in my opinion is a much superior alternative than this dismal establishment .
asian	new decor . new staff . new menus . service was so slow that we were able to look up reviews on yelp while we waited , saw the dismal change in food quality , and left before anyone even visited our table . i 'm so disappointed to know that my faithful asian fusion spot near the house is no more , but i 'm hopeful that one of the 7 ( i think ? ) competitors within 2 miles can win me over .
asian	ordered for 18 people didnt even feed 15 people . trays were not full half empty rice and veggies . i felt mislead by manager on portions and price . would have been better off to order individual bowls with discount coupons . with that being said what food we did get was good .
asian	prices may be cheap but this place is quite dirty in my opinion .
asian	read the fine print . bought this deal off of groupon hoping this would be a perfect answer for a single that doesn 't like to cook anymore . beginning this review with a positive--it was nicely packaged - when it arrived food was still frozen . but i found the food very disappointing then lo and behold here came another package that i wasn 't expecting . turns out once you have ordered , they keep sending . yikes . so called them right away cancelling , asked for a refund and to pick up the delivery , but they refused . so the package sits in my patio and rots because it 's not worth taking up space in my small freezer .
asian	the employees here are rude , disrespectful and may steal your money by " accidentally " giving you the wrong change and refusing to correct it . besides that , the food quality is okay and sometimes they only have like one or two menu items . why ? the whole place seems did functional .
asian	there are several items on menu they no longer serve and menus on items that are not even close to the picture . when asked about why items are not given , waitress states that there customers are non-ethnic therefore food quality and taste is catered to that customer base . ( this translates to a less authentic menu and dining experience ) . experience becomes frustrating and waitress response was very defensive which made for awkward moment . there 's potential , but there are also better vietnamese restaurants . doesn 't any one feel that they have the most uncomfortable chairs ? i agree with jeff y , but i 'd rather go to da vang instead . ( like this review if you agree )
asian	we have come here for the past 5 years and yesterday my husband came home with terrible food poisoning ! we have always loved this place and would brag about it to everyone we knew . this will be our last time ever coming to this place ! i hope the health department keeps an eye on this place moving forward
asian	we were looking for authentic pho after a round of golf nearby and when we saw the restaurant sign we thought we got lucky finding a pho place at this remote location . this is really a chinese restaurant trying to serve pho and thai food . very disappointed . why call yourself pho mi while serving chinese food ? ? the only good thing about this restaurant is the price of beer : $ 2.50 even for a bottle of imported heineken .
asian	wild east pan-asian bistro at carmel rd & pineville-matthews rd is advertising 1 / 2 off sushi mon-wed , but the sashimi was wafer thin and the discount doesn 't include sushi rolls . i had an average experience at a price that you would expect to pay for fine dining . if you want ... true 1 / 2 price sushi pay a visit to johnny 's red bowl asian bistro in providence promenade . their sashimi is a decent slice and their 1 / 2 price sushi includes rolls , too !
asian	buyer beware : you don 't get what you paid for with these outrageous prices ... the broth was very salty and their was barley any noodles in my bowl ... 12 $ for what ? your basically paying for their netflix account because they show anime from a netflix account yaki ramen ? ? more like yucky ramen
asian	i ordered $ 50.00 worth of sushi from this restaurant the other day and when it did not arrive , the restaurant refused to issue a refund and deferred me to " just eat " to deal with the problem . they insisted it had arrived and would not help rectify the problem . " just eat " could not get them to refund the money and i was left having spent $ 50.00 and wasting over and hour of my time . there are plenty of sushi places in toronto that have excellent customer service . don 't waste your money here .
asian	i just ordered our dinner . jumbo shrimp , chicken balls , spareribs and fried rice . took forever to get to my place and i 'm 1 mile away . all the food was so overcooked i couldn 't eat it . i could hardly cut my shrimp it was so hard . the rice was so salty . the entire meal went in the garbage because that 's where it belongs . if you want good chinese food , order somewhere else ! ! !
asian	went there recently with a party of 3 ( ! ) and we were wondering why the price seemed a bit higher than expected . below at the bottom was a tip they conveniently added without telling us ! we were outraged because we were not informed and they would have happily accepted tip on tip ! be cautious ! !
asian	the selection is somewhat limited compared to other ayce sushi places in mississauga . the unagi sushi was unusually fishy and strange tasting which was a really big turn off since i love eel . it really didn 't feel or taste that fresh and i was honestly worried but no ill side effects the day after so i guess that 's alright . service is alright . they 're not overly warm or welcoming but i didn 't expect much . they are relatively quick though . overall , i wouldn 't come here again . it 's one of those kinds of places where you just go to eat to get full , not necessarily for quality food .
asian	i wish i were joking . i ordered the usual , chicken with vegetables . it was taking a long time so i peeked back behind the window . the " cook , " if you want to call him that , was just goofin off. then he casually starts to throw everything in the pan . it was awful . undercooked everything. tough to chew. obviously , it is a health hazard to undercook chicken. the bathrooms were disgusting too . stay away from this dump .
asian	i called to find out if they had available a special kind of meat which the lady said they did . i told her that i was on my way to get some . it took me 20 mins to get there and she told me that she was sorry but she took an order and sold everything to another customer who apparently had still not picked up the order ! i was very disappointed with the service i would never go there again ! ! ! '
asian	they barely keep their food supplied and the worse of all , i found a piece of hair , yes i said it a hair ! i found a piece of hair in the self served ice cream station . that station is so unprotected that i 'm not surprised a piece of hair fell in . but just the thought of another random stranger 's hair in there is just plain nasty ! ! ! i even tried to talk to the manager but it took literally 15mins . before the manager came .
asian	i honestly wish i could give this place 0 / 5 stars but the food was mediocre , def not as good as other reviews state . i wish i would have learned my less n the first time and not have returned for a second visit . the table behind us is having the same problem . ah , please don 't come here , go to kaya
asian	the tiger roll had a gritty feel when i ate it , there was no real flavor in any of the rolls . i was highly disappointed in this place .
asian	actually we could not eat it because of the rawness of the meat . lemon chicken was raw and the teriyaki chicken wasn 't even chicken . both dishes smelled bad as well . we maybe had a half a bite of each dish and told them we couldn 't eat it . still charged us for the meals . we 'll never go to this place again . gross !
asian	we noticed it was empty for a sunday night dinner time . we shouldve taken the hint . old salad drenched in dressing . noodles must have been cooked that morning because they were soggy and slimy . sushi is cheap in price and taste . and the yum yum sauce was not yum at all . just mayo . wasted money and time . the waitress didn 't bother to talk to the manager . everyone is oblivious to the embarrassment they call food . will never return .
asian	however , i had to wait for 45 minutes for a bowl of pho on 2 occasions ! it doesn 't seem like they have enough staff to accommodate the volume of traffic coming in ... i won 't be returning .
asian	there are at least 6 phoenix restaurants in a 2 mile radius and unfortunately we choose pho king this time . over salted , lukewarm , and overpriced are the three comments we both agreed on . my pho was served without noodles as well . i had to ask if that 's how they served it and they added cold noodles to the already lukewarm broth . even the garnish bar was sad . empty trays missing limes , basil , and jalapeños . the staff should spend more time taking care of customers , cleaning , and replenishing rather than gossiping and texting . we were truly disappointed and left still hungry .
asian	like are you serious , how is this place even still open ? ? waste of money and not to mention how soggy the noodles were and the orange chicken oh god horrible ! !
asian	but service sucks ! i have never been so embarrassed in my life . the owner would not serve my son on all you can eat because my husband was not done with his roll . she said he has to eat his dads first . we frequently eat dinner here . not again , she continued to argue after she had my cc in her hand after repeated attempts from me to say . ok ok just charge me so i can get out of here . the entire restaurant watching this shit show . good luck with your unclean , dirty restaurant . sad for the employees she runs around yelling at . # neveragain !
asian	ordered for 5 people we took a couple bites , almost puked , payed the 100 + $ tab and left immediately . do yourself the favour and don 't come here .
asian	by far the rudest staff and most unprofessional service. would never recommend this to a friend i wanted to keep .
asian	nothing is fresh or has taste ... will never come back !
asian	by far the worse noodle pla i 've ever been too ... i would of rather paid $ 20 for a cup o noodles .... save yourself , and walk away
asian	the one in henderson is way better ! don 't get me wrong they do have great sushi it 's just their service was terrible . i went here 3 times just to give it another chance but i am not going here anymore . they even forgot to bring out our drinks so that 's when i had the last of it . the only good thing i can say about this place is they have a variety of rolls to pick from and if you like all you can eat they have it !
asian	they were rude. never coming back here and dont recommend it .
asian	portion size was ridiculously small and the wait time between each food was excruciatingly long . my husband and i ordered 1 seafood platter which contained 4 shrimps , 6 mussels , 2 larger mussels , 2 abalone 2 clams came with veggies and we ordered udon on the sides and shrimp wontons .... the bill was 120 $ never ever going back . i wouldn 't be surprised if it closes in the next6 months
asian	first of all the staff is rude and inattentive . secondly they only bring half the order and come back to make the excuse that they lost the order sheet . ordered : crab wontons -- sweet like dessert all the rolls had frozen shrimp tempura fish on dynamite was sour . the fried banana was soggy and dripping from oil . overall - horrible food that 's extremely overpriced . i wouldn 't ever go again even if it was free . $ 22.99 + taxes ( weekday dinner )
asian	where to start ? first of all , i payed 16 dollars for my friend and i , which is decently cheap . however , i thought it was strange you pay first . then i understood as i was presented a 1 isle buffet that is very basic , and very sad . honestly , the only good item i had was the general tsaos . my egg roll tasted strange like tequila , my egg drop soup was an oily mess , the cheese wonton was a fried wonton wrap with nothing inside , and to top it off , the fruit had mold . my first experience eating in pittsburgh was a bad one . i will not be returning .
asian	the chicken didn 't even look natural .. it was in like balled up chucks and the oily water broth tasted only of onion . i took 1 bite and was done .
asian	lol but it was seriously bad . i ordered orange chicken with white rice , my go to when trying a new place , it was terrible , the worst i have ever had . the rice wasn 't fully cooked and was clearly old and the orange chicken lacked flavor , was cold and hard . it also tasted old . i normally don 't write reviews but it was so bad i felt obligated .
asian	by far the worst chinese food i have ever had do your self a favour and eat elswhere .. over priced and mediocre .. ate elsewhere after .
asian	the menu is a piece of paper that is a sheet , cut into 4 . only a few items on the menu , the place is dirty . when you walk in you will see behind the register , what a disaster , i can only imagine their kitchen . food had no taste and pricy . go down to china house at lakeshore and babbit road . lucky to get 1 star !
asian	very bland , under cooked . they used spaghetti noodles for their chow main . egg rolls were like rubber and flavourless .
asian	i should have guessed that by the lack of customers but i had ordered carry out and it was too late by that time . also the weather was bad so i thought that maybe that was the reason ther was nobody there . do not eat here ! ! !
asian	the food was tasteless and bland . the servers were rude . we ordered hainan chicken and the server did not tell us they were out of hainan chicken until all of our food had already been served . the server came over to inform us they were out of the hainan chicken and was not the least bit apologetic . will never return . we should have just waited in the 2 hour line for the buffet .
asian	lemon chicken was rubber basically fighting with every bite .. never seen roastduck burnt drinks tasted like chlorine ... first n last ! never again !
asian	i ordered $ 60 worth of food to be delivered to my house . after an hour wait the food finally got here freezing cold . when i called to let them know they told me there is no way there food is cold and had no care in the world . i will never order from this place again and i advise everyone else to stay away .
asian	never fails ! ! every time i go they are so rude ! ! they only talk to you if you speak tagalog . i 'm filipino but i don 't speak the language and they knew it so they treated me as if i didn 't exist . so irritating ! ! i 'd give them a zero if i could . food is too greasy and it smells like chemicals in there . wish they had more filipino stores in henderson because i will never go back to this one .
asian	i called by phone to order food and i said twice i couldn 't understand you and they hung up on me . i called back and the same person answered and continued to yell at me , now this whole time i was polite and understanding and just wanted some orange chicken ... never got my chicken .
asian	the girl proceeded to tell us that it would be a 30min but more likely an hour wait when there were two tables of four opened . i pointed that out that we would squeeze into one of the four tops and she said they were reserved . it was very apparent that we were not welcomed . they also seemed under staffed . i wanted to bring my small family to taste the food since i had come to this place before and enjoyed their food . needles to say we will never be coming back .
asian	kung pao chicken ? unseasoned chicken with undercooked vegetables and red glop ... lakewood is known for it 's good restaurants , this is not one of them . it almost seems like they were trying to make it mediocre . i can 't imagine this place will be around much longer with this kind of quality .
asian	- expensive . you can get much better korean food in markham with prob 20 % less the price here . - poor service . you ring the bell three times , wave everywhere and no one seems to ( or pretend not to ) have noticed you . i wish i could give this place a zero star , that 's how bad this place is . if you are not asian and just wanted to go to a " so-called " korean restaurant and get ripped off then def go for it .
asian	this place is anything but authentic . i have been sick since i ate it . pad thai is traditionally made gluten free if its authentic , after four of five bites i could tell their pad thai was not authentic ( god knows what was in it ) and i am suffering the effects of eating it a few days later . i am allergic to wheat and never have had an issue as i always order pad thai it 's a safe go to dish . maybe there other dishes are decent but man this pad thai was just awful . i wont be back , there are much more authentic and better thai places in scottsdale .
asian	they stated itd be 5 min for the chow mein and 5 additional for the orange chicken . the cook looked like he just chuckled and walked in the back . i had questioned to myself why the gentleman before us seemed so angry and left and now i know why . we walked out behind him .
asian	by far the worst panda i 've ever been to. it 's close to the house and typically i 've had great experiences w / pandas but every time i go here i 'm left unhappy. they literally gave me four pieces of chicken .
asian	i have been a customer here for 12 years and it 's sad to say i will never go back . what a shame . the good food does not do the service justice .
asian	not only did we ask for rice 3 times ... it never came . water wasn 't filled once . two ladies working and four tables seated . this place can sucks . i don 't understand how you forget when someone 's asks 3 times for a spacific item . water ? cmon that 's automatic . i don 't care what excuse you have , that should never be forgotten . last time i eat here . i don 't recommend anyone eating here . we had to ask for our check 2 times and only when the next shift came we got our check . go to honey pig . that place is better . better food and service at honey pig .
asian	no matter where you go sushi taste similar , but this place really out did itself to be # 1 on my never going back to place . i haven 't eaten anything all day . for any type of food to not satisfy you when you are starving must say something . they use take out menus for their dine-in . service was horrible . i came in to eat by myself and had to sit there with no one to drop off my check after 10 minutes finishing my meal . the only positive thing i can say is the shrimp vegetable dumplings .
asian	they make it out of sight , which is a bad sign , and it tasted like it was a day or two old . not saying it was , just saying it was not very good . the meat we ordered was sub par , not horrible but not good . the salad literally tasted like they used cleaning agents as a dressing . salad is always a favorite when going to a sushi place but this one was downright terrible . on top of all that it was not cheap . would not recommend . they had good soda . nice people , but the place sucked . i 'm rating it honestly .
asian	we ended up throwing out our whole dinner as it was a to-go and didn 't find out until we got home ... and like the other reviewer said , i never throw out food either !
asian	i would like to give them a one star and i don 't think i 'd like to give them another chance . friendly service but speed of sushi delivery is horrible . this place seems to be busy and it 's bring your own alcohol . students also get a discount . if you truly love sushi , you will know this is not the place by pure observation and presentation . the taste speaks for itself and the rice isn 't sticky enough and falls apart . if you check my other posts , you will know where my favorite sushi place in montreal is .
asian	the ingredients are alright .. nothing outstanding .. the seaweed wrapper is hard to chew i like the idea of each customer gets to choose its sushi roll ingredient .. from wrapper , rice , protein , sauce , and toppings .. but i am disappointed at the quality of sushi this place delivers
asian	i have been there 3 times , to be fair and give it a chance to change my mind . each time the sushi has been dull , flavorless , and completely over priced . the service is so-so , and the menu would be impressive it the sushi had any quality to it at all . i have eaten many types of good sushi and have never been so disappointed by the quality of food . for $ 14.00 i expect far more than some stale crab , limp rice , and over salted dipping sauce . unfortunately , there are far better sushi places in town , such as stingray and kobe tepan . don 't waste your time or money on sushi 101
asian	i was surprised that the tea wasn 't fresh , the food was pricey and not worth it in terms of freshness .
asian	my dad had the pad thai which was closer to italian spaghetti than any thai dish . when the server came back to take our bill he never asked how our food was even when noticing i had only taken one bite. when i politely tried to give him some feedback on the dish he said " it shouldn 't have tasted bad " then walked away and brought back the bill . no apology or offering to bring me something else . wont be back !
asian	i don 't think this place can last much longer .
asian	came in ordered and everything was ready in ten minutes . the food tasted recooked , old , mircowaved . not worth what i paid . will never come here again ! ! totally gross . panda express is better and that 's saying something because they have crappy food too .
asian	it 's sad to say that br ause i 've been to about 5 others and this arizona location one just wasn 't up to par . the waiter was not very knowledgeable on the menu and when filling our water glasses he spilled it on the floor in front of our table and left it . the food was also not good . the portions in comparison to the california locations were relatively smaller . the new chang 's lobster fried rice was bad . the seafood in it tasted spoiled . rather than make a scene , i paid for my food and decided to just write a review .
asian	just a quick break down of what we ordered : i had the sesame beef and shrimp eggs rolls and my girlfriend had the crab rangoon and crispy shrimp with broccoli . sesame beef = really chewy beef with too much thick sauce shrimp egg roll = average / what expected crab rangoon = bad / really chew crispy shrimp = i got an ' ok ' from the girl due the amount of different places like this in the area , i would try another and not order from here again . i guess i should have see this coming when i noticed that they also sell lotto tickets in addition to asian food .
asian	i used to think highly of this restaurant , but in a recent visit with my family i was very disappointed . after placing my arms on the table i felt them stick and that 's when i tried to wipe them down and discovered both tables were extremely filthy ( moist wipes were charcoal black after i was done ) . the waiter apologized and said that the ink from the menu causes that , but menus are kept inside a plastic pouch , so it must be magic ink . i 'm definitely not coming back , as i don 't want to begin to imagine what the kitchen looks like .
asian	the girl at the register had to have an iq of a doorknob . i phoned in an order one time and when i got there , i paid and sat down . i waited 20 minutes before the doorknob realized my food had been ready since i got there . and when i asked why she didn 't tell me , she just looked at the cook , who had about the same iq , and they both shrugged . that 's what you get when you hire a bunch of middle school dropouts . who cares if the food was even good , this place sucks ...
asian	when you walk up to a food station , you don 't know what 's there and their prices . you get much authentic chinese food on spring mountain . i will not come back again !
asian	i should have known better because we walked in for the lunch rush and there were only 2 other tables of people . we thought we 'd at least get in and out of there quick , but no , we were there for 90 + minutes . the water with cucumber slices in it is gross . my nephew had the yakisoba , and he said the yakisoba at the chow hall in the marines was better . 2 of us had ramen and it was bad . the pork just smelled and tasted expired . the wait staff were inexperienced but tried really hard . i think they know how bad the food is and feel bad .
asian	place fells like its falling apart ...... yes , nothing charming about an old building with a loose flooring .... cracking and squeaking .... again .... caca ......... oh yah ..... the pho ga ..... chicken bouillon cubes .... thank you .
asian	it 's a great place for ryerson students to hang out , although the food is definitely inconsistent - sometimes very greasy or very spicy , even when you choose the same chili / heat rating .
asian	i asked if the beef is fatty / oily , she said it 's rare beef . hmmm , i knew that , i ordered rare beef pho . i kept repeating , she kept saying it 's rare . she should be honest and said it is fatty . worst rare beef pho ever ! i regretted spending over $ 8 on pile of rice noodle , some fatty low quality beef , and greasy soup . i only ate a little bit , couldn 't eat anymore . it 's that bad people ! save your money and go somewhere else .
asian	sahara rainbow roll - 7 / 10 edamame - 8 / 10 . nothing special but good
asian	it took them about 45 mins to serve our food . they need more servers or maybe hire servers with brains . the food was almost soggy , so obviously they 're just been sitting there instead of serving it right away . the server kept going to the kitchen , but she only grabs the menus and bringing drinks over . they almost brought our food to the wrong table , if it weren 't for us to saying that the food was ours then we would probably wait another 45 mins . oh but it took them 5 seconds to give us our check . i almost walked out for waiting so long .
asian	the fish oil had no flavor . the grilled pork wasn 't seasoned like it should and the vermicelli not good .
asian	also ordered yaki udon , the worst udon noodles i 've ever had ! ! they were completely mushy and the vegetables had an acrid taste . told the waiter immediately to take it away that i did not like it--still charged me full price ! ! ! they get 2 stars for sushi , i do not recommend .
asian	i wouldn 't go as far to call it thai food but i guess whatever floats your boat ... its acceptable if you are just looking for something quick and easy , depending on when you come the food may or may not be as fresh ... who knows how long it has been sitting ...
asian	and if it 's friday night . come early or don 't even bother . food takes forever to arrive . so waiting around for a seat could take 2 hours at least . we waited well over 40 minutes after ordering and the waitress forgot our order , she came back to " confirm our order . " it took at least an hour for our food to arrive . people around us who ordered after us received their food first . they spoke korean , we didn 't , coincidence ? i think not . chicken is good . but not worth the wait . have a snack before coming .
asian	the hours stated 9 am to 830 pm but when we showed up at 1030 it was empty and the owner came out of the kitchen stating the chef was not there and they did not know when the chef would come maybe in one hour or two if we wanted to wait . we left hungry and did appointed
asian	when we got home only had half the order and now they won 't answer the phone to get a darn refund
asian	they lied and said called my phone and rom number . waited an hour just for them to lie about calling and say nothing was on the way .
asian	( their website listed business hour is 11 : 30am - 11pm . ) what is the point you listed business phone number on official website and yelp , but you don 't pick it up ! obviously , they don 't care about their business ! soooo disappointed ! stay away ! don 't wast your time !
asian	arrived at 1245pm and still had to wait 30 mins while they made it .
asian	omg ! i 'm still sitting her 45 minutes in , they have you pay as soon as you walk in to hold you here . the food is okay but not worth spending all day waiting for something i could 've ordered next door . they ignore the large parties who want to pack food up . never again !
asian	that 's the reason you order take out is so you don 't have to wait . had to reorder and now i am waiting on my food ... don 't know how it will taste but if they blow my mind i may upgrade this rating to 3 ... not really a good business .
asian	arrived at 7 : 40pm and they tried to deny us service saying they were closed . it was nearly 1.5 hours prior to closing time . extremely slow service . long wair time between items . extremely small portions . cut sashimi too small - little cubes . ayce selection is pretty standard . sushi was tasty , but not worth the wait . ordered items that were never made . told us to re order them . probably was hoping we didn 't notice . terrible ordering system using scrap pieces of receipt paper . strong paint or lacquer odour in restaurant . won 't return .
asian	closes at 11 . they said no problem , get here by 10 . we arrived 9 : 59 , and we were turned away ! we were a party of four . don 't want my business ? not ever getting it now ! not very nice . forever off my list .
asian	called ahead for pickup and she said 10 minutes so i arrivedd in 15 mins and yet had to wait for 20 mins to get my gross food
asian	they said that if we could show up around 12 noon we can get a table . so we showed up around 12 noon and it turns out that the only table that could accommodate us was reserved .
asian	" didn 't mind waiting so i said that 's fine and then i hear " ugh ok . " do you not want business ? damn .
asian	called and asked if they were still open at 10pm ... they said last seating was at 11pm so told them we will be there asap ... got there at 1040pm and walked in ... they all gave us the death stare and told us they already finished last call ... lol ... i work in this industry , how are you going to lie and say such shit when even the posted sign says last seating is ar 11pm and last call is after that ? lame .
asian	she told us that it wasn 't there and then shoved a ticket at us to wait in line ! she didn 't even apologize and then expected us to wait an hour for their mistake . we were good customers but will never return to this place again ! they need to fix their attitudes and learn how to provide good customer service !
asian	i arrived almost 10 minutes later , expecting to wait a little longer . i sat in the front for 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged i was there . food came out shortly after , and i paid about $ 2 more than what i was quoted over the phone . food was good , but the " shareable " portion size was small .
asian	well she still fucked it up and instead they made us some type of spicy tuna crunch roll . i like this place but the staff is terrible . not the first time i 've had stuff like this happen here . and now to the management , i would make those employees take the menu home and study it until they get their shit right . it 's embarrassing that me as a customer has to explain to the person who works there what 's on your menu . they just lost a loyal customer for life .
asian	was told told it would be ready in 15 minutes . i arrived 10 mins after i called and waited 20 more mins . people came in after me were seated and got there food . when i finally received my food and took it home it was cold . never going here again . and not to mention the fried wonton was fried so hard i could barely eat and . and nothing was inside of them .
asian	the host told us they did not accept reservations . when we arrived , four different ( and some larger ) parties that arrived after us were sat before us . we waited 40 minutes and ended up leaving without eating .
asian	i then called back and it was busy as the woman still hadn 't got back to the phone to even realize i had hung up . nice way to treat your customers .
asian	have previously ordered before several times . i will take my business elsewhere
asian	the answer was 9 : 00pm . we arrive at 6 : 45pm and they are closed . sign on restaurant was crossed out and said closed at 7 : 00pm . last call for food was before 6 : 45pm . absolutely stellar customer service !
asian	" i asked what time they close , 8pm , but they don 't want to make more dough . they had a big order at 5 : 30pm and they can 't take anymore orders . really ? buddyz will not last long in tukee with that service . i hope it 's due to ironing out the kinks !
asian	called at 7pm , they are open till 11pm , i was told they are not delivering , i live a 20 minute walk away from this store , the weather is clear , i called the last 2 days and the same thing at different times , they have a track record of closing early , and not delivering past 8 pm , back when i ordered more regulry , i don 't recommend this place unless you are desperate !
asian	hours on friday say they are open until 10pm ! i swear his place just sucks ! ! no customer service whatsoever ! ! i wish there was another pho place close to home ugh ! ! ! jenny pho why you gotta be so far ? !
asian	i was informed they wouldn 't take my order even though they don 't close til 10pm . welcome to bad employed , bad customer service and poor attitudes . doesn 't surprise me . but they 've lost my business . i hope others don 't patronage business with poor service
asian	called because of burnt mushrooms and they said that 's how they cook them disgusting never again
asian	i cannot understand people who go into business to service people , and they ignore the customer . this is very lazy service . big disappointment
asian	the guy on the other end even asked how to spell my name and last name . only to find out that they didn 't have me on the reservation list . what a bummer . i was really looking forward to eating here . what a disappointment especially when you are eating for two .
asian	the lady taking my phone order was nice but didn 't tell me my wait time so i had to call back . wait time was 1 hour and 30 minutes for delivery ! ! our food took that long to come . also , they don 't come up to the rooms , you have to meet them downstairs . the guy delivering our food wasn 't wearing a uniform , it was just a regular guy . the food was spilling in our bag , my noodles were clumped together , and the chicken had no sauce or anything ( when it was supposed to be honey flavored ) . never order from this place for delivery ! horrible .
asian	called for delivery ... didn 't even get a hello and was instantly put on hold ... when i asked for a delivery order the man on the phone was very abrupt and rude ... they say quick delivery on their add but told me it would be an hour for a small pizza and a salad ... i don 't care how good the food is / might be .... first impression was terrible .... i thought we had better customer service than this in canada .
asian	asked to speak to manager ( i think his name was alex ) who said i could get take out or call grub hub . i am 6.4 miles away .
asian	quick delivery but every package was either leaking or broken . sauce all over the bag and contents spilling everywhere . in addition the food was bland - even for chinese delivery .
asian	asked for large fried rice , returned home to see small fried rice . when called them , they say it was their mistake and we could return to get a larger size ... who would travel back 7miles in 108deg summer afternoon ? asked them to make my dish spicy and they charge $ 0.50 to add chilli oil into it ? i am like hell with you guys ! they are just money makers ... portion size not good , quality just okay .. i would say , try another place and skip this one .
asian	still had to wait 30 mins for the food to be ready . went to the cash to double check my order , since staff were just talking around and on the phone . turns out , my food has just been sitting there . service is really slow as staff are just seen talking and standing around . i would never dine it in this place . since the wait time is very extensive due to poor service .
asian	was on hold for 3 minutes before calling back . was told that order would be ready in 15-20 . drove there . guess what . not only was my order not done . i 'm still waiting for order . person at counter keeps telling me order will be up soon . any way . 10 minutes and counting later .... still waiting for takeout order . thank goodness i 'm not in a rush today . i hope the food is good .
asian	both sucked . i could feel the crunch of msg on both . bbq pork had no flavor ( zero ) . house special fried rice was nothing but normal fried rice with chicken and shrimp . nothing great about the ambience . go only if you are craving for low grade asian food .
asian	then she hung up on me without as much as a goodbye . wow ... no effort to satisfy a customer at all .
asian	it is now 2 : 25 and still no show . they cannot tell me when someone will be there . they should not be taking appointments that they cannot make . my entire day was wasted waiting on them .
asian	i call and they said that they have a reservation for 8 : 00pm , get there at 8 : 20 pm and amazingly we are too late for our reservation ? we have a party of 9 people and i would expect a little leeway for 20 minutes . we ended up going to another place down scottsdale road ( saporro ) and they were able to seat us and our total bill was like $ 1200.00 + a 20 % tip so sumo maya missed out but maybe have better service next time .
asian	the lady was extremely rude , inattentive and impatient . not to mention the fact that she was coughing up a lung in my ear - every other word . she talked over me as i tried to tell her about my allergy and seemed to be in a rush . i cancelled my order due to the horrible service . can 't review the food so 2 stars for the one star service . enjoy !
asian	ok . at the 30 minute mark i asked they said ten more , at the 55 minute mark they came out and said the lost my order . i guess i will never know if the food is good i walked out
asian	manager , is making all types of excuses to cover up why he didn 't follow instructions from customer it was me . then a delivery driver older guy white hair adds inappropriate remarks towards how i should order next time . wingz make you sick from this place . if you want food poisoning go ahead and eat from this place ........ first of all your a 60 year old delivery driver thats all you have dude good luck chuck .
asian	after waiting over and hour i called back and they assured me it would be no longer than twenty minutes . nearly another 40mins later i finally cancelled my order . i understand you are busy but this is such a terrible representation of your business and it 's customer service capabilities . if you are too busy to fulfill the demands of your clientele , simply admit it up front and certainly don 't try to backpedal to make a few extra dollars . i will never try and order from here again .... delivery orders beware ! if i could 've given no stars ... i would 've ...
asian	when i arrived , the employees thought i couldn 't understand chinese and started making rude comments . pho was okay .
asian	that 's a minus one star to begin with . another two stars are deducted from their taste isn 't even authentic and tasty . i 've been to many banh mi sandwich places and this one doesn 't even compare to the ones i usually go to based on price . this place is also overpriced which is why i gave it two stars . the grilled pork and beef was very dry and bland . the special sandwich didn 't taste good either . overall very disappointing .
asian	pucked up my food . got home only to find i had shrimp fried rice . im allergic to shrimp . didnt go back , didnt call but i will not order from them again
asian	went in 30 minutes later . lady at counter placed order after i got there - when i told her that i called 30 minutes before , she said that it was the boss who picked up the phone so she couldn 't say anything to her . and then she gave me stank face . good think sam woo isn 't an airline and this lady wasn 't the co-pilot . made me late for work . this place is a joke - heed the warnings . oh , ps , the food stinks . literally . when i got to work , everyone was like " what 's that smell ? "
asian	the employee advised that my order would be ready in 15 minutes . i showed up about 10 minutes later , paid , and waited an additional 20 minutes . a total of 15 minutes extra than what i was advised . food is ok , not great .
asian	driver arrived with my order and became frustrated when i was getting my money out of my pocket to pay him . he told me that he had other customers to get to and he couldn 't waste his time waiting for me . no customer service skills at all . the food was just as bad as his attitude !
asian	my wife gets there the lady tells my wife no order was there . turns out they have new employees and they did not know how to make a half and half so my wife was upset and left . i called the lady she told me about the new employees issue and there was no order . i gave them my phone number twice they could have called me . never had this issue anywhere else . maybe train your employees before hand .
asian	i get there and no order one hr later still no order they gave my order to someone else . do they say sorry no to they offer me anything why i am waiting no . every time we order to go we have a issue . i guess this will be my last time as they do have good food . just a same they do not care
asian	first the girl had no idea and asked the other staff and after discussing she said 10 : 30pm . we made it before 10 : 30pm after a 30 minute commute and the waitress said the chef had already left . they were not apologetic at all and just said well there 's no chef to make the food for you . was definitely a disappointment since it use to be my late night sushi spot .
asian	when i arrived they reserved 2 tables that are not side by side ! servers would just ignore you . need to get their attention several times just to ask for water and utensils . service is really bad . i even need to stand and walk over the front just to request something . food wise is normal like all the congee chinese food restaurant . will avoid this place for big gatherings from now on ... too stressful
asian	rolls are mostly lettuce and bean sprouts . hardly any meat in my soup , it 's ridiculous . they only offer 3 meats in the combination pho so it could be filled more . i 'm not one to complain but i feel ripped off . portion super small for 9 $ .
asian	the lady who answered the phone was not willing to help and was rushing . i have never eaten here and was really excited to try . i called in to place order to go and i asked which flavor was most well known or popular but the lady told me to just come in and try sample . she also told me that the to go orders don 't go in until i pay for it at the store ( then what is the purpose of to-go ) .
asian	they said it would take 1 hour . we arrive and nothing is ready . they say wait another 30mins ! not a great first impression . the spanish at the checkout desk woman wasnt really any help . it 's really disorganized , not happy and probably will never go back . food takes way too long to make . i think they are understaffed . the blurry ninja on their shop banner gives you a tip on how much attention to detail they give .
asian	got there and paid . waited half hour and no food . come to find out my food was just sitting there and no one bothered to tell me my order was ready tho both employees saw me sitting there waiting . got home and they forgot my rice and of course my food was cold . i ordered pad thai with beef and there was both beef and chicken in it . not a good experience !
asian	it 's now 7 : 30 , and we are still sitting in lobby waiting for our order . food is decent here , not great . but service is horrible . needs new management .
asian	called in to ask for hours and they said something i couldn 't hear so i asked politely for them to repeat and they hung up on me ... really ? what kinda of customer service is that .
asian	they would not deliver to us because we are located on the west side of the street and not the east side . very disappointed and will take my business somewhere else .
asian	we were told our small order would take 50 minutes ... huh ? that 's awhile ! then learned it would take 80 minutes . 80 minutes for take out ! sorry . there is better food elsewhere .
asian	called in to order about 5 times before. when arriving there they never have it ready. whats the point of taking orders on the phone ? they always ask what did you order and then goes to the back to make the food even though you made the order on the phone 30 mins ago ... terrible terrible terrible ... they should shut this place down. terrible service .
asian	girl was rude . they forgot part of order . then when called back they said i could come pick up the stuff forgotten . not even an apology . don 't go here unless you want poor service .
asian	got there and it wasn 't ready and so i wanted to pay and do some grocery shopping first . then i saw $ 42 ! and asked how many lbs and the waitresses didn 't know . just shrugged . stupid me paid and got this when i got back from no frills . it 's crispy and tasty but $ 42 ? ! mother warned me not to go . always listen to your mother . lack of communication and i just got legally robbed .
asian	i told him i wanted to order takeout and the guy told me the kitchen was closed , i then asked why the kitchen is already closed when the store is suppose to close at 11 : 00pm and the guy said " well it 's just closed " and hung up on me . let 's not talk about the food , but the service is definitely unacceptable .
asian	the food was cold and not to mention they are only 5 minutes down the road will not order again and i plan on calling the boss
asian	the lady who answered the phone questioned me why i want to place the order now . she told me it 's better to call saturday morning . and i was like , why can 't i order now since i 'm already on the phone with you ! ? ! ? they just lost a customer since i was going to order more food for them for friday night but the service received was so poor ! ! ! i don 't understand her logic ! !
asian	called me to say they were out of boba so they could not fill my order , so i told them to cancel but my card was still charged !
asian	everything was marked up really high , grapefruit soju is normally $ 16.99 anywhere else but it was $ 19.99 . food was very mediocre , and can 't be justified for the mark up .
asian	no one answered . decided to walk in about 30 minutes after opening . wasn 't packed at all . i work in the serving industry so i know how it works . younger people don 't usually tip but little do they know that we tip well . they told us they couldn 't sit us because we didn 't have a reservation and didn 't have room for 7 . we were treated like kids and they were very rude . not very accomadating . will not be back considering it would have been our first time there .
asian	called on for the szechuan sauce they said they had it ... i drove 15 min to get the sauce and the guy said they didn 't have it .... learn your shit
asian	arrived there ( literally ) 2 minutes after the phone call , checked in and the same guy said it was an hour wait . basically told us false info on the phone to persuade us to go . disappointed .
asian	had to keep asking someone if they could deliver etc . when they found out i was not calling from a residence they informed me that they couldn 't deliver . i found that strange since the website said that they delivered to beachwood . customer service doesn 't seem to be important to these folks .
asian	called them 5 times said they were open till ten no answer give my business to someone else
asian	how do they take orders ? yelp says they deliver ...
asian	we arrived around 828pm for pickup and they said they were closed . great , we drove all the way over here for nothing ! guess we will be sticking to ono .
asian	the operator did not speak english and decided he was just going to hang up on me .
asian	came to dine at 9 : 30p.m on a thursday night and the server told us they were closed , even though moments earlier i was told they were open late and their door even said 11 : 00p.m. management should do something about their lazy staff which is evident from other reviews . also , they only take cash on their lunch special which we all know what happens with that money next .
asian	the guy who answered said he was too busy to take orders , and i was told to order through their website . i told him that i couldn 't order through the website because i was driving . he suggested to call back later . i have never called a place to order take-out and was told to call back later . if they can 't handle taking orders through the telephone , i could only imagine how they handle making the food . this is poor business management , and this place does not deserve my money . don 't just take it from me ; there 's been a lot of negative reviews about this place .
asian	i said no and was going to ask if they were closing . before i could even ask i was told " goodbye ma 'am " and was hung up on . i understand somethings but not being told an explanation and hung up on is not the way to conduct business . period .
asian	whoever answered told me that they don 't accept pick up orders over the phone - that i should just come in or call alce . who doesn 't accept pick up orders over the phone ? ! on top of that , the alce menu doesn 't include the option for lechon kawali or escaveche .
asian	i got there at 9pm server said 10-15 more minutes . i wait 30mins passes and she goes couple more minutes . at 9 : 50 i ask her what 's going on she goes let me go back there and check ... comes out 5 mins later and tells me oh he 's having issues with the oven i 'm not sure how much longer it will be . 9 : 55 i 'm at mcdonalds writing this review . yup i 'm pretty much not coming back . tip : ask them if their oven works before you order . zero stars if i could coz i really didn 't get anything from them zero !
asian	drove 20 minutes to go for dinner at sushi hour - only to find the restaurant closed . very annoying for a loyal customer . no way to contact management via email or to leave a message on the phone . as a result i ended up going to spoon or fork - it was awesome and i probably won 't be going back to sushi hour because of this .
asian	she had said they don 't do reservations and i 'm more than welcome to rent the catering room , then i asked how much and she directed me to another call wth ? really ? so had a big party of 22 brought them business and the waiters we 're rude , kept looking for their service . i wouldn 't go back here .
asian	" we came right now and were told there 's nowhere to sit . went home hungry , including my 2-year-old . they just sent us away ! highly recommended if you are ok not eating . um , what ? wtf avoid !
asian	groupon clearly shows value i paid never expires ! i will never dine at a place that defrauds their customers by selling groupons and refusing to accept them !
asian	she only answered with , " well what time did you order ? " terrible costumer service .
asian	disappointed and upset . they should of put a note on menu that they don 't do delivery at mississauga location , wasted my time to call . and last weekend i came to mississauga location , as on website it said they open till 2am but they already close at 12 . what kind of business is that ?
asian	took twice as long to deliver as they said it would . food was not even lukewarm . food was unrecognizable as traditional chinese food . noodles were oily and had no flavor , nor did any of the food for that matter . the food was not edible at all , very disappointing .
asian	hmmmm when you call and they answer and you say i would like to place an order for delivery i believe that means you want it delivered ... but since the young girl on the phone wasn 't paying attention i was told i didn 't order delivery and their response is after waiting 45 min is do you want it delivered or not .. then they arrive with cold food . love to be called a liar .. it 's a shame cuz i ate there all the time and spent a lot of money there ... they should have made fresh food a delivered it instead of calling me a liar and bringing cold food .. what a shame ! !
asian	the website was no help either just titles with no specifics ... they use to have great customer service but now that they have plenty of customers the customer service is out the window ! we need a new sushi roll in the 89129 area .
asian	restaurant is 2 miles away . very unprofessional , answered the phone gave them my address and told me they didn 't delivered on my area . just hung up before i could ask for pick up .
asian	45 min waiting time for pick up ? you have got to be kidding me . no reason why pick up should take this long . its not even that busy . i can cook the food faster myself . terrible .
asian	get a message that they can 't answer the phone because they are either helping another customer or its outside of business hours ( which it 's not ) . i can honestly say i 've never called a pizza place and got an answering machine . seriously ? made my decision easy . went to bashas instead .
asian	told me to try back tomorrow or come in and eat . i would have waited for the sushi but wasn 't given the option . not to mention they were horribly rude over the phone . i never have tried their food and now i definitely wont be .
asian	i asked if i had misunderstood their hours , and they made it sound like i was the one being unreasonable . inconsistency seems to be the theme with this place - i have stopped by multiple times during their " open hours " to see that they are just randomly closed with no message on their website and no message on their phone . these are all service issues . i will say that when i have ordered , the food quality was very good , fairly priced , and well-sized portions . however , these service problems may spell the end of my red orchid days .......
asian	we live east of ossington on harbord ... not far . the guy who answered had a dismissive tone , didn 't know where ossington was , and then after checking , asked for the address again before pronouncing us too far . meh . was looking forward to trying out the food and delivery service , but no thanks now .
asian	we got shrimp and broccoli was spicy , general chicken spicy as well . both came out pretty well . i asked if they had malgolian chicken and i was told that 's only for dinner . i will probably try a new chinese restaurant before i go back .
asian	called to place a take out order and was asked to please hold , 4 min later hung up tried to call back 3 times and got a busy signal , all three time. will not waist my time calling again , was told by friends they were good but i guess that will remain a secret
asian	they said they would . very disappointed they forgot to do this and didn 't even tell the guests till they were out the door . said they would credit the bill ? expected better .
asian	did some research and found multiple cases of people getting sick after eating here too .
asian	i brought some friends to come eat at this place because of how good it was before , but seeing how they are so un-open to the idea of new customers trying new things , it really bothered me as a regular customer . we didn 't ask for much , and we were very patient when they took their time to take our orders . overall , i 've never seen worse customer service in my life .
asian	portion size are pretty small . noodle was plain and very small portiin , more like a side dish .
asian	their soups are corn starch with no flavor . their fried chichen dishes are 90 % batter . their noodles resemble cheap spaghetti and their fried rice is flavorless and dry . avoid
asian	i ordered a bento box to try several meats ( pork , ribs , mahi ) for a quick takeout lunch . food took longer than expected to come out , and when i opened the box back at my desk , it was the wrong order . i had an overwhelming portion of chicken katsu . the chicken itself was fine , slightly dry but nicely crispy , tasty katsu sauce . but the mac salad was drowning in mayo , the rice was mushy , and oh yeah- it 's totally not what i ordered . didn 't finish the portion , tossed the leftovers . i was one of two customers , not sure how the single front of house employee got so confused .
asian	tip : bring listerine 2 you need to get out of the sun ( for the air conditioner ) to see a kid waiter in sandals drive 20 mins to pho # 1
asian	went there on monday " all-you-can eat . " not worth it . 1st - not all sushi in the menu can be ordered . 2nd , the waitress told us there was a 1 hr time limit ! ! ! there was only one sushi chef . we had to wait for our order as there were more people . not worth your money . beware ! ! !
asian	all ingredients are clearly not fresh which is a necessity for my sushi enjoyment . skip this one .
asian	that being said , welcome to how do you roll . i got to give it to the founders of this place for coming up with a sushi spin to the fast casual market . they are also smart to offer a " happy hour " where rolls are on discounted pricing . if you 're looking for sushi somewhere between the quality of a grocery store and a nice restaurant give this place a shot . maybe you 'll like it ?
asian	many years ago we had a standing lunch meeting there and i finally refused to eat there anymore . a couple of days ago we went to takara about 1 : 15 for lunch . the restaurant was empty and the decor had never changed . a tired looking environment . i ordered rolls and my partner ordered a bowl . both of our meals were tasteless . the service was unfriendly . they turned out the lights rather than politely reminding us that they were closing . i was surprised to see so many positive reviews . maybe it 's me .
asian	phö broth is supposed to have undertones of nutmeg , but this place kills whatever flavor their soup base has with mass amounts black pepper . great ambience , not so great soup . been back once , probably won 't again .
asian	first , some positives , like good bulgogi ( not too salty and not too mistery meat ) and the calbi , very tender and savory . here come the negatives : practically non-existent panchan - you would think that with such prices they would throw in some decent little plates ! the portion of meat on the platter is also small for the price . the beer is also expensive , i suppose this is a hollywood transplant. bottomline , good-looking place to hangout , but frankly you could get better somewhere else . also , keep in mind that ayce usually means all-you-can-eat-low-quality .
asian	call papa johns at 9 : 50 to use my 50 percent off promo code that expires today february 15th the customer service representative to answer the phone nathan place my order for 2 large pizzas that was on special for $ 20 so my total should be $ 10 and he tells me then my total is $ 24.50 how is that when i have a 50 % off promo code he told me i couldn 't use both discount ? he never explained i had to pay regular price in order to us the promo code just over all very poor customer service need less to say i cancelled my order and went else where .
asian	we don 't take anymore pick up order , if u can make it before 10 then it 's fine . and halfway through ordering he said no more bbq meats . if you don 't want to cook anymore since you are closing just say so . last time i ever ordered here . shit why be complicated ? ?
asian	have been . frequent customer but will no longer be . will stick with ordering from orange fish in lorne park
asian	fried dark meat chicken cooked in a spicy sauce then reheated in a microwave in a styrofoam box was a little cold . while i was eating my semi heated chicken and eyeing tangerine next door , maybe i should have went there for some real heat and spice ? halal friendly .. i still don 't get it about heating up food in a microwave in a styrofoam container ? ? a side note : while i was drinking my pineapple ginger nectar ( $ 1.95 ) , i just realized that if i finished the whole bottle of this juice , i would have consumed 280 calories and 62 g of sugar ... maybe that 's why i am on a sugar high now ?
asian	we come back ... and the food was ok , but the service was sooo terrible . we ordered them waited forever for just edamame and a house salad . the sushi then took another ten years . in the mean time , every server came up and asked if we needed anything and we repeatedly said the exact same rolls . it was extremely disappointing . the first time we came , it was extremely busy , but the food was good , as was the service . tonight , the restaurant is practically empty and it was a terrible experience .
asian	worst decision ever to eat chicken here . do not recommend & will not return . got malai chicken tikka which looked good and presentable but tasted god awfulchicken was super dry for being a dry chicken . also , was hard and dried looking on the outside . these guys need to learn how to cook . that 's horrible to be preparing food like this ! what a waste of money ! very disappointedsee my yelp pictures for evidence of dryness in the chicken .
asian	ordered a chicken biryani carryout order since dinner buffet was almost on the verge of completion . let me explain here - i am a food lover and can instantly say by the look of indian restaurants on what kind of food to expect . there are different versions of " authentic " indian cuisines floating around and i must say this is not one of them . biryani was sweet ( authentic biryani is never sweet ) with cashew and raisins . good luck with this place .
asian	egg rolls and spring rolls are average . ordered large pho with everything . came out pretty quick , the bowl is not large enough for my standard . they skimped on the meats and organs ... not happy . broth is decent . overall .... average .
asian	the owners children ran around screaming the whole time . no refills , no one checked on me , had to go and ask for the check myself .
asian	decor looks cool.there are crabs legs , cold mussels and salad at the buffet table at the back . food are so so . nothing extraordinary . the hi-light was the service . we asked more than 3 times to clear out the empty plates which are loaded on our table , we even spoke to the manager about it and still no one came to clean up . they said they were short staff , but on a busy saturday evening ? i doubt i will come back as ayce sushi restaurant are everywhere which i may better spend the $ 30pp . my stars are given for the crab legs and sesame ice cream .
asian	it 's 1105am and im still hete 1119am on a tuesday . what a waste of time , car millage and gas . big banner says " new owners " blah blah ... well you got to step up and do it right ! ! ! right now i see 3 customers sitting on curb twittering their thumbs waiting to spend hard earned money here . i 'm leavimg ... can 't waste my lunch time any more ... boo ! ! ! ! besides , if they did open right now how prepared for the day would the bbq be ? i dont want last second prep cold bbq .
asian	from reading other reviews the owner seems to have no problem talking back to customers when he doesnt agree with them , but seems to have no response for the reviews saying they close early with no warning to patrons ... hm ..... i get it , its a family business , you got kids , shit happens , but it doesnt take any effort to atleast put a sign up saying " sorry for the inconvenience we closed early . " or heres a better idea , change your business hours ! ! simply poor business management . would love to hear the owner try to excuse himself out of this one ..
asian	let me warn you ! garbage tasting food , garbage ass sushi .. and i 'm being nice right now ..... should have known , can 't expect authentic sushi in middle of the desert . shaking my head . stomach hurting so much now , about to throw up ! !
asian	despite the food being decent , we had a terrible time with the service . for starters , our food has been missed several times , and it took 30 minutes for the food to arrive . another thing is i found the sevice to be rude , we had never asked for the bill , but it was brought upon our table . by then it seemed they want to rush out even though the restaurant was not full . would not recommend .
asian	her food came in 5 minutes and i waited for the next 30 minutes thinking that it will come the next minute . finally went up to the counter where they have the debit machine and found out they forgot it . never got an apology from neither the waiter nor the person who billed me and adding insult to injury , they had an " eat our crap and get lost " attitude .
asian	came at 10 : 35 pm for food pick up , people were eating in restaurant and we requested owner to let us eat inside and he said no you can not eat inside with i mean come on men grow up .. we paid $ 60 for food and not allowing us to eat .
asian	seemingly not too busy . currently everyone already had their food . ordered 2 bowls of pho rare beef . waited for half an hour and still no signs of our pho bowls . this is not the first time this happened . we were patient most of the time . this time we just walked out . now writing this as we are driving to pho kim long . better wait time and better service . will never come back .
asian	parking lot completely empty besides employees . miso soup was cold , baked mussels were cold and made me gag . no bueno for $ 28 . instead of trying something new id rather go to my regular spots . sushi yama2 , umiya , or sushi tachi !
asian	came at 4 : 30 pm no one greeted me lady look and said they jus reopen i said well do you want us to wait she basically look at us like no that 's when i exit and never return
asian	was told that it would be a 15 minute wait for white meat chicken and that they were out of everything else . don 't go there if you actually want to eat .
asian	this place is pretty expensive . i loved that they had escargot and sashimi for lunch . the sushi and sashimi was fresh but the rest of the menu was ok . was severely disappointed that dessert was not included in lunch or dinner buffet as most places i 've been to at least have ice cream . every round our orders were missing items and after 3 small rounds , the waiter kept our ipad and we could not order anymore . we would 've inquired why but we were full anyways . not sure if i would come back again for lunch . maybe dinner will be better .
asian	can 't put my finger on it . the cook was delightful but i asked if they can not make it spicy and the employee said they are all set the way they are . not their fault but it is food and i can even modify a big mac .
asian	came back again for my delicious tonkotsu and guess what ? not delicious anymore. the soup was all oil. like almost to the point where its on the jelly side rather than liquid. time to find a new place to eat tonkotsu ramen because i don 't have a reason to come here anymore .
asian	at night time , there is led lights , i wasn 't too comfortable . then the noodle , i am never full after eating the bowl . i had to go get snack from the korean truck down the street . they still haven 't fixed the machine and it 's cash only . next time i will go back to my regular ramen place down the street with better flavour and portion .
asian	came back a second time and found it more fat and too much mayo ... not enough meat , and very greasy ...
asian	came back for bun bo hue , but the broth wasn 't as flavorful like the first time i had it .
asian	i think they got worse but people still cram this restaurant on sunday . they don 't have much staff so you 'll find yourself waving them down for more tea or even the bill . the owner is really nice to her customers , she always comes by asking how the dishes taste . but i have to lie that it tastes good .
asian	had the crab meat xiao long bao , which were just ok ( lots of soup inside ) , the pan fried buns were soggy inside and the meat was terrible . shanghai noodles were just ok as well , i like the soy to be a bit more complex and flavourful , and then drunken chicken was pricey as they remove the bone but it 's mostly drizzled with alcohol sauce and not nicely marinated ( plus sliced too thin to enjoy the fatty chicken skins ) . overall a disappointing meal , even my parents said they wouldn 't come back .
asian	my noodles just swimming in an ocean of oil ........ a dish of oiliness with hardly any taste ...... definitely not malaysian style ... i wiped my oil mouth and i don 't think i will be back .
asian	ordered take out . as i was waiting , the sushi chef prepared another customer 's order and not once , but twice , ate some of the fish out of his fingers and then proceeded to continue preparing the sushi without washing his hands . spicy salmon maki with a side of saliva . gross . definitely not coming back now .
asian	15 min later we 've been told by 3 different ppl that " it would take just a second . " no " hi " or any kind of mention to how long it would take to get us a table. other clients also left because they were waiting for too long . too bad . we 've been here 2 other times and had a blast . food was great , but this time it seems like they did not have enough people working to take care of all the clients . i don 't know if we will come back soon anymore . very disappointed
asian	the bean sprouts were not a crunchy white but dirty and old as though they had been in a bag in the fridge for 2 weeks ... it was almost embarrassing . bean sprouts are insanely cheap , change that out , boss . the leaves of the basil were turning dark in many spots and even the onion that was already in the soup when it arrived wasn 't fresh . even with a groupon i won 't be coming back ... embarrassing to bring out a plate of old vegetables . no more soup for me .
asian	cooked food is drown in teriyaki sauce , so sweet and salty ! can 't even eat ! i usually finish all my food , but i just couldn 't ! sushi is nothing special . the broth for noodles has changed to tasteless . at the end they told me that i have too much left over , they won 't charge me this time but next time they will . i just paid and left . first of all , how can you eat when the food is awful ? ! second , there won 't be a next time !
asian	long story short , all 5 of the items i ordered were bland and of the same poor , soggy consistentcy you find at panda express .. except with less flavor . the kung pao was not spicy at all and the honey walnut shrimp was a soggy disgrace for the price , sorry guys . the positive reviewers most certainly have not tasted really good chinese food .
asian	got the sticky rice because the waitress recommended it to me . but it was way too salty . after the third bite , there was a rock in the rice that almost cracked my teeth .. complete trash and not worth 11 bucks ! !
asian	there was only 2 other patrons . they closed at 9pm . we went to thai house just down the road . they were packed but found 2 seats for us without hesitation . food at thai house is always good , fresh and fast .
asian	there were 4-5 tables there and they refused to serve us . we asked what about togo orders and they said depends on what you want . so we opted to leave and they lost our business !
asian	portions are very small . when i say small i mean it seems it 's meant for kids . taste was mediocre ( had the white soul base ramen ) . only got 1 thin slice of pork shoulder . ordered the don ( ginger pork ) was dry and very salty . i will not go back again .
asian	the highlight was an abundance of parking along with an air conditioned seating area ... service by the staff was confusing at best , despite being dressed in all black with their name tags . ... one of the waitresses was named " drizzle " ( ... is that a joke ? ) the milk tea with pearls was best described as tea flavored water with pearls that were too soft ... there at least was a nice layer of froth on top of my drink ...
asian	satay beef instant noodles - satay beef was super garlicky - instant noodles and the soup were too salty ... hk milk tea was decent . ... my stomach didn 't feel too well after breakfast ... maybe they left the beef out for too long ?
asian	none of the food was that great just eh . had chicken lettuce wraps and the house chow mein . i 've had better chow mein from panda express . they didn 't skimp on the meat in the chow mein , but overall bland and just boring . service didn 't redeem anything . don 't go here .
asian	when on yelp is says it 's open for lunch . try to go there for dinner and it was closed. wtf man are you opened or closed . it 's closed permanently .
asian	the braised beef was dry and overcooked .... bummer the crispy pork belly was embarrassing as i think it was refried from yesterday and was super dry ... staff was ok . portions were generous . $ 30 / head after gratuity and tax for lunch ...
asian	there aren 't many seating areas and space is a little cramped so either go earlier to beat the lunch crowd or grab take-out . my order wasn 't bad but won 't be memorable either . i couldn 't say what was so " thai " about my butter chicken and also can 't say my butter chicken was very ... butter chicken . overall would probably not return .
asian	this place has changed a lot in the past years . it was so nice about 17 years ago with a flower shop in the back they even had some crafts . super clean . now it 's just a waste of a drive . a bit stale looking with high prices . better deal at nofrills for the same chicken . they also sell fried chicken that was sitting under heat lamps with no buyers . so i left with out buying nada .
asian	took note that it takes 20 minutes for them to get it out the kitchen to us . we ended up waiting for about 50 minutes with no sign of our food and our water was not refilled even though we had requested it 10 minutes ago . the table next to us that was seated after us and ordered later than us got all their food and then some even though we had ordered the same thing . horrendous service . never going back there again .
asian	the service was quick but the food lacked any flavour especially the their milk tea ! i expected this restaurant to have good milk tea as they do owe a bakery in the same plaza . given the choices of restaurants in this plaza , i would not be returning back here anytime soon .
asian	sushi quality was good , service and speed of food especially for an average one hour lunch break was awful .
asian	came during the lunch hour and no one was here. that should have been my clue. the teriyaki chicken was dry and hard on the edges. the chicken lo mein was super salty. the egg rolls tasted old. the only good thing about the place was the nice asian couple that worked there , very polite and caring ; however that doesn 't make up for their lack of culinary skills .
asian	came for an early dinner tried the shrimp , mussels , crab all using the captains boil special sauce also added corn and potatoes 3lb of seafood was good for 2 people it was really tasty while we were there and i enjoyed it after we left though , i had a lot of tummy issues and my dining out partner also didn 't feel great not sure if it 's the seasoning they use or added msg i know they got a conditional health pass so maybe that 's why ( i think 1 infraction was not keeping food cold enough so that could definitely make someone sick )
asian	service was painfully slow , especially since the restaurant was maybe 10 % full . food was a notch below average and the price was certainly not a value for the quality and portion size . $ 15 for a few spoonfulls of curry ? this isn 't nyc / sf , guys . i really wanted to like this place but you 're better off spending your time and money elsewhere .
asian	where do i start ! food was not fresh , it was leftovers from the previous night ! ! ! being an indian i know about my food ! most of the food was over cos there were a couple of other families ! they were not prepared and i would not recommend to any one ! ! ! !
asian	( over an hour ) didn 't help that it was colder inside the restaurant then outside in the middle of winter . no heaters provided . not impressed .
asian	the owner did not ask us how many and did not seat us , yet they seated the table behind us . selection was very limited , food quality was not the best . ladies pushing the carts were not nice and very ignorant . no one smiled one bit although we were very polite . everyone seemed pissed off and grouchy . will not come again .
asian	i 've had take out from here for lunch and it 's okay since i 'm in the area . but there is so much competition in the area that service definitely makes a difference . also , the server watched us pay with the machine , so awkward !
asian	service was ok since it is a self service shabu buffet and they are pretty busy cleaning up after everyone 's cooking mess i personally used a ton of plastic plates to grab food and there was never a pile of trash on my table . the only problem i had was that we were told they close at midnight and they did not notify us they close down cooked food and desert island around 9ish . i wasn 't happy because i wanted something but waited for later only to see everything empty .
asian	the food was too oily and spicy , even for someone like me who enjoys the heat . so spicy , i could barely taste the flavor of the food . very expensive , and the portions were so large , i felt like i was wasting food because i couldn 't finish it . even though the place was almost empty , the service was really slow , and it was hard to find the wait staff to get their attention .
asian	the food was okay , but pretty average and mediocre . the beef sashimi was disappointing . they were cut too thick , and had a cold , icey texture as if it just came out of the freezer . also , you had to verbally tell the staff your order , which was not very efficient . we had all you can eat , which turned out to be more than expected--about $ 35 per person ! ! ! quite pricey and definitely not worth it compared to other all you can eat sushi restaurants such as sushi legend . would not come back anytime soon .
asian	the hot and sour soup was barely spicy or sour , and had a strange gamey taste . thank god they had chili oil and vinegar on the table . the tea tasted like plastic . the crab puffs were decent . my husband got the beef fried rice and found a smushed gnat in his food . additionally , the rice didn 't seem to be actually fried . it was more like steamed rice with stuff in it . the chicken with honey ginger was ok . i liked the pickled ginger . overall , would not return here .
asian	i 'm mortified and server asked if i want another one ? i said from the same kitchen ? no ! got up to leave and cashier told me i owe $ 20 , i said why am i paying for food i didn 't eat ? there 's bug in my food ! ! ! don 't go ! health warning ! ! ! !
asian	there are no sushi rolls on their happy hour menu . wtf ? ended up ordering the calamari , shrimp shumai , spicy tuna roll and honolulu roll . everything was mediocre . the best shrimp shumai ever is at stingray sushi . the one at hayashi just didn 't compare . the sushi rolls had some sort of crunch to them . it was probably the fake crab stick they put in there . or it might have been frozen on the inside .... whatever it was ... wasn 't appetizing . also , even though it was happy hour , it was still expensive . they also spelled edamame wrong on their menu . i guess that 's what you can expect from goodyear .
asian	also they gave me cold tempura sauce which kind of ruined my appetite .
asian	the spicy flavor on the soup was good and tofu in the soup was also cooked well . broccoli beef was covered in so much sauce it was very overwhelming . the beef texture was fine just way too much sauce super salty and fried rice had no flavor . restaurant inside looks clean but it looks like they need to get better quality vegetables and wash them thoroughly . server did take the vegetable delight entree off the check since we did not touch it too much sauce it was all swimming in sauce . they did apologize i hope they fix it .
asian	the salmon was really dry and i didn 't like the dressing that was on the salad . it came with white rice and that was dry too . was expecting this place to be better , oh well ...
asian	there were 4 of us and server took two orders , left the table at a huff because two at the table was late at ordering . we had to call him back to order the rest of the food . then when we asked for water , he goes he is busy . absolutely horrible experience ! should not be working in the restaurant . we were the only customer in the restaurant .
asian	the food was ok . i had the sashimi benito box . the miso dressing on my salad was watery and bland . i guess they forgot the seaweed salad i ordered . i told the waitress and she didn 't even apologize or ask if i wanted it . when she brought the bill , she said " i took it off the bill for you " with a big smile , like she did me a favor . of course she took it off the bill , i never got it .
asian	i got the thai spicy chicken . they only gave me 4 tiny pieces of chicken and all the rest were big chunks of jalapeños and onions . was in a very salty sauce , which made it impossible for me to eat ! next , i got their noodles . they were below average in taste and were super greasy . half of the noodles were sitting in oil . disappointing again . lastly i got the bourbon chicken , which was just average . a few of the pieces were really dry , but the taste overall was okay . i guess the thing i enjoyed the most was the lemonade . will not be back .
asian	can 't complain like some of the other reviews . but food is really mediocre . ordered their signature and expensive gojira roll . thought with a name like that the roll must be huge and stuffed with fish . wrong ! roll was tiny and literally had a smear of spicy tuna . really stinky small roll totally not worth the price . the maguro sashimi seemed fresh , but all the rest of our lunch was really mediocre . disappointed overall and would not suggest it unless you absolutely have no other choice .
asian	upon ordering the food again took forever and was average at best but overly salty . the drinks were also forgotten and had to be reminded multiple times before the warmish teas arrived which tasted worse than instant . there is no wifi network and cell reception is very weak inside . the bill was never presented but was asked for money on several occasions . there are many other cafes in the area with much better service and food quality . good luck in staying alive in the hyper competitive toronto market
asian	it was aight ... the age-tofu was too breaded ( thin tofu inside : ( ) could use more egg in the fried rice . the amazing tuna roll was not that amazing ... the ahi tuna was seared ? ! i 'll probably give it another try . i came here bc i was desperate for asian food . i 'm an island girl from hawaii now eastcoast livin haha .
asian	my only problem , small case if food poisoning . this had to have come from the tuna toro bc it was the only thing my guest and i shared .. other than that , it was great experience ! i 'm not mean enough to slam them for it , i was eating raw food and maybe the fish ate poison itself .. poor thing : /
asian	ayce , but sitting at the sushi bar we were not allowed to order from the sushi chef , the waitress would take the order , then reach in front of us and hand the slip to the chef . sushi was okay , but i won 't be back . the waitress was condescending in attitude , not sure what they were going for-
asian	the sushi was the thinnest sliver of fish ( like deli meat ) with way too much rice . the hand rolls were terrible as the seaweed was not crispy and really difficult to chew through . tempura was way over battered . the kalbi was sliced super thinly as well . completely diff than what 's pictured in the menu
asian	i had the crispy cashew chicken but chicken was not crispy at all and overall flavour of dish was very blah . i was expecting at least some spice / heat but beside the one lone chili pepper i found , there was nothing . food came warm but certainly not hot . not a great experience and with so many other thai options probably won 't be back
asian	it says soft open on the door and to expect slow service . prices seem reasonable , 7.97 for an extra large bowl of noodles . 3.44 for spring rolls . then the food shows up . the amount of noodles in the xl is about the amount you 'd expect in the large . soup more than noodles . the soup was rather cool . the spring rolls are average , portioned to price . the lime soda has more sugar and soda than there is lime ! not a repeat for me .
asian	ordered # 7 , sesame chicken with white rice and egg roll . they brought me some pile of vegetables covered with peanuts . i requested correct meal with rice and egg roll . messed up again and brought my low mein instead of egg roll .
asian	came for lunch order for to go. took over 20 minutes for chicken salad lunch special. no customer was there. then finally they brought out but no apologized or nothing ... pretty rude and lunch time during work is very limited .... i don 't think i can recommend to nobody like this type of services ....
asian	service was horrible even though there were hardly any patrons in yet . sushi was not fresh . rolls were sloppy and had far too much rice . i will not be back here .
asian	at 1pm , with lots of open tables , they couldn 't seat me . looks like they are having staffing problems . i also have recently experienced inconsistent preparations of the meal , sometimes it is as if a trainee cook prepared the food . so , today , zero stars , but overall two . the food for lunch is overpriced for the quality , but typically acceptable . i eat at the pf changs in asheville regularly as well and find that to be a much better restaurant .
asian	since this place opened , the quality has really gone down . we use to love kanda but this was the last time . the food was horrible , the place was dirty and the service was non-existant !
asian	won 't come back . they kept losing our orders and there was a good half hour we were just sitting and waiting . we asked if there was anything left and they said no , but a whole tray of sashimi came out just as we gave our new orders . when ordering beef tataki , order 2 , 5 or 10 , we kept getting an order of 5 . we got some orders we didn 't even order but we were hungry so ate it anyway . my daughters fell asleep waiting for their stuff . i 'd rather go to our regular ayce resto .
asian	the service was really bad today . i 'll seen people get their own water from the counter . it 's not busy at all . very disappointed here .
asian	came for some vietnamese cuisine but was thrown off and confused with there menu and high glendale prices .
asian	it 's quite expensive when i compare to sushi i have had at home . it wasn 't anything special . quite standard in quality and decor to any other sushi joint . i expected more considering its in the fairmont hotel . we really only chose it after giving up on other places that had a long wait . this was our first night here . suggestion is book ahead ahead yelpers .
asian	the spider special roll we ordered came out as only 5 pieces . the boston roll had almost no shrimp and was filled with lettuce . also it fell apart easily when we tried to pick it up with the chopstick . the spicy shrimp roll had a odd taste in it . i been to many different sushi place around the cleveland and toledo area so i will say it not the worst place for sushi . it does have good prices on sunday , monday and tuesday . but i 'm not sure if i will visit this place again for sushi .
asian	heard good things but this place is bad altogether with service and food . sweet potato fries overly sweet and popcorn chicken wasn 't the greatest either . mediocre food and bad service .
asian	the tea was burnt / old and overly creamy . ordered the satay beef instant noodles , honey garlic chicken wings and fish cutlet spaghetti . food was mediocre but at the price point it 's on par . the chicken wings were decent but the spaghetti was bland and the satay beef was tenderized with meat tenderizer . for $ 1-2 more per dish , i think you can get the same dishes with much better ingredient quality at other diners .
asian	the recipe changed and is thick and gelatinous and now served in a soggy pizza dough bowl . they tried to water down the soup for me and not serve it in the bread / dough bowl - what a joke . still awful . bring back the old recipe- will not be back for the soup .
asian	service order payment and guiding new customers and more ! i see him working back in kitchen wtf ! took long time to oder and then one order came and my friend is just waiting around 5mins for her food ! really and asked for chk and waiting was around 10 real minutes wow !
asian	came from ny to try this place but what a disappointment , i ordered the " lomi noodles soup " they served it with an overcooked noodles , noodles that melt in your mouth how bas was that ... : (
asian	this one taste just ok , not comparable to those in toronto . i don 't known if there 's only a few korean restaurants in montreal , but this one definitely does not reach 4 stars .
asian	last night , their happy hour sushi was bottom of the " barrel " sushi , maybe because it was thursday and they were getting rid of the bottom fish sushi for the easter weekend . atleast they took it off our bill of $ 20.00 since we ate a bite or two and ugh spit it out . the happy hour calif roll was so mediocre , we joked it might have been gas station sushi . very disappointed . yeah , i 'm staying away from here during happy hour .
asian	man this place was so dirty . huge crumbs all over the floor , dirty plates . my cousin had lipstick on her glass , dirt in my glass and on my plate . mid way through dinner we hear this odd noise in the ceiling . i thought maybe it was something settling but it happened 3 different time . rats man . it was rats . never coming back , come here if you like dirty stuff . oh good by the way was mediocre
asian	it was ok then and the crab legs were decent and the variety is nice . unfortantly this last trip is our last the food was just gross to put it bluntly crab legs were slimy and dry weird . service not with any smiles seriously not friendly at all . i 'm sure it 's not the language barrier ! ! to top it off the faculty , the floor , the bathrooms ... no maintaince we should have just bases it on that and just walked away . will not come back beware they are in serious need of a overhaul in management customer service and faculty upgrades . no way i would pay that amount again for this type of service
asian	we had to seat ourselves because no one was there to greet us when we were told to go up and it wasn 't even busy at all . i also had to ask them to replace my water twice because both times i saw something floating in it . we saw their staffs using their phones out in the open which i just find very unprofessional . anyway , food was ok , nothing special other than the fact they 're served in toilets or whatever . would never recommend this place though because of our bad experience and honestly you can find their desserts in other places for a more reasonable price and they would probably be more tastyz
asian	loved their food and the owner ( husband and wife ) was very nice to me . the last time i ate there , i found a hair in my food . sad , because i really liked this place ...
asian	sushi was fresh and the price was fair . fast forward to now .. i 've ordered delivery from them multiple times and the first time was great . i loved that they had uni sushi , it 's something that i always look for when i have sushi . after that , it just went downhill from there . by the time it arrived , it just had this nasty fishy smell and taste . the sashimi was not fresh at all . the uni was not cleaned thoroughly and i had a bite of sand . i thought it was a one off and ordered from them after several months . nope .. same thing .
asian	i tried to eat here yesterday at 6 : 00 pm and found the restaurant to be closed . they never answered their phones , or answered e-mails and never put the right opening hours , or a sign saying that they are closed on their door . it was very disappointing and i don 't think i 'll be trying to come here again anytime soon .
asian	first time service was fast and servers were nicer ... but last time they were slow and kept on omitting some items . the servers started just putting stuff on random corners of the table were you couldn 't reach ( basically , they just dump the food on the table without consideration of the diners ) . i think they don 't have enough menu choices and all the maki rolls seems to taste the same .. bland . quite disappointed overall .
asian	2 stars because i like there spicy wonton and chicken wings other than that i would not come here service is horrible ! they really need to improve there customer service skills if they really want locals to come back
asian	the waitresses never smile and never say thank you , and sometimes they are rude . very disappointed will never return .
asian	poor quality of food , soup was cold , grilled chicken was cold . poor service . was done my food by the time my thai tea came and it was watered down ... worst restaurant i 've ever ate at . somebody put this spot out of business . i will never take a chance on this place again .
asian	lunch service was another story . the food was so so . they got all the usual dim sum fare but quality and taste was below average . some dishes weren 't that tasty . service was also slow and servers looked grumpy . one dish they kept saying was coming but after 30 mins and 3 servers they finally said they were out . should have just told us from the beginning so we didn 't keep waiting . think i 'll try somewhere else next time .
asian	we ordered gyoza , takoyaki , spicy garlic ramen with pork shoulder and shoyu ramen with pork shoulder and extra egg . i was not impressed . the soup base tasted bland , egg was overcooked , pork shoulder tasted burnt and very tough . the gyoza and takoyaki were the only dishes i enjoyed here . i have been to the baldwin location and that one was much better .
asian	got the standard bbq pork along with chicken wings ( not a lot of wing meat ) and a noodle dish . everything was super greasy . even by chinatown standards the service was pretty horrendous . there are lots of better options on this strip . choose wisely !
asian	order a beer which came with a chipped glass and about a 2 inch crack . chicken fried rice and orange chicken was ok but i 've had better . richie rich roll was good . apps were ok again i 've had better . the salmon tartar took 20 minutes but was good . overall experience was not that good . restaurant wasn 't even half full . it 's monday 5pm .
asian	in terms of food i would give 3 stars , the texture of the noodles wasn 't bad however the soup base was not as flavorful as other places i have tried . also , my friends ordered the special and said it was too salty and only made it through half her food . however , the service is terrible . it might be open 24 hours but they are inattentive , not helpful and generally don 't care about their customers . i wouldn 't be back unless no where else is open
asian	thought we 'll try a new restaurant .. what a bad decision . now only did the food took 30 mins to come , the sushi was not fresh at all . the portion were small , even for a lunch portion . i would not recommend coming here . i believe it 's family own business , so when it 's busy - they are lacking staff to attend to the customers .
asian	but it 's nothing to talk about here just a average place . i order some fusion tacos each $ 2 . the food taste like panda express in a taco which its not a good sign . the owner was a little pushy when i was ordering my food to go . the hostess was kind . the place was not neat or that clean as some other reviews talked about . at the end i think they just brought the reviews and all the asian americans and americans just hyped up the place because they don 't know what 's good food from average . the only good thing about this place was the mexican coke !
asian	it 's pretty spacious inside , and seemed relatively busy on a thursday afternoon . got a mini steak and fries for a quick meal and it was all right , nothing too special or amazing . the food could be better ... it seems like lower-end hk cafe style food , so maybe i 'll come back later and try something else .
asian	i ordered dry noodles with beef tendon , shrimp wonton and shrimp / pork dumpling. they gave me about 4 pieces of tendon and 2 pieces each of the dumplings. also had a side of veggies and crispy fish skin. can 't say too much positive things about this place. tables were pretty small and tight. the hot chilly oil was not even hot at all. hot sauce you get at taco bell were hotter tasting than the oil there. if you are looking for wonton noodle places , there are plenty of other ones that are better in my opinion. will i come back ... can 't say i will. place was nothing special and the noodles tasted funny to me .
asian	the parking here is pretty bad , so be prepared to walk a bit ! the staff are friendly , but the service was kinda slow . my boyfriend and i got the oreo bingsu with a poop waffle on the side . honestly , it wasn 't the greatest thing i 've ever tried . it was just okay , not particularly special -- except for the presentation . i don 't think i 'll come back here , but the experience was unique and it 's quite an interesting place !
asian	this place is quite busy . my friends ordered the pho special and i ordered the thai style curry chicken with rice . i would say the sauce is quite good however the meal was underwhelming . it seems like the just poured the curry sauce over boiled chicken and potatoes . the chicken had huge bones in it . not sure about the pho , however my friends said they tasted kinda bland .
asian	got the sushi / sashimi combo and for $ 50 + ( tax tips not included ) all we got were very ordinary pieces of rolls and fish . i can easily go to another takeout place and get a much better deal with higher quality . the fish tasted hard and frozen and the rolls were okay , ayce quality . it was so disappointing since last visit , we found everything to be pretty good . service was pretty much nonexistent . will not be coming back .
asian	egg in the soup was rotten and the meat was cold and extremely salty . asked the waitress for more water and she brought me the bill instead .
asian	also ordered the rice noodle and it had no taste and wasn 't very good .
asian	or order wasn 't even big and checks were hand written so it 's not like there was extra work .
asian	the food is still great . the service was okay but this time when we were about to pay the waitress demanded we give her tips right when she gave us the bill .... i find that a little impolite
asian	the food seems old the soup broth was weird . we didn 't try anything off the normal menu but i would l skip the all you can eat hot pot .
asian	we were seated and was not acknowledge after that . no menus , no water , no tea . after many minutes of waiting , we left . can 't believe how we were treated .
asian	if you want to have a nice meal you can try here . small portions and a large portion of virus . pretty much cash only . if you pay debt they add a surcharge and the tip starts at 11 % . i 've veto this place , as should you .
asian	the chicken fried rice was ....... well the rice first of all didnt have any vegetables it was just chicken and rice fried .... ( ? ) is that normal ? most fried rice i get from pho restaurants have at least onions or peas or carrots lmao but yeah it lacked flavor although they had a large portion size ? ? ? would not come again
asian	the place is packed and doesn 't really have sufficient spacing in there in fever so . ( let alone the parking situation there at night is disgustingly frustrating ) . ordered a few different things with my friends & one was the honey toast with nutella and ice cream . it literally was just bread and chocolate sauce . i felt like i could have just gone home & do the same thing . the staff was okay . they weren 't super friendly but they 're not outright rude . overall , i definitely avoid going back here considering there are so many other places that offer better things .
asian	the pho here sucks . i can make better ones using the pho broth that comes in a can . i ordered the pho tai and the meat tasted like paper , actually maybe a piece of paper would of had more taste . the broth sucks , and so did the noodles . i also ordered the cha gio and instead of using the viet rice paper to wrap it , they used the chinese style egg roll wrapper . never would i come back here again . not even when i 'm starving ! worse pho place ever on earth !
asian	since they close around 2 : 30 there wasn 't a long line , there was only one party in front of us . the decor of the restaurant is really nice and plenty of tables . i decided to order then miso black and i shared the fried chicken . first , the miso black had too much pepper in the soup , which made it taste too seasoned . the fried chicken was also over cooked and tasted too crispy . overall the service was great but the food was mediocre .
asian	when the dish came we noticed a bug in the soup so we asked for it to be remade . after the 2nd one came , we started to eat . as delicious it may be , at the end of the meal , we noticed another bug floating in the soup again .. so two bugs , two noodle soups .. atleast they gave us free mochi lmfao .
asian	this should have been the first sign for me to grab my things and run . i would have saved myself from bland food and saved my pockets some cash . the service was actually really good . our waitress was super nice and accommodating . she explained all the food and what to expect from each dish . she was super quick and got our food out fast . the food however was disappointing . the food was very very bland . i really expected more from the bellagio . i will not be back and with so many different options in vegas i wouldn 't recommend this place to anyone . for the price point you can much better quality food elsewhere .
asian	service sucked . we waited over half an hour for 2 bowls of pho after they gave us the wrong order by accident . pho wasn 't even piping hot when it was served to us . at least it 's open 24 hours though
asian	service is slow since there 's only two people working , but food is good . it 's not your typical pho , so be adventurous and try some new things . the stews are good , and the shrimp rolls are well-made too . they have a really good fish soup with just the right kick as well . we were a large party of 10 , which they easily accommodated before they got busy . but once the place started picking up , service went completely downhill . we waited forever for food , and orders were missed . i feel like i should give this place a second shot with less people , but we 'll see if the opportunity arises again .
asian	the restaurant is fairly big with ample seating . there were many servers around but since we were in a corner we didn 't always get noticed right away . the rolls and combos on the menu are on average a few dollars more expensive than usual , so i expected higher quality . unfortunately , while it 's certainly not bad , quality is just average . would not come again as it 's more expensive than normal .
asian	when we arrived on monday at noon , showed them the coupon , they said it was not valid as it was only for the dinner price . needless to say our party was not pleased as we came here based on this promo . for them to renege on this , which is so clearly written , is unacceptable . do not foresee myself returning for their promotional terms are so uncertain . the manager made no effort whatsoever to speak with us during this confusion . nowhere was there any mention of ' premium lunch ' options on their menu nor promotional materials either . also noticed they had signs at the front stating they only accept cash and debit now .
asian	one of the servers ran to the door to lock it , then shut off their open sign . last call on the door says 12am and so does yelp . you guys need to fix this .
asian	breakfast was okay , portions are small , average menu item is about 20-25 bucks . overall just an okay place , wouldn 't recommend anyone to visit . i would expect better from mandarin oriental . the worst part was the fruit bowl that came out , it was evident that the fruit was cut at least the day before as the edges of the fruits were drying out ... sad !
asian	can 't really review on the food because i sure wasn 't going to pay $ 5 just to be able to sit down to eat and then pay another $ 7 for the actual meal .
asian	there was two people in front of us and it still took 30 minutes to get our food . i ordered the lei burrito . the shrimp tempura in the burrito was soggy , the shrimp was hard and chewey . over priced , long wait , and sub par food . try the other places first .
asian	had to wait 10 minutes for chicken teriyaki , beef with broccoli or fried rice !
asian	he told us that they are closed . on yelp it states that they are closed at 5 . he said that they are not affiliated with yelp . i guess they won 't care about this review either then . maybe they have too much business and do not want anymore . been here over 10 times and this will be he last time .
asian	upon walking in , the entrance is a short small corridor that is basically single file as they seem to cram tables where they can upon entering , a table for 4 was just leaving . when the waitress came over she asked for " how many , " which we said 2 . she then said " fully booked " and turned away . no clue why they would ask for how many if they are fully booked . also no clue why they would just say " fully booked " when a table for 4 just left . can 't recommend at all , and won 't be coming back .
asian	came here at 9 : 20pm .. waitress said kitchen is closed .. i checked on the door , it says friday the restaurant closes at 1130pm .. not impressed at all
asian	the ladies at the restaurant said they were closed but their business hours on yelp said 10pm closure . with all the good reviews i read . i was pretty damn disappointed . on top of that i 'm never in henderson / green valley .
asian	i ordered noodles , they don 't have it . i ordered taro boba , they also don 't have it . i ordered shrimp , they don 't have it . soooo what do you guys have ? theres a whole menu with nothing . . please re up your inventory . bad 1st impression .
asian	when i walked in there were no other customers . ordered the shrimp with vegetables and my friend ordered kung pao chicken . the food was fresh and came out quick . staff was nice . the food though wasn 't that great : my 6 pieces of shrimp were basic and over sauced and my friends chicken was dry . i guess i just expected better food but , the prices were reasonable . wouldn 't bother going back though .
asian	it took them a while to even get to pour my tea and before i even left the waitress even ask me to give her more tips .
asian	the decor with tablecloth and highback chairs seem to indicate it 's pricey but whatever we got was totally not spicy enough ! avoid and go to the glass tabled place up the street !
asian	i was in the area and seriously craving a meat , rice , veggie , soup dish . came for chinese bbq and was disappointed . restaurant was completely empty which was a bad sign , showing cold / old meats and little turnover . server explained difference between bowl and dish as $ 1 dollar difference for wayyyy more meat and rice . ok . she up-sold me . i plead the fifth . the roasted pork was cold . i kid u not . ive never had bbq that was cold . warm , yes , but cold , never ! the duck was nothing special , all bones no meat . i will not return to this place .
asian	i would give a 4 stars for the food . however i received awful service just because i did not hear them calling out my number . i was super disappointed with the way they acted . super rude .
asian	heavy , heavy sauce , rolls fall right apart ... just overall not good . will not be back .
asian	sushi was just ok . what turned me off was the service . they all look so glum and don 't even smile at their customers .
asian	i had 3 bites , each bite trying to just accept that it wasn 't that good and just eat it ... i couldn 't . i have no idea why the high reviews . my husband thought it was disgusting too . the popcorn chicken had good flavor seasoning but the meat could not be identified ... looked and tasted like animal byproduct . only positive is the nice decor , which is very modern . maybe the good reviews are coming from people just coming in for tea ? i 'm so confused .
asian	service : - prompt and typical of asian places - accommodated us when i called in advance to ensure a table ( there were 6 of us ) food : - portions are small - beef onion pancake and soup dumplings weren 't great ... i 've definitely had better . beef was rather bland , and the dumpling skin was thin and wasn 't as " springy " - red bean meringue puffs were fairly good though the meringue was a bit heavy ... not sure what they added to it - hot and sour soup was decent - their non-spicy version of szechuan green beans were really good glad i tried it but will probably continue my search for alternatives to din tai fung .
asian	chicken tasted really funny with strange texture in curry chicken my son ordered .
asian	ordered the beef and broccoli and fried rice to go . i 'm not sure what kind of meat they use but it is not beef . flavors were bland and nothing note worthy or anything worth 3 + stars . my gf got the wonton soup and was also disappointed . makes me wonder about these other 4 star reviews . there 's no way unless you 've never had good food
asian	she said the go to dish is the black bean noodle , but they of course was sold out . instead , i had the chicken katsu . it was crispy , but thin stripped . the other people came had an alright experience , it would be more worth it if it was less than $ 10 a plate .
asian	very unsanitary . i had to go through 3 cups to finally get one that looks decently clean to drink from .
asian	the popcorn chicken here is seasoned so they don 't provide you with any dipping sauce . that 's exactly what they told me when i asked for sauce . lol . but it was so salty .. and the pieces are huge , in a bad way . not very popcorn-like . and calamari is really hard . also salty . it was all weird . i probably would be more gracious with stars if they would have just given me some damn sauce .
asian	i think the sushi was not that fresh and you could tell when you ate it . ribs dish came to our table cold and avacado was mushy . tempura and presentation of food and the service was good though . would not come back .
asian	wouldn 't recommend it if that 's what you 're coming in for , the dim sum menu was small , not of much variety and not good taste wise .
asian	idk , it 's just like ... it 's a typical asian place to have other dishes too , not just noodle soups and other random things . then again , i 'm also really picky . maybe i 'll come here another day and try out their pho or something .
asian	i was sadly mistaken . the employees didn 't know anything about allergens . i probably could have kept it simple with unmarinated fish and rice , but i cannot risk getting sick . so my husband kept it simple and risked it , but i unfortunately could not get anything . my niece ordered an açaí bowl , only to be told a few minutes later they didn 't have the ingredients . only reason i gave two stars was because my husband said his sushi burrito was pretty good . the staff should be better trained on ingredients . they should know what is in the food they 're serving .
asian	only ate a bit of it , i gave the benefit of the doubt that they may have been busy throughout the day , but the floor was messy . bad quality . people really seemed to like this place , i 'm not sure why
asian	proved to be an absolutely mediocre restaurant . the buffet choices for vegetarians were horrible . the food tasted ok hence the two stars otherwise i 'd given one star . don 't get the mango lassi . it 's basically mango juice . when i confronted the server he said that it 's how it 's made which leads me to believe the staff is misinformed regarding their own cuisine and not accommodative .
asian	long wait .. waited an hour for 4 people . rude staff , bad service , and food was not good . the only thing that i could finish was the tripe , soybean dessert , and the fried dough with steamed rice wrap . chicken feet was bland and straight out of the freezer . the sweet egg yolk layered cake made me gag . egg yolk baos was not good . sui mai was alright . the lady spilled the whole soy sauce on our table .. tea is calculated by person .. bathrooms were gross and nasty .. never going back , never again .
asian	the menu had a wide variety of rolls but out of the 6 rolls we ordered we liked the screaming honey the most . the waiters were attentive and checked up on us occasionally . presentation of the food was okay . lighting was okay . there was nothing that wowed me .
asian	i 'll be honest , i had better . the wait time to get dim sum such as the chicken feet , tripe , spare ribs , etc took about : 30mins since we were seated . the tripe and spare ribs were bland . only good thing was the fried rice and noodles .
asian	i tried the sushi but not the mariscos so i cannot say anything about that . we were seated fast . place was pretty empty for being a friday night " which shoulda been a warning .. " the sushi is way over priced in my opinion , and has almost no flavor . the presentation is great it looks very nice , but it does not taste as good as it looks . the rolls are topped with a lot of unnecessary stuff like imitation crab and extra shrimp which is not needed . i would not recommend it if you are coming here to eat sushi . stick to a real sushi place . we will not be returning .
asian	but when i got here i was very disappointed ... i mean , i am no ramen expert but i did not enjoy my meal at all ... the broths were very bland & i think that the only good part to the ramen was the pork belly and the egg . i wish that i didn 't have to spend $ 14 on a bowl of ramen that i did not enjoy ... i could 've made instant ramen at home and i would have enjoyed it more ... on the other hand the pork buns were pretty good , i probably would only go there for the appetizers if i was hungry in the area .... just my opinion
asian	sushi was fair , nothing to rave about . we figured well had 50 dollar gift card no expiration date on it so it would be a wash . they would not honor it saying it was a year old again no expiration date . then they said they would give us 15 % off our bill . i get the bill and the 15 % was only for non happy hour food . on a 55 dollar bill we got 4 dollars off. if you want great sashimi and service hana on 7th ave clearly is at the top of the list . they serve fresh thick cut sashimi there sushi is flavorful and well prepared .
asian	sadly , i didn 't have the same experience . the group i was with and i were very disappointed . we had to almost beg them to come out with food and water . they kept disappearing . we didn 't even receive tongs or scissors to cut the food and stir it around . the guy would leave after we ordered and didn 't return . we had to get up multiple times to find someone to bring us what we ask for . we were there for 2 hours and left hungry . we will not be returning .
asian	we ordered the original dak galbi and it was digustingly sweet . all we could taste was the sugar , it was so overpowering and nasty . i don 't get how this place get good reviews ? maybe the other location is better but i don 't want to go back after that experience . the sided dishes werent much better either . everything was just overly sweet it felt like i was eating dessert instead of dinner . gross .
asian	it was not bad but all the food was pretty typical and average . i 've had better kebabs elsewhere and nothing was that flavourful . definitely would not drive out here to try the place if i wasn 't already in the area . the falafal was probably the best dish we had that night .
asian	although yelp says it opens till 11 , the final word from owner is that it closes at 9 : 30pm even though their door says 10pm . we arrived at 8pm and pretty much all there was left was rice and sauce . the person at cashier also said in order to use the restaurant.com coupon we had to order drinks or it will be charged on the bill anyway . well the coupon didn 't mention that we had to get drinks . what a scam . sauce was really spicy . never coming back .
asian	it was so bad . one of the worst ayce places . hardly any of the usual rolls options . no green / red dragon , dynamite etc . place smelt funny , was empty on a saturday afternoon , staff useless and a few rice flies around . enjoy .
asian	this place had no character , the waitress had no character either , just came and left . mandatory to tip 10 % the food wasn 't very good . best thing there was the jello . wouldn 't return .
asian	i got pho and it was so salty i couldn 't eat it . the service was slow and my boyfriend got the pad thai and it was tasteless and very salty . wouldn 't recommend it
asian	the only bonus is the cheap price but the food quality is poor . we ordered sashimi for 2 person and eel dynamite rolls . the rolls are huge . the rolls arent so bad but we will not return to this place anymore .
asian	i been wanting to try this place before they changed their name , not sure if they changed their ownership too . anyways , since much money was lost in vegas and we needed to cut on the food budget , we decided to get some pho off the strip , also to help with hangovers . we got here , it wasn 't too busy , the parking lot is actually kind of small . anyways , their spring rolls are okay . the pork spring roll sauce was too thick for my liking . their pho soup base is a little too sweet . it didn 't really satisfy anyone 's craving . we were a little disappointed : (
asian	ordered a large pho ( with fresh noodles ) and a bunh xeo to share . both were bland and not exciting . the bunh xeo was soggy and was just all beansprouts . the pho smelled like raw pork .. definitely not very pleasant .
asian	it was not that busy when we arrived . we ordered the rock shrimp and it was really good . the sushi was fresh . service was okay .. the manger was eyeing us the whole time which made my family and i very uncomfortable maybe because we ordered a lot and stayed for an 1 hr , but no reason to eye us down like that and make us feel uncomfortable . like a pervious reviewer said we were the only asian customers there . why the two star then ? as we were getting ready to leave my sister heard the owner ask the waiter how much i tipped her and then she mad a disgusted face . i wont be going there again .
asian	definitely not authentic pho . owner by chinese and they cooked the fried spring roll like chinese spring roll . ordered their bun bo hue and it tasted like they used the bun bo hue paste that can be found on any chinatown shelf . would not recommend if you are looking for real vietnamese food . gave two star for the service .
asian	majorly overpriced , tiny portions , tasteless ramen ... worse than instant noodles . never returning here .
asian	very underwhelmed to say the least . fish wasn 't very fresh , rice was too warm when served so it stuck to the plate after cooling & service was terrible . the menu literally said we got soup , salad & vegetable tempura with our nigiri combo order , but our waiter mad us choose and acted like we were jerks for wanting what we should be getting . stick to jjanga or goyemon . this place isn 't worth your time or $ $ $
asian	server was great but whoever was in the kitchen tonight said i only had three options . seriously ? i 've been here before ! oh well , we were hungry so i simply got the salmon roll , which is just salmon and rice , thinking it 'd be very difficult to mess up . then they brought out my gf roll on the same plate as the gluten roll ! ! ! we even wrote gf on the ticket next to the roll - just one extra step to inform the kitchen about my allergy . on top of that they were out of gf soy sauce , which i was informed of after ordering .
asian	unfortunately i was horribly disappointed . this place is nothing special . the service was sub par . they kept trying to push the daily specials on us . they did not bring us any water or tea . we had ordered a side of rice which we did not receive yet they tried to charge us for . we got some sushi and tempura shrimp . both were mediocre . all in all , i won 't be going back there again .
asian	the interior is very nice . however , the food was not that good . the food was salty or bland . i don 't think i will come back .
asian	if i hadn 't felt so sick afterwards i 'd probably give it a 3.5 for being a fun movie theatre sneak in food , not too bad tasting and generous servings . but i did feel sick afterwards- i 'm not sure if it was the amount of oil and sugar in the meal- or a mild case of food poisoning , but i 'll have to give it a two for the tummy ache .
asian	i don 't really understand why this place is so popular--it was packed on christmas eve . everything was extremely mediocre and not worth the price . i 've never eaten so little sashimi at an all you can eat place--it just wasn 't good .
asian	wish we had turned around . the place is very dated inside . the food was mediocre at best . the hibachi chef was no where to be found , although i believe there selection was better , the cook top he was using needed to be cleaned . the food tasted like dirty oil and i couldn 't eat it . the sushi was standard for buffet sushi , it didn 't stand out even though it is the focal point of this place . the buffet food in general was sub par for buffet food . price was a bit on the high end for the quality ( i know its a chinese buffet , im not expecting world class food ) wont be back .
asian	we walked in around noon . there was only 2 other customers in the restaurant . i like the ambiance . nice place but food is below mediocre . they don 't serve pouccin anymore ( kinda came here for pouccin ) . the bar girl said they changed the menu a year ago . i am very disappointed with this place . the price is very high and service was bad . it seems there is no team work at this restaurant .
asian	oopssssssss ....... save the time and gas but didn 't satisfy my craving : ( soup tasted like those instant noodle soup , ramen was worse than nissin cup noodles in the plane , chashu was dry . hmmmm ............ is this a ramen place ? ? ! ! i wondered ............
asian	service sucks , the food came out over an hour later for 2 bowls of soup , and fishball skewer which was soooooooo raw / undercooked . i don 't recommend this place . if you come here just place an order for pick up and leeeeeave ! ! !
asian	since it 's a holiday monday , parking was scarce but the restaurant was somewhat empty . i had the miso ramen ( $ 8 ) with a side of pork belly ( $ 3-4 ) and it lacked flavour ... nothing exciting really . the place was clean , even the washroom . no complaints about service . but the food was so mediocre , maybe the rest of the menu is better .
asian	to my disappointment , i got my chicken barbecue and all i can taste was bitter carbon deposits from the charred remains of a chicken . which is also cancerous by the way . but the food was cheap . i wouldn 't come here again unless they learn how too cook their food properly . it is a health hazard .
asian	my first impression upon walking in was the horrid chemical smell ; it smelled like a nail salon and not a restaurant . the service was not friendly , barely got a verbal acknowledgement let alone a smile from our server . the sushi did not taste very good . our server even tried to correct a party at another table who said that their order was wrong by bringing them the original ticket which actually showed that the party was right and the server had put in order wrong . not very professional . there was not one thing that would make me want to return .
asian	their online menu showed items they didn 't have on their current menu ( garlic soy sauce ) and staff pushed the upsell items after i said i had all wanted in my bowl . other poke places mix the sauce with the fish only but this place pours it on top of everything leaving sauceless fish and saturated rice . i found an unexpected extra in my bowl when i got home , a piece of plastic . no thank you .
asian	the restaurant was 1 / 4 occupied . this branch is cleaner and more spacious compared to the rainbow / sahara branch . food ? that 's questionable . i understand that it 's cheap but the quality of food that you get is the same thing ... the only one good dish here is the cubed beef with gravy . the rest is blah !
asian	when we got the bill we got charged the full price and no apologies even when confronted . for the price you 're paying , deer garden or chef papa is a lot better quality .
asian	ordered from their lunch menu that comes with a drink . food came fast ordered the baked chicken spaghetti and cheese with cream sauce and the chicken steak and pork chop with gravy sauce on rice . the baked chicken spaghetti and cheese with cream sauce had very little cheese , all cream sauce . taste wasn 't there but good portion size the chicken steak and pork chop with gravy sauce on rice was ok silky hk milk tea , though it wasn 't hot like i was use to
asian	two people walked in after me and got service before me . the food is ok , nothing spectacular . i use to love this spot , but they 've fallen off .
asian	wasn 't that busy with just another 3 , 4 tables . everyone kept waiting for their food for over 40 minutes , while the waitress just kept apologizing . mind you some of these folks were on their lunch break so they didn 't have all day ( nor should they have to wait all day ) . our order finally came and they actually got one of the rolls wrong . our consolation prize was a little piece of mochi and the pathetic excuse that their kitchen was backed up . the quality of the sushi wasn 't anything spectacular either , there are easily many different places nearby that are tastier and offer much less of a wait . do not go .
asian	the staff were super friendly and i got my poke burrito right away . however , i was very unimpressed with the size of it ; its way less than what i could have got for the similar price at other poke restaurants , like rolltation or even poke guys . there was very little fish and very little everything in general . would be returning after their opening phrase to see if they 've improved , but won 't be going back until then .
asian	? how can 2 people order enough for 18 people ! ! not everyone eats the same dishes ..... i have never experienced such atrocious service before in a restaurant where i was not allowed to order .... this place deserves negative stars .
asian	that busy . placed my order , and they brought the incorrect dish . due to time constraints i ate it anyway , and frankly the food is sub par . the house white whine was lame . after dinner , they whisked the plates away and brought the bill right away . they did not bring the included dessert either at this point , i was just happy to pay and leave . time to rebuild this palace folks !
asian	left happy because that was what we came here for . all other foods looks really nice but it was not good at all . dessert selection was small and was not good . texture and taste were off . i suggest they take away their asian selection because it was not asian to me at all . sushi looked really nice but i was already able to tell that it didn 't taste good before eating it .
asian	no wonder my friend and i got sick the next morning . the ramen ( base or broth ) in a nutshell for us was bland and the noodles didn 't have any real flavor , they weren 't even cooked properly . really disappointed in this place .
asian	verdict : bland ! ! will not come back at all . $ 10 tax and tip included not worth it . take your money somewhere
asian	don 't believe the coupon . even though the coupon doesn 't state it must be printed , and says no photocopies , they require it to be printed . she offered a " small " discount but couldn 't apply the coupon because it wasn 't printed . how ridiculous . lady at the counter wasn 't rude necessarily , but was impersonal and not customer service oriented . not likely to return . follow up after getting food : daughter got chicken terriyaki bowl and the chicken was good . i got the orange chicken , tried about 3 bites and hard to return to exchange . it was extremely over cooked and chewy .
asian	the server or " the captain " was very pushy and kept trying to push higher price point items . i will say the appetizers were delicious however the main course not only lacked flavor but also seemed like it was lesser quality meet . overall , i would not recommend eating here again .
asian	the atmosphere was typical , clean and the staff were friendly . i looked under the hoods ( as advised from previous posts ) and there were still a couple mildew spots . tried a smidgen of everything and nothing tasted fresh . safe to say i didn 't go back for seconds on anything and i 'm probably not going to be returning unless of course another free meal is being offered . but even then i 'll have to really like the person i 'm going for !
asian	first they said we didn 't have a reservation . then they found it and apologized that it was accidentally made at 6am instead of 6pm . then there was drama about chairs and how we weren 't allowed to have as many as we needed ? and the whole time the host is being so aggressive and yelling at us ... this was my first time here and it will be my last .
asian	i expected better from the raving reviews online . my order was their sweet and sour noodles , but i felt i was eating an overly sweet , bland cream sauce - there was absolutely no trace of their asserted " tangy almond butter sauce . " flavours all fell flat for me . my friend did , however , enjoy his burstin ' burrito and from my tasting of my other friend 's pad thai noodles , they were decent . don 't come here expecting a good value for your meal !
asian	we made reservations ( 8 pm ) and showed up with our entire party an hour early ( 7pm ) . we didn 't get seated until 845pm . we sat for 20 minutes before anyone even came over to take our drink orders . the only highlight was our chef who when he showed up tried to be entertaining . i will not be returning and will not be recommending anyone go .
asian	i had the rare beef pho and a side of spring rolls here . the price is pretty cheap and the portion is decent ( slightly on the large side ) . the pho is average , i found that it wasn 't as chewy as i 'd like it . the broth was flavourful . the spring rolls were very crispy and fresh and were only $ 2.50 ! overall the food tasted decent , however , i got a stomach ache after and i 'm not sure if it was caused by raw the bean sprouts , or something in the pho .
asian	edemame didn 't have much salt , server took forever , got vegetarian fried rice and shrimp fried rice ... so gross ! ! , if you want good fried rice go to ah-so sushi & i steak , 4.00 for a side of rice , and quality food . after leaving : didn 't tip because sadly , poor college students and the service wasn 't good , nor food . the server ran out and asked us to never come back because of it ! !
asian	both the date and the food . service was slow and inattentive , the food was sub-par , and the sushi was luke-warmish which is just wrong when it comes to raw fish . the place was loud and obnoxious . way too much like the other crap along mill avenue . i tried the neighboring location just up scottsdale road and it was definitely much better . if you hate yourself and want to get sick , go here . if not , keep walking .
asian	the hostess refuse to seat us even when there are open seatings . she insisted that three of us should fit on a tiny table for 2 . and refused to merge the other 2 person table right next to it . she insisted she needed to merge this table with an existing table with family already eating . and they did not complain about their seating ... this place is completely unprofessional and 0 customer service .. won 't ever come here again
asian	we used to come here a lot years ago . the chef was really entertaining but the food was so so . i ordered black cod and it was over cooked and no flavor .
asian	we were allowed to make a reservation for 10 . the server was very slow and service . and we had wanted to order 4 orders of the yellowtail collar but they only had one order left . i ordered the tofu soup with the bulgogi combo . the bulgogi wasn 't even sizzling on the hot plate . when most of us opened our rice bowls it look like it was eating into only two of them look like they were new . it took us a while to grab the server 's attention to let her know about the rice bowls .
asian	quality was good but our server was super rude kept coming by and i felt like every time we ordered she had a attitude about it . they close at 12 we got there around 9 : 00 stayed till 10 : 00 they shut off our vents while we were still cooking food and our waitress came up and asked if we were going to finish our food or they will charge us . of course we would finish it with the group we had . i understand rules but don 't be presumptuous about it . i rather go to hobak or gen .
asian	came here for afternoon tea , got the baked portuguese chicken and it was the worst baked rice dish i ha e ever had , the chicken tasted like it was boiled and just covered with sauce to hide the bland flavour , never ever coming back to this crappy place again
asian	i ordered the chicken omelet in white sauce with fries , and my husband ordered the beef brisket noodles . the mushrooms in the omelet were not fresh and from cans , the fries basically tasted like cheap frozen fries that were reheated , the beef brisket was slightly tough . their dinner meals aren 't bad but won 't come back again for afternoon tea unless hungry , tired and desperate .
asian	we came for all you can eat and 1st of all the service was terrible , 2nd bathrooms were dirty . the over the top to make me write this was a friend of mine ordered a roll and left one piece on her plate and they charged her for the whole roll ! they also gave us a roll that tasted a bit off and when we told the waitress she said if we don 't eat she will charge , after 10 minutes of arguing the manager came and said no charge after i said i just won 't pay !
asian	we made reservations beforehand - this place is boutique-sized and gets packed very quickly during prime time . service was extremely slow . angelhair basilico - pasta ( 2.5 / 5 ) ( with basil & plum tomato sauce + chicken ) this was meeeh : ( i usually like angelhair pastas but the taste of this pasta became bland really quickly . the chicken bits , which i 've added to my meal , were very dry and it was not marinated with the sauce of the pasta so the flavour seemed out of place .
asian	looks like some of the speciality items were good but we were encouraged to order from the set menu which was pretty standard and massively overpriced . we were told it was ok to bring kids but they did not seem very kid friendly . to top things off , we went back to the car and had been broken into ! parking is not safe here ! would not go back .
asian	we had the mongolian beef and the crab fried rice . the mongolian beef was decent , robust beefy goodness , however the side of rice was gummy and smooshed together . kinda gross . the crab fried rice had a limited amount of crab and tasted a little on the bland side . i had to pour on the siracha to add some flavor . service was average but i don 't think i will come back as there is a better thai resturant around the corner .
asian	opted for the butter chicken bowl with basmati rice . the woman there gave me 2 scoops of rice and a scoop of chicken . in that scoop it contained four small pieces of chicken . it probably wasn 't even one breast total . $ 7.99 . taste was on par with other butter chicken dishes i 've had , nothing spectacular . rice was decently fragrant and cooked well . small portions for the bowl meals .
asian	we did not order well . none of my friends wanted to get seafood so i ended up getting the crispy beef . everything was edible but nothing struck me as really memorable . i will try to go back and get some of the house specialities .
asian	it was fairly empty with only 2 other tables seated . so the service was prompt . the best part was the owner , she was sitting in the corner with her gigantic plate of crab legs to herself and complaining loudly over the phone and to her staff that she had no one to eat it with and must have taken 30 photos of the crab legs on her phone . it was just a hilarious gluttony sight to see . the food was alright , nothing to complain about . it came out hot and fresh which was good .
asian	place was filthy , napkins and food all over the floor . service was cold , like the waiters all didn 't want to work there . we ordered 4 dishes which were completely forgettable . food was completely boring , no wok hay at all . if you want to have cheaper food at odd times then sure come here . but if you want quality , best to look elsewhere .
asian	i order 6 pieces of sushi roll . wasn 't bad , until i got my bill . just under $ 50 for 6 pieces of maki and a coke .
asian	we ordered : - bun bo hue : flavour was okay , nothing special , but the noodles were overcooked - curry chicken noodle : the vermicelli was way overcooked to the point where it became mush . soup was lacking flavour service was friendly but the food was just not good . i don 't recommend this restaurant unless you really really crave viet food ...
asian	finally when he saw us " giving him the eye " is when he came .. the food was okay not to expensive ... could have been better , literally had to keep flagging him down .. the services overall sucked
asian	the salmon was overcooked . the rest of the food ( rice , salad , miso ) wad as expected . the kappa maki that came with it was a bit warm . overall , value was there but food was very unremarkable . place is pretty modern and clean looking in comparison to the other strip mall restaurants .
asian	i have slightly higher standards for sushi so i may be a little biased but when i ordered the sashimi lunch the temperature was borderline thawing . friend ordered the torched sushi which looked pretty good , but price is a little steep for what it is .
asian	i was really surprised that from the moment i paid , i was able to pick up my order within 2-3 mins . the ramen itself wasn 't really good though . the broth was very very salty and the noodles had a " instant noodle " feel to it . in fact , some instant ramens brands are even better . only giving two stars to due the speed of the service
asian	i realized that many time i come here , they only they soup to their usual hk clients .
asian	the tempura was really nice , not too oily and plenty of flavour . the teriyaki was just too chewy with the sauce trying to hide that fact . was not impressed by the food at all . the restaurant itself is split in two sections separated by a narrow walkway between the kitchen . to the front of the shop is the more claustrophobic section and to the rear is the more open cafe type seating although might possibly get a whiff from the bog if seated close enough . for the price the food was okay , would like to try their sushi but with other options nearby it would have to be pushed to the back of the pack for now .
asian	our server was nice and recommended some martinis but they were basically all sweet and sour . all of the special rolls we ordered were not good . it 's like the nori was stale or something . the salad wasn 't good , the teriyaki beef was super plain and chewy and came with a big scoop of rice and a salad . it was just disappointing because the only decent thing was the tuna nigiri . even the ice cream and mochi was subpar .
asian	i definitely will not be coming back . first , we did not receive the appetizer we ordered ( it was left on the bill and we had to have them remove it ) . second , the service was incredibly slow and it wasn 't even that busy . we were there for an hour and a half . it took 40 minutes for our sushi to come out . and lastly , the sushi wasn 't even that good . if you 're looking for a sushi place , do not go here .
asian	the selection is a lot smaller compared to the menu on the website , however the sashimi was fresher than most other ayce places and doesn 't have the frozen fish taste . the selection of desert was delightfull , but i found the mango serbet thing to be too tart and tanic . a word of advice avoid the torch sushi or anything torched , i may have came on a bad day but every torched item tasted of raw propane , probaly from a torch with a dirty flame .
asian	i live in the area and was tired of the usual sandwich shops and bar food . i ordered the shumai and the spicy tuna roll . the shumai were tiny ( think the frozen stuff you find at the grocery store ) . i wasn 't all to impressed with the sushi either . it was ok for a quick fix but i probably won 't be back . i 'll gladly drive a few more minutes for better sushi .
asian	off the top of my head , we had some bao , takoyaki , and katsu curry with rice . it was filling , but probably a bit too expensive for the quality of food that we had .
asian	i 'm not a fan of chicken broth so i ordered the pork broth black garlicky ramen ( additional $ 1 for pork instead of chicken ) . wasn 't happy about the extra cost for pork broth but thought i 'd give it a try anyways . portion is small and the broth is too bland and just warm. only good thing about this place is service , but otherwise wouldn 't come here again even to satisfy my ramen craving .
asian	sushi was below average for an ayce place , the salmon was quite tasteless and didn 't seem fresh . however , the fried / grilled foods ( tempura , short ribs , etc . ) were not bad , it was quite hot and not too oily . service was not great either , we asked for more sauce and napkins twice and the server walked by several times and never brought it to us . lunch ayce includes pop , but the price is relatively higher than other ayce places . hence , i would not return again as there are many better and more convenient options in the area .
asian	there were not a lot of tables , but towards the end of dinner , the waitress kept rushing us to finish . she came 3 times in 10 minutes to ask if we were done eating yet . she brought out the check before we ate our dessert . overall this place is clean , service is mediocre , and pretty much the run of the mill type of thai food . the only dish i liked was the larb salad ... just make sure to ask for more cabbage , they are pretty stingy .
asian	one word - yuk . food was very greasy . many items were not re-filled . sushi a few notches below your average ayce place . i will never be back .
asian	price is the same as most places ( 12.99 $ ) but it 's one of the worst ayce i 've been to . they 're really stingy on fish in nigiris and rolls , a lot of rice in everything . selection is really small , no eel . some items from our order just got forgotten service is slow and diners who order from the à la carte menu are prioritized . not a good experience , don 't eat here .
asian	the selection is very limited . no shrimp tempura , no beef teriyaki . the food is average . service is non existent . i finished my tea and they never come around to refill it . even after we ask for more tea , they never came around to refill . there are better ayce in woodbridge .
asian	rolls were mushy , i swear some of it was microwaved ( the dragon roll ) . the white tuna had a strange gritty texture to it and was super watery . the chicken udon came without chicken and was just a pile of stir-fried udon on a plate . every dish was sub-par . and in the end , it costed over $ 20 a head . never coming back here again .
asian	first , when you walk in you 'll notice it is not the cleanest of places but we tried to overlook that as we thought we would be pleased by our drinks . the pearls in my drink were scarce and a bit too soft . the drink was not blended very well at all so some chunks of ice were kind of large . the drink is also made with a premade syrup from a jug which was surprising as this is an authentic thai restaurant . the taste was watered down , not delicious at all . cute interior but definitely would not come back .
asian	came here for breakfast ; arrived at 10 : 30am ; ordered a simple ham macaroni and toast ; waited for more than 45 min before getting the order ; most likely the waiter forgot to put in order / kitchen lost our order ; waiters were not attentive at all , except one waitress ; hot hk style tea was not that good either .
asian	was not impressed with the service and quality of food . the workers were warming buns bought from the store with no gloves what so ever and touching other stuff thereon after / before , not sanitary . the food is very simple for breakfast ( chicken , beef satay noodle soup ) you can add an egg , ham and bun for an additional $ 2 . most likely won 't be back ..
asian	my friend and i were on guestlist -- still ended up waiting about 30 mins in line . the club got super super crowded , to the point where you just couldn 't walk anywhere . there is absolutely no where to chill too . who wants to dance for 8 hours straight ? ! never coming back here .
asian	sitting in front of a table with a staff wrapping wonton in front of me . after watching her doing it , i would not come here to eat wonton . the lady was sneezing while wrapping , then rubbing her nose and talk non stop . imagine how clean the wonton could be ! horrible ! !
asian	i do not recommend this place . i would go to joyful down the street over this . average food cost / person : $ 12 food : palatable - shrimp pan fried noodle hong kong style ( shrimps on the smaller side ) skip - salt and pepper pork chop ( barely any meat mostly fat ) curry beef brisket ( connective tissue , beef was tender , lacking in flavor ) environment : not very clean - table was sticky , walls dirty , chairs old and worn service : very poor - waited 20 minutes for food . one of our dishes came 10 minutes after that . outside of ordering and dropping off , no interaction with the wait staff .
asian	i know it was new yrs but this place was a zoo and dinner service was a complete disaster. we recieved dishes belonging to other tables , we recieved all our entree dishes at once then the soup arrives at the very end , the food was really not up to standard with even average chinese restaurants. the seating arrangement was so uncomfortable ever time a waiter passed by ; you would get a physical nudge like you were at some college nightclub . waiters were trying to help each other out but there was total miscommunication and chaos. i imagine the trading floor of the new york stock exchange in sept 2008 was similar to this .
asian	when the server took my order i asked for thai tea and he looked at me like i was crazy so i 'm guessing that 's a no . then i asked if they have shark 's fin for dim sum , he turned to his coworker and started speaking in another language and started laughing all i understood was thai tea and shark 's fin . very unprofessional if you 're going to speak about a customers order do it in the kitchen and not near the customer . horrible experience . never again if you want decent dimsum drive to orchid 's
asian	everything we ordered was meh especially for what we paid for . there 's cheaper restaurants that tastes way better . we ordered things like ha gow , shrimp spring rolls , bbq pork buns , sticky rice , dough fritter rice rolls etc . my favorite dimsum dish is the deep fried taro with minced meat inside and it did not taste good here at all . i found the taro to be very bland and dense . we even got charged $ 1.20 for water . it wasn 't even bottled , pretty sure it was tap . so regardless if you order tea or water , you 're going to have to pay . sigh not coming back .
asian	restaurant seems to be very popular for seniors , probably because they give you free newspaper . food was nothing special . ran out of egg tart was offer milk tart instead . got the tofu dessert which wasn 't as smooth as expected . custard bun was my favourite but some have more filling then other . just a fyi let it cool down a bit service wise was pretty brutal , ask a server for napkins and told to ask someone else because she is carrying dim sum . typical can 't expect much service from these place , even saw two employees arguing with each other smh .
asian	there weren 't too many options for dimsum as the options for steamed dimsum were quite limited .. but they had a fried noodle / rice section and chefs special . we had their kidney bean fried noodle which tasted pretty good . however-the steamed dimsum didn 't live up to the interior decoration .. it was rather mediocre . i cant say for the quality of dinner as i haven 't tried it yet . but i did see other tables ordering lobsters and other seafood for lunch . service was pretty good . i wouldn 't come back for dimsum again as there many more dimsum places that offer better selection .
asian	overall , the meal wasn 't great . although the bbq pork buns were fresh and tasty , the majority of the dishes were bland and flavourless . i ordered two noodle specialty dishes which were fairly expensive ( about $ 15 each ) and neither one had much flavour to it . the shrimp cheung fun was also pretty bland . i definitely won 't be coming back here .
asian	the price seemed good and there was a lineup considering it was a weekday . but when we actually got in , the service was terrible . they were having a lot of problems in the kitchen because all the waiters were confused and scrambling around . total time we waited was around an hour or so but we just ordered 7 things .
asian	pretty much your standard dim sum place , has everything from siu mai , shrimp rice noodles , har gow , etc . i didn 't really find these outstanding . i 've had better . we came pretty early before the rush , so it was pretty dead . service was good . although when i asked for chili pepper sauce they gave a tiny sauce plate .
asian	my friend and i were the only ones there . that being said , the service was terrible , i waited about 15 minutes before i got a refill on water . the food was mediocre . ordered the sesame chicken and i could tell it was not fresh , had a weird taste to it . the rice was cold . the only thing i managed to eat with no problem were the crab angels . the check was brought to us immediately after our food was , made us feel rushed . over all , just not a good experience . would rather have spent so much money elsewhere !
asian	great selection of seafood : fish , squid , crab , lobster , oyster , geoduck , and shark fin . didn 't ask whether or not the shark fin was sustainable or not ... hot and sour soup was good , as well as the sizzling black pepper beef . chinese broccoli was cooked very well . very tender but not too soft . i gave two stars because i found the prices to be high and the service was intermittent . they were very attentive in the beginning and gave great recommendations ( sizzling beef and hot and sour soup ) but then were nonexistent when e tried to get more hot water for our tea .
asian	this place had most of the hotpot selections , however , the soup base was very meh ... overall this is a very , very average hot pot place . not worth your time .
asian	the food was nothing special ... i 've had tastier authentic chinese cousine . would not waste my money here again . there are better chinese restaurant on the same street that you don 't have too look far .
asian	we ordered a few appetizers , nigiri , and one roll . the appetizers like shrimp tempura and baked green mussels were good . the nigiri was terrible and the appearance was enough for me to lose my appetite . tuna was grey and looked bruised instead of bright red and octopus was too chewy . scallop nigiri was ok but unevenly seasoned , one piece would have too much salt or too much lemon . the dragon roll was average . expected more for 4 stars . we will not be returning .
asian	everything we ordered came out very salty . ( beef salad , shrimp tom yum soup , chicken satay , pad thai ) .
asian	the portions were tiny and the sushi was , well , fishy . it didn 't taste like the high quality sushi that i was expecting . plus the prices were extremely high for the quality and quantity of food received . i guess ra and kabuki are the only decent sushi restaurants in the phoenix metro area . avoid this place and go to either of those instead !
asian	wrong ! ! ! i ordered a cocktail that was 10.00 and was so small that it was gone in three sips . the california roll was just a average . the beef yakisoba was 15.00 and the beef was raw , the portion was so small it could have been on the kids menu . i was soo disappointed this was a girls weekend with my daughter and this place really sucked . ended up going back to the hotel and going to bed hungry . ruined the night . don 't ever go here , very very overpriced and terrible food ! ! ! ! !
asian	) . we were craving thai and my bf found this place via yelp . small restaurant , kind of an odd odor inside , i wasn 't sure if it was plumbing issues or chemical cleaner .. it was gross whatever it was ! service was meh , food ( salad , drunken noodles , mango sticky rice , sake ) was meh , nothing was very tasty or exciting . i mentioned i 'm vegan and yet they brought my salad out w chopped egg on top . overall a meh experience . not impressed , i won 't be returning .
asian	cold food , standoffish / slow service and overall below subpar compared to the bristol location . you 'd think better of the original than its copies but certainly not in this case . do yourselves a favour and drive over to the bristol location instead as this was a disappointment . 2 stars because i did like their popcorn chicken better and the blonde man serving us was a sweetheart , but rest assured that i will not be coming back here .
asian	no wait. ordered our food. our hot sake and beer , appetizer , and one of our entrees came out . forty minutes later , still no food . we ask our server to check up on it . he never came back . we asked another server and he took care of us . eventually we got all our food and he gave us 3 more hot sakes on the house , which made it a little better . i was super hungry to begin with , so i was not in a good mood at all and i couldn 't enjoy the sushi i ordered because i ate everything so fast . this review is based mainly on poor customer service . food was average .
asian	geez , no one bothered to greet us , seat us or act like we existed . waited long enough & finally gave up & left . take your business & eat where they welcome customers . these people could care less
asian	it 's a decent looking place though with good service .
asian	we waited a good 15 20 mins , a group of 5 came and there was a round table leaving , i understood they would want to sit a larger group 1st and i saw a booth clearing , another group of 5 came and they gave the booth ( sits 4 ) to the group of 5 and added a small table and totally ignored our group ... this is not how you do business ... will never come again ...
asian	unfortunately we seem to have come at a bad time , since the gamjatang and the soondubu that we ordered were both pretty bland . both of our soups tasted very watered down and had no flavour . the banchan on the other hand , was full of flavour and our favourite part of the meal ! probably won 't be coming back .
asian	the place was busy but we were seated within an appropriate amount of time . i ordered avocado rolls , and the rice unfortunately did not taste good , and the avocados seemed old . not really a place to go to for quality rolls . great place if you are looking for a cheap meal .
asian	the staff did not acknowledge us for a good 10 minutes while we were waiting at the door . on top of that , once we were seated , our server didn 't bother taking our orders or giving us cutlery until we had asked 3 times . the food was great but because of the craptastic service i would never come here again .
asian	located in a plaza , the restaurant is large , and as with most ayce places , offers more selection on weekends . in general , keep in mind that i am not a fan of any korean bbq restaurant ; i don 't enjoy going to a restaurant to cook my own food and leave completely smelling like bbq smoke . nonetheless , the service was attentive despite our large group , and this location always seems to be busy . i would recommend the short ribs and i love bbq pineapple .
asian	ordered the rock shrimp and brussels sprouts appetizers . both had little flavor but tasted soaked in grease ... had 2 sushi rolls which were decent but we 're more rice than anything ... maybe some of the other food they serve is ok but i was fairly disappointed especially for a place that is pricier than the average sushi place . the biggest problem was it seemed very dirty . our menu had syrupy drink splattered all over it and you could see the table was barely cleaned off . for a fairly new restaurant it looked incredibly worn . i definitely will not return .
asian	had the pork bone soup . was not that good . also looked dirty . would not come back again .
asian	the portions were tinyyyy and items were overpriced ( even for vegas ) . will not be back .
asian	restaurant was pretty quiet so that should have been a sign , right ? it was pricey and the portions were tiny ! maybe we 're just used to seattle size portions but when we got our " combo " plate of bbq meats ( duck , chicken and roast pork ) , the guys asked is that everything or is there more ? plus you have to pay extra to get the roast pork ! the house special chow mein was swimming in gravy- maybe add some more noodles to balance out all the sauce ... we will have to look a little harder for good chinese food in vegas next time !
asian	food was on the salty side . two stars because for an asian restaurants , they failed the steamed rice to me . the rice was a little dry , perhaps not enough water used to cook it .
asian	the last time i was here was over a year ago . i remember the food was ok back then . now ... its just .. below average . kind of bland . lobster was just all sauce to give it some taste . the bok choy with mushrooms ... covered with sauce ! , under the sauce .. was bland . the fried rice was bland . it felt like it was all filler food . i did eat until i was full .. but not satisfying . surprisingly its busy . would i come back here ... not likely if the food quality stays like this . hope it changes soon , cause i do like the parking - lots because its a corner restaurant .
asian	everything tastes like it had been sitting there for a long time . there wasn 't really much of a variety of food it seemed to just be the same thing repeated in different flavors . wife and i got sick that night too .
asian	not sure what happened with the service , but it really sucks . the food taste pretty good , but service was not good at all . we asked for a lemon for soju , but the lemon never arrived . the server supposed to cook our meat at our table , but they never did . we had to cook the meat ourselves . the problem is that they were not busy . my in-law commented about the service to one of the waitress and she didn 't even say she was sorry . i still tip them , but i shouldn 't have in this case .
asian	it took almost 15 minutes to get our tea , and our water never came .. the table next to us had the same situation , they ordered two pint of beer and it just sat on the bar counter for at least 10 minutes before the waitress brought it to them ! and it must have tasted flat , because they barely touched their beer when they paid and left . the food was disappointing .. fried calamari was cold and soggy , the other dishes we ordered were also lukewarm ... not going back again : (
asian	the miso soup tasted like hot water and the spicy salmon was anything but spicy . the rest of the food was ok , nothing to really complain about . i also felt slightly uncomfortable as staff were a bit standoffish . i will not be returning .
asian	worst service ever , nobody has ever refill the water . the udon was good ; however had to ask the server to check our order after waiting for 35 minutes . but after we finish with our food . they brought the check very fast . horrible experience on christmas ! ! !
asian	- food : well , it is a buffet . sushi selection was terrible and everything was obviously not fresh . hibachi steak was dry . my ice cream had freezer burn . + price : cheap for a buffet + atmosphere : typical chinese buffet layout . good for groups . - service : unprofessional . waiters yelling across the room is not very pleasant . - recommendation : nope .
asian	two stars for big portions and the fried tofu was very delicious . everything else was so mediocre i won 't even mention the names . but the deal breaker was finding a long gray hair in the stir fried veggie dish . and no one has gray hair in our group so we are positive it does not belong to any of us . gross ! ! ! does not recommend .
asian	the bartender was a total jerk . he is everything the other reviewers had to say about him . the servers were just as bad . do yourself a favor and just go to a different bar . i 'd recommend geisha a go go . the staff at geisha are at friendlier and the place is cleaner .
asian	first she explained that we got to pick between three different types of specials except what was written on the menu were not the specials they had and then after deciding which one we would get , she explains you were only able to get the special if you paid with cash. the food overall seemed very simple , some stuff we got was a little bit undercooked ( enoki mushrooms wrapped with beef ) .. just did not feel like it was worth the money we spent. i guess the prices for lunch aren 't too bad
