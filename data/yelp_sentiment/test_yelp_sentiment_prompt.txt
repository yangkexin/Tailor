1	i had two mini-margaritas , which were good . i also has the rum soaked puerco tacos . they were very good . the serving " rack " is a nice gimmick , but i 'd prefer a normal plate . the coconut flan was delicious . the service was fast and friendly from beginning to end . upon entry to the location , i could smell something very pleasant , although i could not determine the source . it was not a food type smell and was not overpowering . i 'd like to know what it is , so i can use it in my house .
1	as i made an early morning leave from phoenix we popped in here for a breakfast burrito which was amazing , and some tamales that were absolutely perfect . the big winner here though .. the homemade tortillas i purchased and took home . i can 't even begin to tell you how good they were . i even had people in la freaking out at how delicious they are and i must find out if they will ship me a bag or 2 . the place is pretty bustling in the morning and i would easily , easily go back here for more . staff is great and the food is authentic. but seriously .. buy their tortillas . i 'm not even kidding .
1	if you 're looking for a place that has great table side guacamole and awesome corn tortilla tacos this is the place . pork shoulder and mahi mahi tacos are highly recommended . staff was very attentive and the atmosphere was great . if you get a chance to eat outside in their back courtyard i would high recommend it .
1	fresh , delicious ! clean restaurant , with great salsa bar . assortment of home made agua frescas . the chicken tacos are to die for , and i loved their piña ( pineapple ) agua fresca . 5 / 5 will return for sure !
1	this has been a family favorite for a few years now , and by far , one of the best places i have ever eaten . their lengua , carne , & birria are amazing ! ! ! everything here is homemade and truly incredible . cornerstone of avondale
1	the food is great , i 've had so many of the menu items--and i 've never complained about anything . my number one favorite is the tav-a-roo tacos , but again , you can 't go wrong with anything on the menu . mix and match the tacos to try different flavors , i also recommend the baja rice for a side . they have great drink specials and a full margarita list to choose from . when you sit down , they 'll serve you chips and corn salsa ... you 're going to want more ! the servers are always great , the atmosphere is fun and laid-back . absolutely recommend it !
1	great portions and amazing flavors . the munchies appetizer was so much more than we thought ... could have been our dinner . chicharron was by far the best . coming back next monday for tacos and margaritas .
1	i did not expect there to be a mediterranean / glatt kosher restaurant in las vegas . i found this restaurant on yelp and decided to go here after reading good reviews on yelp . i ordered the jerusalem grill mix which comes with chicken kabob , chicken shawarma , and beef kabob , i also got it with couscous and a side of steak fries . tasted excellent ! my wife and friends ordered shawarma plates and they were equally good . service was friendly and prompt . it 's good to know that there is a great kosher restaurant in vegas and we will definitely be back here next time we are in vegas .
1	so authentic and so flavorful . literal chunks of pineapple . they are cutting the al pastor off the spinning rod as you walk in . it 's a little disturbing but ... welcome to the jungle . it 's so damn good i ordered more tacos after i finished my first order . in my defense , they are small . definitely check this off your list while in vegas . it 's worth it
1	halfpint is the bomb ! she gives amazing customer service and goes above and beyond any expectations ! ! our server carter was top notch and provided everything we could ask for ! great experience .
1	authentic mexican food right down to the chips and salsa ! great service , great atmosphere ! my all time favorite mexican food !
1	the customer service is truly amazing and they always make sure you are happy . the food matches the service truly amazing . glad to see we have such a rad place in las vegas like no other !
1	service was great , salsas were spicy , and the meats were flavorful . best little taco shop .
1	amazing jerk chicken that the meat slides right off the bone . rice and beans were not dry , plantains were delicious . i 'm not usually a fan of cabbage but theirs was really good .
1	prices are reasonable for the amazing product , it 's roughly equivalent to what you 're used to paying for a sushi roll wherever you 're from . also enjoyed done kimchi on the side which is fabulous , great balanced flavor . ate firecracker , catapillar and angry tuna burritos with my wife . check it out for sure whether you 're on the strip or not .
1	filled up on free chips / salsa , taking entree home for later . very delicious , the flaming fajita platter is a joy to watch .
1	i recently found out i have celiac disease and it 's tough finding a place to eat with many different options and still taste amazing ! i saw they had so many 5 stars i though i 'd give it a try , and they were right ! pancho 's has a whole separate menu for vegan only ! how cool ? ? and all their corn tortillas are gluten-free ! ! not to mention the ladies up front we 're really nice and patient ! i would definitely recommend this place to everyone i know trying to eat healthy !
1	i ordered 3 carne asada tacos and my friend ordered a carne asada burrito . the meals came with a box of cabbage , cucumber , lime , and pico . there was also a separate side of grilled onions . everything was fantastic . but they don 't serve guacamole .... weird . no bueno . everything else was amazing . can 't tell from the outside , but definitely at least drive thru
1	lots of fish ( fish was grilled - not battered ) added with lettuce , tomatoes & cilantro ... yum ! ! and with the salsas ... omg ! ! good ! ! they have this orange-red salsa ... i think it 's habanero with chile d arbol . that salsa alone will make u want to go back ! spicy ! ! definitely going back ! ! happy i work near by ! ! : )
1	when i arrived there was nobody in the outer courtyard , even with the misting vents going full blast , but the tiny interior was hopping . i sat at the bar and had a mango mojito and the special , a delicious seafood enchilada with scallops and crab . food aside , this place has a 5-star vibe . there were young groups , older groups , couples on dates , businessmen , the whole range in this place . it felt like eating at a your friendly neighborhood eatery but with hipper decor and enthusiastic , attentive staff .
1	super quick with great customer service . overall it 's a happy experience .
1	the food was very good and inexpensive and the delivery was spot on to the estimated time they email you .
1	get the asuuuh delude . excellent staff . authentic mexico music . also has a jukebox
1	best service ! ! ! the best steak and chimichurri i have ever had ! the cut their own fries nothing frozen , and the they have so many sauces for everything ! ! the lamb burger is sick ! ! ! and the chicken skewers are the perfect marinate ! ! beautiful atmosphere very modern ! ! !
1	i try to get tacos from them every week in braddock . never had a bad taco ever . worth every penny
1	i had the machaca plate and it was the perfect mixture of egg , beef and veggies . thankfully no tomatoes ! my sons quesadilla was cheesy without being greasy . my other son had rolled tacos . with the exception of the poisonous guacamole ; ) he ate all three . i sacrificed and scraped guac off and ate it with my plate . the mrs. had the carne asada salad and liked it . well done , ricardo 's ! we liked the hot and mild salsa . not a fan of the medium . i just like a sweeter salsa .
1	10 times better than i remember , very fresh food and efficient workers , if u gave this location a bad review in the past i recommend to try them again they recently remodeled the interior too with very comfy chairs and nice paint !
1	the food is always hot and made right . the employees are friendly too .
1	kids now grown and having been to many other mexican eateries we ended up back here tonight . we were surprised and impressed by the nature and quality of the menu . the food was delicious , the chicken taco special with black beans and grilled vegetables was excellent . the beef and chorizo quesadillas were also excellent . the guacamole was fresh and tasty . the staff were genuinely friendly and interested in making our experience enjoyable . we will plan on returning much sooner ! ! !
1	bakersfield is the first mexican restaurant i 've wanted to come back to ( outside of ca ) . the space and the vibe is cool , the tacos are great with more a fresh mex feel ( no beans and rice or tons of cheese ) , guac is good . the red sangria is some of the best i 've had . it 's wine and fruit with minimal sugary stuff added . i will definitely be back soon !
1	6 : 30 pm party of two , decided we should support the local community restaurant . lina 's we immediately were greeted by the owner , seated and started with drinks , and quesadilla appetizer . it was delivered hot , with all the proper sauces . the guacamole is excellent . we order two combination dinners that were hot , delicious , and very filling . all food is prepared and made fresh including the floor tortillas . the prices were very inline with economy . the owner answered all our questions , and the service was 5 star .
1	don 't judge me , it is over a 7 year period of time . yes , i have forgotten to check in a few times . no , i don 't understand why i am not the duke . ( geeez yelp ! ) jk . i know it is based on frequency and recency as well : ) i love chipotle for its fast easy vegan options . also i love that viral youtube video where that kid is making fun of girls that say " i love chiiipoooltleee "
1	authentic , cheap , and crowded ! i might try the seafood soup next time . this will be my go-to down home authentic mexican spot moving forward .
1	very authentic . i 've lived in mexico personally and have to insist this is a hidden gem . family run . nice laid back attitude that makes you feel you just walked into a relative 's home , they made you feel welcome then served you some great food . at one point the cook poked her head out of the kitchen and asked how we liked the food . we will definitely be back . it 's a shame more businesses aren 't as welcoming . definitely recommend this place
1	typical busy hour , quick , grab and go . ordered beef cheddar crunch-wrap slider , and mango fiesta . it was hot , crunchy and delicious . i don 't really know how people think about taco bell , but with staff like robert , i had better understanding how important to show our friendliness to our guest is matter . this location is the best in las vegas area by far . thank you for the all staff and robert , keep it up and god job !
1	i 've had 100 's of burritos . i make my own chorizo at home . these guys nailed it . everything is exactly as it is supposed to be for a pure , simple and classic breakfast burrito . and out the door for less than $ 5.00 ! ! !
1	best deal ever ! will come back to try the food and salsa bar looks delicious .
1	a couple cold coronas and it don 't get much better for the price . i 'm definitely a fan .
1	the pork taco is phenomenal ! try the chipotle salsa and chimichurri salsa . hand crafted with care . beyond amazing . cindi ( and all the servers ) are an absolute delight . always warm , friendly and accommodating !

1	best horchata in the us . 2. great service , i 'd go back just for the smiling faces . 3. with all that good stuff to say , even better food . we got an assortment . everything was delicious. thank you .
1	it 's the spot to go that day . the burritos are huge and for only one buck ? you really cant go wrong . they have other cool deals throughout the week but that 's my favorite . good food at really great prices ! if you 're in the mood for mexican this spot is way better and more authenic than taco bell ! worth a try . get the green hot sauce . their red sauce is no good . they have a drive thru and are open late !
1	hola ! ! best street corn and tacos al pastor in town ! ! ! great service and delicious food .
1	staff is always so welcoming and open to accommodating your meal to your liking . i bring my girlfriend here whenever we are craving peruvian cuisine . definitely recommend the ceviche mixto and the lomo saltado . you have to try the inca cola with your meal . the ultimate meal is the seafood platter sufficient for two . i have tried every peruvian restaurant in lv and this is my favorite ! the owner is very humble and respectful .
1	me and my boyfriend eat there every week and we love it ! the salsa is homemade and they have 4 different kinds . the chunky hot is delicious ! you can even buy pints of the salsa and take it to go ! the huevos rancheros are the best i have ever had ! ! if your looking for good mexican food this never disappoints .

1	1 star for huge margaritas 1 star for inflatable palm trees 1 star for beachy music playing 1 star for nice , attentive , unpretentious bartenders 1 star for patrons wearing hawaiian shirts ... in wisconsin .
1	fast great food ! ! huge portions and good w pricing . free condiments . drive thu and also open 24hours
1	every thing was great . you 'd think you were in cancun . great seafood . my husband had the snapper . amazing ! then the show started ! ! !
1	you can get endless bowles of bead dip and salsa w / chips for just ordering a margarita . after ordering the fajitas a few times , i switched to the pollo special on the specials menu . it comes with tortillas and happens to be a better flavor recipe than the fajitas . the fried ice cream is delicious too . its a great place for groups and parties .
1	( also half off the bill on mondays for locals ! ) they offer carne asada , carnitas , al pastor , cochinita , and pulled chicken tacos . for a dollar , they don 't even skimp on the quantity nor quality of ingredients . that warrants five stars on its own , but the service was great too . our server , neil , was really accommodating and chef paco personally delivered our tacos to us . we also ordered guac , empanadas , churros , and flan . the desserts were freaking amazing . best flan i 've ever had . chef paco even brought us an additional complimentary flan / cake . : )
1	i started with them back at u of illinois in the 80 's and the still deliver a great filling burrito as big as your head . good stuff , wish i had one in chapel hill .
1	absolutely fabulous . great flavor in every bite . friendly staff and pisco ! ! ! !

1	everything is fresh . i love the food it has flavor . my dad had the tacos . i had the huevos-rancheros . service was excellent . friendly and clean atmosphere . i recommend this resturant to anyone lookin for good food fast service ! !
1	we had lunch and loved it . the shrimp fajitas were excellent , enough for two . too bad we had to drive 45 miles in the crazy valley traffic ! !
1	went last night and we each had a different nacho selection . they were great . the cheeseburger and bacon nachos had just the perfect amount of cheese and the crumbled bacon on top was a great touch . the menu is huge but just go in and open a page and point and i am sure you will enjoy your selection as much as we did . drinks were great but maybe a locals discount to bring down the cost just a little bit would be even better . the service was excellent and the pink / white corn chips were a nice touch for cancer awareness month . i will be back , defiantly , very soon . yummmmmmm
1	flan for dessert is a must . chef paco thank you for delivering the dessert . nice touch to an amazing meal .
1	good service , even better food , very authentic . i 'll be back .
1	we had puerco y carne asada and they were both great . salsas especially the white one were really good . we had the grilled chicks also . it was good but was not right off the grill so it could have been better fresh . will come back next time in town .
1	excellent food . our server was casey ( chandler location manager ) , she is warm , friendly and very enjoyable to talk to . we will definitely be back again , soon ! may even go out to chandler to see her again : )
1	that means bottomless tacos and margaritas for $ 25 . the interior is very nice and they have outside seating . the hostess looks like a supermodel . fun times .
1	she also insisted on getting their " house " dressing . the slight saltiness of the cheese , with the ranch-like flavor of their " house " dressing along with the sweet bbq sauce of the barbacoa were a powerful group of flavors that are worth coming back for !
1	went for happy hour , runs until 8pm which is great . food and service were very good . we had skinny margaritas , grilled beef tacos and grilled beef tacos . rice and refried beans were very good as well . server , liz , was very nice and food was delivered very quickly .

1	who is really joyful / friendly . amazing customer service . highly recommended .
1	had the fish tacos with no bean paste on tortilla have to say one of the best places for fish tacos . cute little restaurant . will definitely go back .

1	the passion fruit dressing was to die for . i had the cubano sandwich and wife had a fried plantain sandwich . the beef and veg soup was so good with the cilantro they put in . coming back for sure ! !
1	small .. but there food is outstanding ! ! ! ! ! ! ! we ordered a carne asada burro with red sauce . my wife ordered menudo , cheese quesadilla , the cheese just dripped once we were eating it . lol . everything came our fast and hot . they kindly gave us a small patch of carne asada for my kid .. everything is around $ 10 . are new place . come check it out ..

1	this has got to be the cleanest restaurant that i have dined in in a very looooong time . it was spotless , i mean perfect , like they just opened for the 1st day . i am a clean freak especially in restaurants , and i am beyond impressed . but my gratitude doesn 't stop there , the ladies at the counter were super sweet , friendly and helpful . we dined at 10 : 30am and the restaurant was pretty quiet . the staff stayed busy cleaning and stocking . very hard workers . our food was hot , fresh , and sooo good . this isn 't near our home , however will definitely come back . yummy ! ! ! !
1	tasted just like other location . best grilled chicken tacos on grilled corn tortillas . they had pico de gallo and guacamole with lime and your choice of red or green salsa . these are my favorite taco and all locations make exactly the same . delicious .
1	we ordered the green chilaquiles , pazole and chorizo burrito , all were great ! this could be our new spot for breakfast before sunday football !
1	most everything ( even rice and beans ) is home made . loved it !
1	group of 7-we were treated to outstanding service , delicious and fresh unlimited salads , veggies and other sides . loved the table side plantains ! yummy . and of course the meat . wow , once you turn over your card from red to green the gauchos begin rounding the table with pork , lamb , steak , chicken , and sausage . wow . my favorite was the filet minion . as part of the price fixe service we were also treated to a free dessert . for meat lovers and low carb fanatics , this place is a must .
1	atmosphere is loud . food is delicious . - my friend had the corn which looked amazing and tastes really good . - i had the fish cod tacos : so delicious ! price is the usual / same as everywhere else for smaller meals . 2nd time tried to go around 8-9pm ( during tiff ) and there was an hr wait so we didn 't go . i would definitely recommend going .
1	5 rolled tacos for me and carne asada burrito for daddy . everything perfect just like national city where daddy came from . crunchyroll tacos with guacamole perfect . and daddy was happy because he ate the whole burrito and no mystery meat sometimes he spits out and throws the burrito away not this time . and the salsa verde was not too hot just right .
1	made to order breakfast burrito with loads of sausage and eggs . i liked the light green sauce at the salsa bar on it . great burrito wrap . i will be back to try the tacos .
1	chill and fun environment and the menu had a wide selection of authentic food ! it 's a must . not much of a tequila fan but the gm ramon knows his products . everything from the fresh guac made at your table and dessert is to die for .
1	i had the grande burrito and my husband had 3 enchiladas - carnitas , shredded beef and chicken - came with beans and rice . plenty of food and reasonable price . server was great - attentive without hovering . my glass was always refilled before i had finished it . brought us additional chips and salsa - again without asking . all in all a wonderful visit - will return soon : - )
1	love the carne asada . my husband and in-laws are mexican and i grew up in socal . sometimes there is a bit of a wait but there is usually only one person working , maybe two if it is a weekend . definitely our go-to place for mexican food here !
1	found a hightop table during happy hour before it started to pick up . the general dining area was about full except for about 3 or 4 larger tables . our waiter was easily the most pleasant one i 've had since i could remember and the tacos were amazing ! free chips and salsa are always a bonus . mondays $ 3 margaritas are a crowd pleaser too . patron is the place to be for tacos on mondays !
1	is it fancy ? no , but the tacos are excellent . these are awesome little carne asada tacos with cilantro and onions . it 's a food truck in the parking lot of a car wash . they grill whole chickens in the parking lot and you can get one for $ 10 for 12 pieces of chicken . there 's a tv hooked up in front of the food truck and on most given nights it 's playing soccer . the tacos are tasty , fresh to order and cheap . seating consists of 4 folding chairs in the parking lot while you wait to take your tacos home .
1	the tacos are absolutely delicious and the salsa bar is fantastic . we 've found our new tuesday spot !
1	oh wait , it 's tuesday ! i think i know what i 'm having for lunch .
1	who can beat that ? ! not even tacos mexico across the street , not only are the tacos cheap but they are deliciosos ! ! ! also , they are the only ones , pretty much , that serve tacos de pollo ( my favorite ) . the salsas are uncovered , but who cares they 're good ! ! ! the staff is always friendly and funny to talk to . make sure to bring your piggy banks , cash only .
1	i live in an area full of your typical everyday fast food chains and its truly a breathe of fresh air when i have sabor to eat at . healthy opinions of great quilty food which i 'm searching for right after working out . i would like to put some art in this restaurant . # saborislife
1	everyone please go the food is delicious and they have different deals every day . the salsa bar is also a must try they even have pineapple habenero .
1	the tomatillo red is the absolute best . i could eat it on anything . 2 . they have a great app for your phone . it stores your favorite order , your card # ( if you want ) , and you just click , send the order , walk in , laugh at everyone waiting in line , and get your food .
1	2-very well priced , you 'll end up trying very different things . 3-my favorite , arepa de pabellón . reminds me of my budare arepas in caracas 3- truly an authentic experience . come try it !
1	wait until you are very hungry . 2 . go to cacique grill and order their passion fruit pulled pork sandwich for under $ 10 . 3 . enjoy the wonderfully messy , incredibly satisfying , juicy pulled pork , infused with a slightly tangy ( not spicy ) marinade , garlic mayo , and tomatoes on a kaiser-roll style bun ( without poppy seeds ) . also their aioli for dipping the fries into was stupendous ! 4 . if satisfied with these instructions , pass them on to a friend .
1	food was so good ! i had the chicken enchilada & chicken taco lunch combination & i couldve licked the plate lol not really but sooooo good !
1	i seem to like it more , the more i eat here . everything is freshly prepared and there 's a lot of variety for a small hole in the wall . there are 5-6 salsas to go with the chips they give with every order or to use on the burrito . one time they were out of my favorite sauce and i asked if they had more in the back . the guy behind the counter said he 'd make some more . about 5 minutes later he came out with a freshly blended batch ... it was amazing as always . $ 7.50 will buy you a burrito , and it 's worth every penny .
1	not to mention the enthusiastic owner greeting you in the front . and the endless supply of chips and salsa . great place and great employees . we weren 't even done with our bowl of chips and elvia ( a busser i believe ) kept bringing a new bowl . fred , our server , was friendly and quick . didn 't try the food , but our experience here was fantastic ! i can see why this place has been in business for over 30 years .
1	the mission is always a definite go ... like go giants ! still o-sooo-good . i 've included their pozole in my faves . added another star to my earlier review !
1	two of us were very full and food was yummy . great service in a fast food like setting . had no room for any bakery items but they smelled delicious . recommend .
1	love it ! they do not skimp at all on goodies or the tuna . i am very full after eating the 6 " shorty .
1	breakfast burittos , carne asada burritos , chimichangas , rolled tacos , & the horchata are all delish ! i can 't wait to try the rest of the menu .
1	we had the tacos , some burritos and a torta and they all tasted great . definitely recommend the place
1	perfect place to stop and eat for any night owls out there ! the food is really good . from the goat cheese pizza to the duck tacos to the chili to the hummus and pita . we 've been making 3 , 4 , 5am stops here for years and the place has yet to disappoint ! !
1	no dairy but i don 't miss it . grab a jarittos in the market and walk over to schenley plaza for a great pgh lunch .
1	always great food , especially when no one else will serve you until that late . an industry standard for scottsdale .
1	so good ! i was questioning this place at first , admittedly judging a book by its cover . but such a great little find .
1	, not to mention some of the best authentic homemade mexican cuisine .
1	omg ! ! ! awesome . the two catfish burritos are surprisingly different . with the fried fish you can really taste the deep , complex flavors of the rice and beans . with the grilled fish , the blackened catfish flavor really steps up to the front . either way , this is the best cajun food i 've had--i 'm no expert though--my taste buds were in love .
1	guacamole , salsa and thin crispy tortilla chips included as an appetizer . honey chipotle crispers and margarita chicken are yummy . they sealed the deal with coke zero ! big portions . amazing staff ( shout out to the wonderful cameo ! ) . we love this chili 's and travel out of our way to come here because the amazing ms. cameo makes us feel so very special . the food is always good . this chili 's has erased our ugly memories of apple-somethings .
1	banging tacos ! i really like the serve yourself taco sauces . almost every time i 'm in the strip district .
1	it was worth it ! the highlight was the chicken skin nachos . we all know the best park of fried chicken is the skin , so they just took the skin and made nachos . the most gluttonous glorious dish ever . i don 't think i will order them again , but they were certainly an experience . oh , and we sat at the bar right in front of the dj , so much fun !
1	they 're not mini at all , and so delicious !
1	they 're still certainly really really good without a doubt , just the place that 's # 1 is really really really good and has the advantage of being a full-size restaurant ) . -they 're open 24 hours . -their stand / tent is really nice . it even has tvs so you can watch espn or other sports . -prices are fair , especially for how good their food is . -the guys who run it were nice and cool too . overall , it is everything you could want in a taco stand and a pretty easy and well deserved 5-stars .
1	: ) i didn 't know this 2nd location opened until i ran into it a couple weeks ago . just ate there today and the service is friendly as usual , food is great , as usual ! had the street tacos , a fish , shrimp and carne , they were great . carne asada quesadilla was great , my husband had the al pastor burrito and loved it . margaritas were great too , we 'll be back soon !
1	the closest street tacos mexican style ish you 'll find in phoenix . bomb.com ! ! ! i come outta my way to eat here . highly recommend . and there 's a guy who sells illegal dvds of movies that are in the theaters now ... can 't get any better than that ...
1	side of tostones and the pork . first time i had the cuban sandwich .
1	chips and salsa are really good . the shredded beef they use in tacos and the burrito ranchero is really good . it 's priced a little higher than most but you 're in summerlin , not the " historic district . "
1	small dog friendly , possibly any size dog friendly with patio seating
1	had lunch today . corn on the cob appetizer is messy , but unbelievably good . tacos are fun and different . i like some of them more than others . you 've got to be willing to try new stuff . atmosphere is unique . old church - stained glass . open environment . can be a bit noisy . everyone seems to be having fun here . looks like a great happy hour place . not convenient for me , but i will return when in this area ... maybe even wheni 'm not in the area .
1	2nd time here in a week the chencho fries & a double cheese burger ! ! ! !
1	awesome salsa and filet nachos ! house margs are great and if you check in via yelp at certain times you get a free one ! service can 't be beat !
1	we need to come more often . we had the beef tacos this time . they are hands down the best we 've ever had . nice folks too !
1	we are not vegetarian or vegan and we live to come here it 's quite refreshing and relaxing . i highly recommend stopping in for a bite they also have live music on friday and saturday nights , come and enjoy
1	the shop itself is tucked in by the home depot , i highly recommend trying this robertos next time you are in the area . i will be back to this one every tom i need a tool from home depot
1	our visit this time was just short of fantastic . our server , enrique was great , attentive & professional . i had the chilaquiles , which was amazing ! and , to top it off , i had the flan to rule all flans for desert ! it is a must try .... even if full after dinner ! a much , much better experience this time vs. my 1st visit .
1	beyond good . i will get some pics of the bar etc .
1	happy hour was great , 3p-7p , and the tacos here are great as well . we had the tecate fish & carnitas tacos , and loved them both . also enjoyed the fresh guac !
1	the mexican shrimp cocktail is packed with big fat fresh shrimp , almost like a ceviche , but very good . i ordered just regular fish tacos and they were delicious , i loved the rice , just perfect and our waitress was sweet and attentive . met one of the owners while there , nice guy and excited that we were excited ! i don 't know why anyone would give this place one star , but everything was great ! others in my group had the ahi tacos and clam chowder and loved them both .
1	took my whole family this time . everyone like it . i had a chimichanga style el pastor burrito . comes with.sour cream and guac . they even have me a free taco to try el pastor to see if i 'd like it . chops and salsa have improved . perfect heat . chile relano was tasty also . will go back again and again .
1	2nd time we ate here in 2 days. just moved from san antonio and we missed mexican food. great service and awesome food both days .
1	never busy , at night during the week when we go . the owner , in the cowboy hat does it all ! we always start with the margaritas , mango & cactus . drink 2 glasses and you will be feeling great ! haha . food is always fresh and very tasty ! i had the chicken quesadilla which is the best i 've ever had at any mexican / latin restaurant ! before we leave we always stay a few minutes longer chatting with the owner . he is looking for good , reliable help if anyone is interested .
1	wow even better . it was early saturday morning after i finished a project in the neighborhood so i found myself all alone in the place . greeted right away . had my favorite huevos this time with chorizo . wow spicy good enjoyed every bite . still have a the navajo taco on my bucket list . maybe tonight . greatest green chili in the valley hands down !
1	first visit we had a half roasted chicken and peruvian paella , this visit we had the catapulcra ( delicious ! ) and the lomo saltado de pollo ( so amazing i want to eat it every day ) . both trips we walked out with plenty of leftovers and a comparatively small dent in our wallet . i can 't recommend this place enough . so good ! !
1	it is our special place ! love the atmosphere and the food is the best ! !
1	made us come back and equally as a excellent experience ... food excellent service even better
1	helps a lot that the staff was really friendly and measures were implemented to customize our order while we waited for it to cook . shorter wait time and of course the food was delish . my husband is a huge fan of some of the more authentic mexican options like al pastor and cotija cheese .
1	really friendly folks working here . the 4 for 4 combo deal is absolutely unbeatable . lol , the catsup dispenser is not working and wasn 't working last week either ! great service overall . i wish they would add the green burrito part of the karcher franchise .
1	$ 2 shots , $ 2 tacos , $ 2 beers , $ 2 ' ritas ? we had so much fun. and it kept us closer to our budget than any of the other joints in town .......... hint : if service seems slow , go sit at the bar .
1	chicken tinga tacos are soooo yummy and the staff is always friendly i love joyride
1	they fill me up , and the condiments / toppings that they have on the side are awesome. plus the people who work there are so friendly ! i love supporting this small local business .
1	can 't beat the price , great service , seated and served quickly . food is pretty good , no complaints - 2 people , ( 5 ) tacos , 2 cokes , free refills , chips & salsa $ 20 with tip
1	since we were staying at bally 's , we stopped here several times throughout the week . friendly service , good drinks and decent food each time we went . the tacos were actually delicious , and the queso fundido dip is great as well ( don 't worry , i ate them while sober once- they 're actually good ! granted , even better when drunk ) .
1	sabor passed both ! what a great little place ! my husband and i take a lot of trips to mexico and the caribbean so love the chill street food atmosphere . only wish there were some outside seating so we could hang out all day . will totally return
1	great service n sumptuous food all the time ! ! fajita is my favorite ! will definately come back again soon !
1	ask for tommy " superman " the server ! he definitely made our experience worth it !
1	truly one of the best things i have ever eaten ! if i had to choose a last meal , la cave 's beef carpaccio would be part of it for sure ! the amazing flavor of the beef , the truffle aioli , capers , arugula ... orgasmic ! the restaurant itself is so chic and funky ... such a contrast to all the slots and table games . i love the atmosphere and every single thing i have eaten here has been on point . i would also recommend the salt roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachios ... heavenly !
1	holy moly i wish i had endless bottles of this stuff ! i have loved this place since it first opened ! i only go to the lakewood location and i am so happy that they have been successful enough to make the place larger as well as open a second location ! the food here is bomb diggity ! i have no words to describe how in love i am with the food . no matter how many times i visit each dish i order is as good as the next ! if you have never been ... shame on you ! get in your car and go now !
1	pastor volcan . every time , all the time . location is great as well since six pack & arc are right down the street , so it becomes a great post-workout meal . chips are included , salsa is included if you 're eating in ( one is a a generic mild tomato salsa , the other a spicier orange salsa ... i want to say habanero-based but it 's not quite as spicy as habanero would be . but really , get that pastor volcan . it will blow your mind for under $ 3 .
1	it is becoming our family thing on tuesdays . very good tacos and the tortillas are heavenly ! !
1	albert was our server and took care of us as he always does . he 's very attentive and on point when making suggestions . tacos were amazing , and the flan was no different .
1	keep up the awesome work and the high fives when i come thru ! !
1	short rib taco was the best . great service sitting at the bar . i would come back with friends and just order a bunch of food for the whole table .
1	the carnitas are bomb . the super chicken nachos are the best in town . this is my go to spot for great , fast , cheap mexican food .
1	the side condiments compliment the tacos perfectly . would highly recommend to any taco lovers in the valley to try once . you will be hooked ! lunch time is packed , so order ahead or go in after
1	the mando was a meat extravaganza , and my veggie version--potato , egg , and cheese--was huge and delicious . definitely a keeper .
1	so tasty and decadent i get the steak burrito and it is to die for but not going to lie it isnt expensive but it can be a little pricey but you do receive a lot of food and your burrito is filled well . the seasoning they use is exquisite and really fills you up .
1	it was our first time at otb and the food was excellent .. staff was very friendly from the moment we came in and you get large portions for the money .. the reason i gave the 5th star is because we had a server named john which was outstanding .. he literally would walk fast / run to the back .. when you can show customers that you will hustle that means a lot to me .. go john d .
1	the host / serving staff was friendly efficient to take our order and seat us . the kitchen staff was extremely knowledgeable when we asked about different dishes . i had the argentino salad with steak , medium rare and it was prepared to perfection ! the 4 different sauces they offer are all equally delicious and different ! the inside is clean , decorated well , and we love the yinzer vibe in there in addition to the authentic argentine feel . 5 stars and more ! love everything !
1	of his own free will , he brought out water for my pup , and consistently checked up on us . service was fast , food was incredible ( and i 'm particularly picky with my tacos ) , great prices and cheap deals , and overall an enjoyable experience . frozen strawberry margarita was perfect ( not too sweet , not too watery ) . new fav local spot for a quick , cheap meal / drink .
1	best mexican food place i 've tried in the phoenix area so far . couldn 't find anything that could replace the southern new mexico that i 'm used to
1	chips and salsa - great too ! ! chill atmosphere . first friday there is extremely fun !
1	so tender and flavorful .. large portions too ! friendly staff as well .
1	the carne asada is special ( cooked over mesquite ) and the service was really friendly and clearly valued the business . i worked in a corner for a few hours and there was a steady stream of regulars and newcomers coming in . good vibe , food , and value .
1	service & food is great ! i would recommend this place . best mexican food i 've had in the las vegas area .
1	best street tacos ever 10 carne asada 4 tripas & of course al pastor fries
1	the bbq mahi tacos are a must have . a constantly changing specials menu , great craft beer selection with a few local brewerys on tap .
1	ordered almost the entire menu and loves everything . lamb meatballs and stuffed dates are off the charts .
1	the food and service have been amazing all three times ! must try the place . beautiful atmosphere . quaint bar area . drink specials !
1	ridiculously good . good value too . ceviche and enchiladas . excellent !
1	get some alpastor and marinated chicken. best ive had in a long time . deep fried ice cream was yummy . need flan on the menu and i 'd find a way to leave a 6th star .
1	get the carnitas . you won 't regret it .
1	3 tacos for 5 bucks is a good deal and you get plenty of meat and they are delicious !
1	great value for the money . good healthy food for cheap prices . they give you the tacos ( steak or chicken ) and you put on the fixings ( pico de gallo , cabbage , lemon , hot sauce ) . 2 tacos were all i needed to fill me up . that 's with all the fixings of course . too bad they don 't have one close by me . would eat here constantly .
1	non place to sit so we sat on the curb across the street in the sun . great spot for a quick snack or lunch .
1	everything is delicious . we ate like true texans . family of 7 ate for $ 90 which is a great deal when ordering food delivery . i love texmex but whatever they call this type of mexican food is so delicious . recommend to anyone who are tired , or tired of room service to try out this restaurant . food portions are big and lots of left overs . will order tomorrow just to make sure i get everything out of vegas that i was looking to buy and eat ! !
1	if this truck is with in your reach don 't miss out ! my husband loves both their green chili burger and the bbq burger as well ! good stuff
1	what a breath of fresh air in the solon area . i felt like i was in vegas again . the place looked cool , the people looked hot , and the food was fantastic !
1	quinoa stuffed avocado . + 2 words . add chicken . back to 3 words . so dang good ! bunch of words . i hereby give my confirmation of the recommendation of this dish . i loved it . just the right amount of everything in this to-go bowl type rectangular container . their chicken is rotisserie good . tried cilantro rice ( pilaf ) & plantains both tasty .
1	a big delicious cheese burger for under $ 5 , wow ! friendly and fast employees and probably the cleanest fast food chain .
1	good food , moderate prices , excellent service . if they have seating available on their patio and the weather is cooperating , do it .
1	# 10 carnitas plate mmmmm carne asada taco mmmmm fresh and fast food !
1	service was decent as well . i can 't wait to come back . very clean and simple restaurant and menu .
1	one of the main reason we came here is that one of our friends is a vegan , and they have food she could actually eat . i had a good experience with their food at motley brews last year , so i knew they would not disappoint . we ordered our food , i got the enchilada plate , and it was perfect . no complaints , and what was awesome was that the staff is really fast and attentive . i will always come back here when i need a mexican food fix on fremont
1	don tortaco to the rescue ! 24 hour authentic , hot mexican food that doesn 't break the bank . it was amazing and this location has a drive thru ! ! we crawled into bed with full bellies this morning . i will most definitely be going back here .
1	including nyc and europe . great atmosphere , location , music , staff . nothing lacking here , except maybe more parking spots . a great find in the land of corporate dining . and those mentioning all the fake boobies and k-fed lookalikes ... hello ! this is vegas , they 're everywhere ! ! ! and tapas is about little dishes to talk over and socialize over . it doesn 't have to stick to traditional spanish ingredients .
1	this means they are not playing with the ingredients and preparation . paella negra . this was unforgettable . the pieces of squid and shrimps were super fresh with the saffron rice rissoto . how i love squid ink with anything and so this dish was a winner . ceviche with taro chips . anything with taro , i 'd die . i never knew it could be a perfect combo , it was so refreshing . i enjoyed the food with my sangria . btw , the visit was unplanned and the people around me appeared to be very satisfied . overall , it is a must -try restaurant when in aria .
1	this particular location of this strip mall has had businesses come and go too often too much . this los taquitos offers fresh yummy food with very reasonable price . the decor is cute and it is clean . we ( 4 of us ) all loved our street tacos . everything tasted fresh and clean .
1	my favorite thing on the menu * grilled street corn : bueno , but not quite as good as the street grilled variety in mexico * lamb rib appetizer- fatty and not too much meat ... but the good bits we 're awesome ! * mahi mahi tacos- decent , but save the fish tacos for another time and place ! * espresso churros & milkshake- a tasty and fun dessert ... couldn 't taste the espresso , but it was fun to dip those crunchy morsels ! our server was also very knowledgeable - will definitely be returning to the mission !
1	we had the brunch buffet ( with bottomless mimosas ! ! ! ) for only $ 14.99 . best deal ever ! we didn 't eat thattt much but we got our money 's worth with the mimosas . servers were friendly and definitely didn 't hold back on the champagne ! we 're here for a few weeks for baseball , and we will definitely be back !
1	this is basically brunch with a mexican twist . i ordered the huevos rancheros and loved it - may even be one of my favourite brunch meals ever ! the guacomole was amazing . i tried my friend 's vegetarian quesadilla and it was ok . it was actually more like empanadas so my friend expecting a typical quesadilla was disappointed . the salsa that accompanied it though was really tasty . will definitely visit again !
1	if you 're hungry , get ready to pay an extra dollar or two but then again it 's worth it . your favorite burger at home is likely almost as good as the one you 'll get at this place . and if you 're lucky enough to get a seat at the bar , you 'll be lucky enough to meet an award winning las vegas bartender . just be sure to say please and thank you !
1	what 's not to love ? obviously others agree , because this spot has a steady stream of business despite being tucked away inside the sinclair gas station convenience store . don 't let the location and lack of an outside sign deter you : you want to eat here !
1	you know what you 're getting yourself into when you come to this place . i did , at least . super burrito provides cheap food in obscene quantities to dudes on their lunch , people looking to sop up booze at midnight , and people who love to watch spanish soap operas on a 10 inch flat screen . i love super burrito .
1	best authentic mexican food i have ever eaten . i 'll probably visit az again just to get some more food .
1	there . i said it . the margaritas are bomb .
1	* * i recommend not driving away from the pay window drive through even when there is a car behind you , because that will result in you walking in and embarrassing yourself .... ^ ^ ^ not that that happened to me ... speaking for a friend . in all seriousness , this place is 24h drive through , so fast , and their carne asada burrito ( $ 7 ) is more than just decent ! ! ! ( i speak as someone from socal ) . will definitely be back !
1	my oldest daughter has been telling us about it for a while and she was right , it 's the best ! only got a picture of the blt quesadilla but we also enjoyed a carne asada & regular one . thank you joseph for the recommendations and antonia for cooking up some delicious grub ! blt quesadilla ! omg i thought a blt in between 2 slices of bread was amazing until i had it in a folded tortilla all nice and buttery crispiness ! can 't wait until we meet again
1	" 5stars for the fish tacos . bottom _ _ best i have ever tasted ... if i taste better i 'll make sure kick my self in disbelief . nuff said , r \ _
1	food is great , nice portions at very reasonable prices ! i 've been getting their shredded beef chimichanga lately , pretty good . i tried the chilaquiles they were good , came with rice and beans , and eggs were fried just how i like them ! the green sauce i thought was a bit spicy , next time i will try the chilaquiles with the red sauce instead . forgot to mention the breakfast burritos are massive ! chorizo is the best .
1	shrimp was a bit off tonight ... but maybe it was just tonight . outside of that ... great staff great food great ambience ! ! !
1	great service too ! ! and no extra charge for guacamole : ) my kids love it !
1	let me start by saying that i am a fan of taco bell . now that i have qualified this , baja fresh has the bell ( yes i have had the new taco doritos loco , big fan ) beat by a mile for what it is . at this particular location the staff is great . sign up on the web for a free burrito on your birthday ! yes i said free ( did i stutter ? ) . tell them the duke sent you . live it up , you are in las vegas for cryin ' out loud !
1	tasty , fresh , homemade , friendly . no-brainer .
1	came from san jose , ca to vegas and when we come back were definitely coming back here . i tried the outlaw burger and my husband the biggin daddy sando .
1	not to mention alcohol , beers , margaritas . vegetarian / vegan friendly . perfect and filling ! ! !
1	very cool place with a nice vibe . busy place with delicious food .
1	it 's a deal . i love the lunch special for $ 5.99 with a free 20oz soda . well i still continue to like this place . the food is amazing and the service is great ! finger licking deliciousness !
1	great service , delicious fresh food ; we think the owner came to check on us ( he didn 't introduce himself but that would 've been nice ) . will definitely go back .
1	say what ? ! the tacos were crunchy and the guac was pretty darn good ! the red salsa surprisingly was really good and didn 't have the watered down taste like other mexican fast food places . the drive thru was poppin since it was lunch time . the horchata was the best and again didn 't taste watered down . my mom had a carne asada torta and omg was the meat good . it was so tasty and well seasoned ! so happy i tried this place out and stopped by because the food was worth it !
1	at $ 2.25 each you can 't beat that price for the explosion of taste at just one bite of this pork-filled yummy goodness on your tongue ! great for after party , late night , club food ! the sauce is all the wonder ; spicy , creamy , and tastey ! who needs to go south of the border when it can come to vegas ! even better , there are two locations of your choosing ! i have visited both and can firmly account for both ! same fine taste , same bountiful servings , and same great experience ! take everything adobada style , it is their trademark and you just can 't go wrong with that !
1	we had the elote as an appetizer and it was really good . the house margarita was really tasty ! i had the enchiladas suizas and they were finger-licking good ! ! ! and the flan ... o m g ! ! ! ! hands-down to the chef ! ! i will definetely go back without a question
1	1st time to any zabas and i got a free menu item in the mail so it was the perfect time to bring the family with small kids in . i had the surf & turf burrito , it was very good and fresh . the staff was very friendly . we 'll come back for sure !
1	5 star food and service the last three times ive gone there. the food is great and super valued. i hope its there for a long time ! !
1	phenomenal food . seating area is always kept clean . overall a fantastic place to eat at . great service . they speak english and also spanish . by far my favorite mexican food restaurant in arizona
1	they are currently expanding to larger location incorporating the next door location . tried the bondiola and ribeye steak sandwich . for apps we did steak empanadas with papas cuna . came out excellent . service was phenomenal . well worth it and will come back next time i 'm in town .
1	every visit has been a positive experience ... always friendly service ... fresh authentic mexican food prepared by long time employees ... they offer options when placing an order and each dish is served made to order ... best tamales in town , among other yummy menu items ! cute traditional decor and casual atmosphere make this spot a local favorite for lunch or dinner . if you crave real deal mexican ... you will crave el molino !
1	excellent service , excellent food and killer margaritas . my lamb chops were incredible !
1	5 stars all the way , amazing atmosphere amazing food , great service , phenomenal drinks omg loved everything
1	i 've dined at this location dozens of times and i am always fully satisfied . try the street platter appetizer . the components vary day to day but it 's normally a winner . also , i am a huge fan of every single taco on the menu . not crazy about the crab guacamole but what do you expect . definitely one of my favorite locations in the area !
1	only $ 2-3 bucks , and i 'll usually get them through the drive thru . it is greasy and cheesy with ham sometimes bacon . they may use 3 eggs , not too sure . you will be stuffed after this burrito--i usually have to share with a co-worker . i come here just for the breakfast burrito but too bad they stop serving it after 10 or maybe it 's 11 . it makes me feel greasy-maybe not the best way to start a day but a great way to fill a craving .
1	a-mazing all around ! ! ! the food was so yummy ! ! ! authentic , homemade mexican ! but what i really appreciated was the service ! ! our server val was the sweetest most attentive and helpful person ever ! ! ! ! she had patience with us and went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of . her and chris both came around often to see if we needed anything . he was such a sweetheart as well , who ever hired those two did a great job ! i definitely will be returning when i visit las vegas , and will recommend it to my friends and family . it was a great experience !
1	the only negative here is the drive-through is wrapped around the building but they have a very efficient system so it 's not too bad . can go inside the nice air conditioning . remember when you order to ask for animal style it 's delicious .
1	the food was standard cheap mexican food. good , but nothing special. this is the kind of place where you feel good about giving them your money !
1	we always come here after picking up / dropping off at the airport since its ohh ~ 9 minutes away ! really great spot too if you 're coming for lunch . service is really fast . food taste delicious . salsa bar is huge ! huge fan of the el gaucho and the la santiama tacos . the mahi mahi here is also beyond delicious . i 've always found that 2 tacos al la carte is perfectly fulfilling but my brother loves their burritos !
1	my other favorite is rolando 's on 35th and peoria but i don 't live over there anymore . thankfully i live less than a mile from this gem .
1	i was greeted as i walked in , they asked if i 've been here before ( i haven 't ) , gave me recommendations , they also took the time to tell me what everything was on the salsa bar ! great customer service makes for a great experience ! thank you & if i wasn 't only visiting az i would come here often !
1	jared , the cashier is an absolute dear and he should be a manager , but the food was so subpar . my bean burritos were leaking and the beans seemed like they were days old . the nachos were put in my bag upside down- so not cool .
1	i can speak for the following . duck fat fries - some of the best fries i 've ever had , period . octopus - a flavor experience well worth it lamb carpaccio - so thinly sliced it melts in your mouth . mix some yolk and corn shoot with it , spread on crostini and it works very well . just be aware , there are community tables .
1	food is great , filling and well prepared . owner is great to talk to and will answer your questions . after eating at many taco places around the city this is the one i will continue to go to time and time again .
1	after visiting many of the strip restaurants , we are so glad to have landed here for brunch . outstanding service , delicious food , huge portions , and reasonable prices . just down the street from rio , you need to come here for breakfast or lunch . there were 7 of us , all our food was hot and delivered with minimal wait !
1	the food was amazing albeit a little expensive for what you actually get . disappointing , yet understandable because they are part of a resort . but everything went well and she was very patient with me . i was # beyondobsessed with both the house guacamole and the regular guacamole , as i said the food was amaze ! so i left her a $ 5 tip ( i was dining alone ) i can 't wait to bring a friend with me the next time i 'm near arizona grand resort
1	i always order one of the two options : stuffed avocados with chicken or half of chicken with rice , beans , yuca sides and herbal lemonade . the employees of this location are very helpful and friendly ! the managers are always there and make sure that the place runs smoothly .
1	this location is no different . the advantage ? management makes the difference . i eat here too much and when i have had issues not only have they made it good but they 've implemented some course of action to do something to make headway for the next time .
1	basing this solely on the type of restaurant they are , los betos is pretty damn good ( and affordable too ) . monster burritos , cooked up and delivered in the drive through at record breaking pace along with some killer red salsa . i love los betos for their quick and easy way of getting me a delicious breakfast burrito on the go when all you really want in the morning ( or late at night - they 're open 24 hours ) is a tasty gut bomb that is mexican fast food .
1	need a clean bathroom ? qt has that . do you want a choice of like a billion kinds of ice tea ? qt has that ( almost ) . you can even choose cubed or crushed ice . baked goods , hot foods ( i 'm addicted to the steak and cheese taquitos ) , frozen drinks , qt has those too . and they never seem to get beat on their gas price . lobe this qt !
1	5 stars for a good crane asada burrito that hit the spot .
1	carne asada is great here of course , but really , i love being a 4 minute walk from some of the best birria de chivo ever . big chunks of lamb , little chunks of fat , in a spicy , soupy broth . great head , too . by that , i mean i love their cabeza taco . plus , they are open late .
1	treated me with respect . they took pride in providing me a quality product and did so with gratitude . i ate the carne asada burrito with a side of rice and beans , then ordered one more for the road .
1	the service was good , but the food was impressive ! ! the only hard part about coming here is deciding what the heck to order . i ordered the steak with cilantro and i am still dreaming about it 2 days later . it was tender and perfectly cooked . the drinks are great too , the mangoniada is a must try and the micheladas are amazing . this place is also really nice inside and out , beautifully decorated ! ! this is a must in vegas ! !
1	this place is amazing ... wife on the grill , nicest kids serving and working hard , dad stops in and says hello ( or " hola " ) . quality of the food was excellent . i will for sure stop by here when i am in the neighborhood craving some good / inexpensive authentic mexican food . just a word of warning - their english is not the best - my wife asked for the bathroom and got a box . all good ... was yummy .
1	thank god for the staff because boy do they need them to keep this place running . food is honestly terrible , i have yet to find something that 's actually good there besides beer and churros . i have gone multiple times starving because i didn 't have a chance to eat that day and even then the food isn 't good to me . if you 're looking for customer service , beer & churros this is your go to spot but if you 're looking for food i recommend mcdonald 's down the street on 75th ave and bell .
1	they reached out through yelp after my review to apologize again and offer me a gift card . very awesome customer service ! ! and the food is delish : )
1	shae told me she knew it needed to be done . shae is definite management material . she takes pride in doing a good job . keep up the good work shae ! !
1	they are always so nice and helpful and come to your table to check on you . i am not totally crazy about mexican food but it is a good option since i don 't eat meat but what i have had there has always been very good and fresh and my kids and husband love this place . the chips and everything from the salsa bar are really good . the place is clean and grandbaby likes all of the decorations , it keeps him entertained with looking around . definitely a must try if you haven 't been here yet .
1	by far the best indian food in c-u ! ! ! ! i 've been a loyal patron of bombay grille for years and just tried aroma - the food is so delicious , creative and affordable . be prepared for slow service , but it 's worth it . also our food didn 't arrive at the same time - so perhaps be prepared to share your curries while you wait !
1	we have been coming here for many years and can 't speak highly enough to the quality and freshness of the food and attentive staff . a family favorite where we bring out of town guests often ! way to go juan .
1	salpicon salad is a favorite . breakfast burros best in town . not measuring them against unrealistic expectations ; they are fast , fresh , friendly , and consistent . we eat here 2 / 3 times a month for 20 + years , and will continue to do so .
1	we go here every once in a while for chicken enchiladas verdes and their chicken tostada salad . the happy hour deals are only offered in the bar area and include menu specials as well as drink specials . pros : inexpensive food & drinks , fun staff cons : i wouldn 't come here anytime other then happy hour because it is very much a bar with bar food .
1	great selection of apps from $ 4- $ 7 and the portions were more than i expected for tapas . the sangria was fantastic and only $ 5 . happy hour is sunday-thursday 4-5 : 30pm
1	and , sometimes the wait can be long , which i like because i can relax by the pool . awesome . oh oh oh , i love that they don 't use lard or put dairy in their guac . 5 starts , 5 stars ! ! !
1	: ) ( the opening manager who handles the name list ) definitely worth the wait and the popcorn chicken is a must .
1	best margarita in town ! ! he felt with our crowd like a pro !
1	we had a caterer scheduled for lunch today at work for employee appreciation week who did a no call / no show , and i called roberto 's to see if they can make 90 tacos within a half hour . they made three types of tacos within our requested time frame , packed them nicely and helped us load them in the car . they were delicious ! thank you for saving the day !
1	hands down our favorite for mexican food . never had a bad experience . fajitas are fantastic of course , but everything else we 've tried has been excellent as well . lots of flavor and huge portion sizes . the bean dip and salsa they bring to start are yummy , chips are fresh and warm , service is always top notch ! kids meals are a wonderful value as well and come with a drink . other mexican restaurants are much closer to us , but juan 's is worth the drive !
1	they treat you like gold here . the price is fantastic . i love the salsa and you get it free with a nice set of perfectly salted chips . great options for vegetarians which always scores brownie points in my book . los cabos is a formidable addition to a block that already includes greats like brillo box and taste of india .
1	i figured that service for so many people would take forever . definitely not--drinks came out quick , food didn 't take too long , and i didn 't see a single wrong order . our waitress was awesome . she had great suggestions ( get the cheese crisp with carnitas for an appetizer--yum ! ) . she also had no problem with me asking for my mango margarita on the rocks instead of frozen . highly recommended for a group .
1	this dive is nothing fancy , but the bean and cheese burrito is delicious and the red hot sauce is amazing ! my hubbie likes the chorizo , but any of the breakfast burritos will do . my one hesitation about the food here is the enchilada sauce , it 's from a can and not very good . otherwise , go eat and enjoy !
1	durable , nice color , all around glorious ! food is good .
1	no one beats their homemade tortillas . also love their tacos and green burros .
1	i like al pastor tacos and here i didn 't like them . so if you like carne asada tacos go here .
1	huge portions ( woohoo leftovers for lunch tomorrow ) it 's your basic mexican restaurant décor . the food is served fast and the margaritas are to die for . only regret i didn 't order fried ice cream
1	definitely by far the best tacos we 've had in the city so far . ! i ordered the baja fish and blackened mahi mahi and my boyfriend ordered the baja and gorbornator . both fish tacos were a perfect mixture of an explosion of flavours and left me wanting more ! my boyfriend inhaled his before i even had the chance to steal a bite so safe to say he loved his as well . my fave was the mahi mahi and his was the gorbornator . place was packed , but an organized chaos . seating is very limited and cash only , but service is pretty quick considering . will definitely be back soon .
1	service and atmosphere was blah . food was amazing . got the voted # 1burro btw
1	the room and the tables are 2 stars . we went during peak lunch time and had to eat in the car because there were no seats available . we waited on line with local firemen , a postal worker and some soldiers . everyone was there for the food which was very flavorful . everything we had was delicious . the prices were very reasonable .
1	don 't knock it ' til you 've tried it ... because after you 've tried it , you won 't be able to knock it : )
1	i had the corn salad & fries . i didn 't like the fries & the corn salad was good . wish it had more corn . the sauce was a little sweet too . but the chicken was a hit with my family and that empanada was to die for i bought one just to taste made me want to turn around and get more ! the sauce was amazing . gooey hot cheese and the chicken was flavorful . light and flaky crust .
1	best garlic shrimp i 've had in my whole life . the corn tortillas are homemade and the white rice is delicious .
1	probably one of the many reasons i will never see a six pack on my body , but i 'm okay with that . seriously , the sweet and salty combo of this shake soothes my soul . the burgers not bad either . although i wouldn 't be upset if an in n out were to move into arcadia .
1	6 when your drunk off tequila . now go here and cherish every chewing moment .
1	they must be cheerleaders ? ! omg ! this is not normal ! food is also good at this taco bell !
1	best in the valley by far . cant say enough . chorizo and bean burro made long is my favorite . sometimes double wrapped if i am feeling skinny . hot sauce is good . chips are good . not always as clean as it could be but thats due to being busy all the time and not a fault of the wait staff or management .
1	50 things under 7 $ several under 5 $ . breakfast here rules . if your on a budget this is the spot , and the food 's good either way .
1	the prices are great . it 's a great place to stop by while running errands- not so much a place you want to hang w friends at it go on a date night . the interior is basic cafeteria style and i didn 't care much for the chipped side plates : i know they add ambiance and charm but from a health stand point those cracks harbor bacteria . i still stand by my 5 stars for the food , prices and service . cheers .
1	the drunken nachos were amazing . try the mexican side car as the perfect drink for nachos !
1	they were so accommodating to my giant order for the guys at work ... 10 churros at 8 : 30 am ! so many breakfast burritos . they are fast , super friendly and it 's very clean : )
1	i love menudo but just the corn so i ask for just corn . most places just serve me whatever they serve which i hate . but this place did actually try to remove all of the meat from my bowl ! i was extremely happy ! they serve homemade tortillas just like my aunt makes which i love ! the waitress was very attentive and the food good . i will be coming back for more !
1	and 5 stars for rox ! ! ! she has amazing customer service and i 'm excited to try her invention of vinegarrette with sour cream . thanks , rox !
1	cuban sandwich and my alcapurias were made perfect to my liking . the new location is bigger than their old one but food tastes the same . i will always recommend this spot to anyone who wants to eat caribbean food .
1	the staff is incredibly friendly ! nice to get a solid meal and not have to worry about dressing up at all !
1	amazing mexican food . your typical hole in the wall spot / setting . i wasn 't worried about whether the floors were really all that clean or not , esp during prime time . if the food is good enough to impress an authentic mexican ( my gf ) , then it must be good right ? ! i love mexican food , and a lot of mexican spots don 't serve pollo en mole which is surprising , you must try it ! the tacos are always good , and the tortas are better than most other places . nothing negative to say about this place currently . will keep coming back here .
1	5 stars , good clean food and the customer service is number one.i 'm always busy but every time i stop by , i leave with a smile.respectfully , buche ! ! ! !
1	i had the pork and tried it with all of the amazing sauces available . the pork was cooked perfectly with tremendous flavor . the texture was something that could be imitated , but not mirrored . i will be back to this restaurant as soon as possible .
1	it was hot , flaky and delicious ! reminds me of an empanada but 10x better ! the guy ( owner ? ) was rude though : /
1	service provided by zack added to the amazing ambiance of toros . it is a must do for all visiting vegas . hands down the best meal we have had while here . the escargot , antipasto platter and padron peppers were delectable . the bread pudding melts in your mouth and is a flavor explosion combined with the sauce and ice cream . drive as quickly as allowed to toros . it will be an experience you are sure to become addicted to !
1	the food here is delicious ! ! we have been here a couple of times and each time have been treated great and definitely have not been disappointed by the food ! its recommended to call in your order so you can just pick it up and take it home as there is no seating available but definitely worth it ! we have had the empanadas ( to die for ) and the mofongo with carne frita , both are amazing !
1	it was delicious ! i had brunch here today . love the ambiance . our server was tony who was friendly and attentive . one of the chefs came to our table and checked on us . customer service was great ! now for the food , i had chilaquiles and french toast ( i was starving ) . loved my orders . food is authentic , the only i didn 't like were the black beans with my meal-everyone else loved it though . my sister had the barbacoa and my bf had a burrito . everyone was beyond satisfied . our bill was cheap . i 'm coming back next week for brunch .
1	this place was incredible . the service was outstanding . and the food will leave you speechless ! don 't hesitate to try the lamb chops ... food heaven on earth . i got the lamb chops dish with spanish rice instead of mashed potatoes . also , the calamari was exceptional and fried to perfection . the red snapper and shrimp is a great option for your main course as well . their sangria and margaritas are some awesome choices for drinks . you just can 't go wrong with any choices , you will be impressed .
1	this place does a few dishes and they do them to perfection . do you want an amazing chicken empanada with the perfect salsa to garnish it ? then go here . best order if you are new to empanadas or chilean food : " can i have one chicken and one cheese empanada please " the salsa comes with it so make sure you get that as well . friendly staff - can get pretty busy , but takeout is always a great option - not hard to just pop them in the toaster oven . enjoy !
1	i 've been wanting to try this place for over a year and finally came .. sooooooo tasty ! i feel like i 'm in mexico ! i had a lengua taco , asada mulas , and a asada vampiro . all 3 were yummazing ! service was very fast & very friendly . the place was also clean inside and smelled goooood . i 'm sold ! ! ! officially in love and will return anytime my taco craving hits : ) ) )
1	4 de buche por favor . if your in town make the drive it 's worth your while ... big plus they 're open late for those late night munchies ! ! !
1	i wasn 't disappointed . the tacos were amazing . the meats are a bit spicy so beware . the decor is adorable as well . definitely will be back sooner than later
1	pomegranate margaritas and carne asada , all day . this javiers did not disappoint . its a little different vibe from the crystal cove location but it still has amazing dishes and great drinks . perfect place to entertain clients in las vegas . inside the aria nxt to the casino tables , which is a perfect way to finish off dinner !
1	really good and authentic tasting . the owners are super friendly , food came out fast ! differently coming back
1	excellent , unique breakfast in etobicoke . i really enjoy it when i get time to go down to lakeshore and eat here . it costs me 20 $ for breakfast and worth every bit of it
1	5 stars for the food . yes it does taste like i remember . i will be coming back
1	we had the fish tacos , skirt steak tacos , pepper jack chorizo queso dip and purist margarita . we loved it all . fun atmosphere and excellent service . definitely a place we will be coming back to soon . kevin was our server and he was fantastic !
1	this place is great even though it 's a taco truck fresh carne asada fresh beans fresh everything . i would pick this place over any mexican restaurant anytime . i 've went in the morning at 10 am and 2 a.m. and it 's still the best quality of food . i wish they would open a restaurant and they be making bank . never had a bad experience and recommend it to anybody and everybody ! ! ! !
1	this place is super yummy . to start , we had the chips and guac with pineapple . a really good combination . super fresh . i got the pork adovado taco and a coffee braised beef taco . incredible . i 'm pretty sure you can 't go wrong with anything on the menu . also ordered the sangria and it was a bit strong but really refreshing . love this place . the decor is awesome and low key vibe . highly recommend .
1	food was awesome and service top notch ! ! to the manager you have lucky to don 't get a nasty review from us cause i see you where making a big deal of serve my drinks at 6 : 45 pm to enjoy the happy hour , my friend be in the customer side when they are right . anyways thanks we really enjoy it .
1	no more having to hit the atm first ! holler ! ! also , now that i 've fully fallen into the dark world of tacos , rolberto 's has some of the absolute best carnitas , and adobada in the area ... where as most similar places of this type serve an obviously processed , previously frozen iteration of carnitas and adobada , rolberto 's seems far more genuine and homemade . also , it 's very much a family owned / operated type place , and i just love the hell out of it ! ! ! so glad it 's so close to my house !
1	he is always courteous and efficient and enjoys what he does . he should be a manager .
1	wonderful spices and flavor combinations . couldn 't have been better . can 't wait to come back ! the tomatillo sauce is amazing !
1	yes ! why ? everything was on point ! food beer , service and price . i had four dishes .... dates , chorizo clams , pulpo ( octopus ) asado , and albondigas ( meatballs ) ! all were exceptional ! and i am from la so i know good food . a serious must try . or i should say don 't come at all so i can have the place all to myself ! i have never been to an establishment when i didn 't have any negative criticism . karen and omar at the bar were amazing ! i 'm coming back tomorrow . shhhh but don 't tell anyone !
1	we used to live in the studios right across the street and literally ate at sabor 4-5 times a week . my go to is always the epic protein bowl , and my wife the nachos . we deviate sometimes and get the elote , or some tacos and never have regretted it . one time the cashier literally ran out the door after me because they forgot one taco ! not surprised sabor is blowing up and expanding all over charlotte , it 's well deserved .
1	i 've been coming regularly for the last month , consistency is key . really enjoy the burger and fries every time i visit ! ! best burger and fries in the area , great value also ! ! 1 / 4lb international and cheese with french fries for $ 5.42 after tax , such a solid price . if you 're driving by do yourself a favor and stop in and enjoy the smells and the food ! !
1	total hole in the wall - in an somewhat odd location . but worth the trek ! tried chips / salsa - red is hot , good ... green is very tasty - tangy even . i could eat that all day . fresh fried chips were spot-on too . created own tres taco plate with pastor , shrimp & cochinita . all were quite delicious ! next time i will be ordering the pastor and cochinita again - they were awesome . nice presentation & great personal service too ! try it for yourself if near the airport or south strip .
1	all the food is wonderful . great atmosphere and ambiance . the almejas al vapor and the pumpkin bread pudding are amazing.oh .. and the guac is good , too . ( tableside ) margaritas aren 't too shabby either . good place for a date .
1	one of the best managers around . keep up the good work !
1	i had these delivered at 1am to my hotel so they were kind of soggy but still soo good ! ! hands down one of the best tacos i 've had to date !
1	this place is so good ! sweet potato fries are to die for . every time i come in the staff is friendly and helps with everything . they discontinued some tacos i get and she gave me a free entree for not having it ! great customer service and great food !
1	i am a mole freak . the first time i had mole it was hand made in a process that took 6-8 hours . it spoiled me . if mole is on a restaurant 's menu i will try it and usually with disasterous results . this is the first place in years and years .... and years that has chicken mole that was as good as the homemade batch that spoiled me . and for $ 6.99 ? ? ? jeeez . i think i 'm tearing up . also the horchada is ridiculous ... get it .
1	( lunch special ) love it . great service as well .
1	got the baja fish tacos and devoured it pretty quick , even though it was a bit messy . the size is decent , with a good amount of fish and veggies , but the tacos were double layered which is a plus . they have a couple other flavours to choose from . the gobernador also caught my eye which has smoked shrimp and cheese , will definitely come back to try when i 'm in the area . also , this place only accepts cash ! !
1	very authentic food . i asked if i could have them spicier and they definitely delivered . the chips and salsa were great , too . they have a wide variety of authentic drinks if you want alcohol . all in all , a nice quiet spot i will definitely return to .
1	i walked in sofrito rico about 45 mins after they open , so it was quite which was nice , first come first serve . you can get takeout , so i got my order to go , i ordered tostones pernil arroz y gander , and solomillo y cebolla . everything smelled so amazing on the way home i wanted to rip those containers open , but i waited , and the food was delicious . just like the food i grew up on back home . next time , i want to sit in and eat here .
1	a few locations here and there seem to have robots running the place , but not this signal butte store . holy cow ! ! -- they 're lively and energetic and i feel very appreciated .
1	chipotle is good and convenient , but this bowl was much tastier , and actually cheaper .
1	either way , only burrito in the entire city i am able to eat multiple times per week and never get sick of .
1	yea ! ! we went back and they are open .. the owner talked with us and they had an emergency . im glad they are still here ! i tried the green chili plate that has pork , rice , beans and flour tortilla . it was delicious ! ! my husband had the carne asada tacos and bean and cheese burritos . loved it ! ! cant get enough of this place we will be back . they may be small but they know how to cook mexican food and the customer service is fantastic ! !
1	a perfectly cooked juicy breast and wing seasoned with rotisserie and just a little chili spice on a bed of white rice , yummy peruvian beans and a salad . they throw in a tasty little cup of chicken soup on top of it and a inka cola . awesome . so good i hurt myself by eating too much .
1	i can 't cook unless it is on a grill so when it is dinner time and the kids need to eat , this was the spot . i was just giving it a shot and i was super impressed . the chicken was very good , the beans were fantastic with a smoky taste , and their tacos are so simple but hands down my favorite part . thanks for making my life easy el pollo .
1	it 's only available at the bar lounge area . for $ 40 we had a delicious assortment of tapas and two drinks . the drinks are wayyyy weak imho , but it was $ 5 a cocktail . be sure to ask about their daily special ! they were featuring scallops when we were there . * * the regular dining is no where near $ $ two dollar signs as rated on yelp . it 's easily $ 75 / person there . * *
1	i haven 't danced that much in years and it was fun to be around other ppl who love the music as much as me ! a nice diverse crowd and a great time . i will definitely be back .
1	so they have mojitos here , and they are actually made the proper way , probably one of the best i 've had in quite some time . our server was pretty cool , made sure we had everything we needed and was fast . i ordered the i got the shredded beef barbacoa , which was phenomenal ! any chance that i get , i will be coming here to try their other dishes .
1	they are open until 10 : 00pm . don 't advertise that you are open to 10 : 00pm and lock up at 9 : 30 because you want to get a head start on closing . i 'm updating this review because i received a phone call from the owner after sending them a email . he was extremely emphatic and assured me that he was unaware that they closed early . that is exactly the customer service that is admirable ! ! ! ! ! he even comped two free meals for me to redeem at a location which is closer to my home ! thanks dano !
1	9 / 5 stars this is not a pretty place , its about amazing food and great value highly highly recommend get the jumbo beef burrito it will put a huge smile on your face
1	the green salsa , spicy and tasty ! can 't wait to get my free taco !
1	.99 cent shrimp cocktails .friendly staff .beautiful scenery .outstanding cooks what are you waiting for ? come eat here !
1	fresh lettuce and cheese . your choice of chicken or shredded beef . the salsa bar is clean and items are spicy . the orchata is refreshing and tasty . restaurant is clean . has a cheerful decor . the service is quick .
1	food is great , prepared well and great portions . great seasonings and plenty of toppings and fillings . great menu , good price , good service . loved it ! thanks yelp for suggesting a great little find !
1	their service is great and so is their food . they can be really packed on taco tuesday 's but the line goes fast and the food still comes out just right . also , free chips with your order !
1	the ambiance was great - some noise letting you know others were there enjoying themselves , but not overpowering . lots of good things on the menu with reasonable pricing . great chips , margaritas and sangria . wait staff smiling. pleasant and knowledgeable . the food was mexican , but with sort of a continental flair without a hot mexican spicing and cheeses . all who love mexican food were happy and people like me - well i had the angel hair pasta , shrimp , peppers etc . we all would and will go back . thank you abuelos for a good time .
1	great carne asada tacos & their salsas are all bomb . this is our fave mexican spot in the area
1	we got there early and by the time we were done eating the line was out the door . and they serve beer . so i 'll be back soon .
1	a1 the service is excellente and the price is good they are a worm place to be and lovly people ... 10 / 10 keep the good job ... go and try it u we come back and back to it .
1	love everything about it ... well , almost .... the only thing i don 't like it the price of each arepa , but the taste is worth it , so i 'll dish out the cash .... i will mention that i come from a community ( outside of las vegas ) where i used to get arepas and other latin @ delicacies for under $ 3 ... for vegas , i love arepas is perfect ! maybe they should offer a " locals " deal : - ) just a thought ...
1	the freshness and care of the food preparation makes this a must . it 's just off of 77 and 485 , so easy to get to for a large area . make sure you get the pot brownie !
1	if i could give 6 stars i would have . will be back for sure . new favorite restaurant .
1	i get into a groove here and want to go alllll the time ! the arroz chaufa with chicken is my go to with the awesome sauces ! the herbal limeade is good too !
1	oh and martha is incredible and you can tell she makes everything with love ! ! ! !
1	definitely recommend this place to anyone who really enjoys real authentic mexican food ! : ) sooo don 't complain about the wait ! it takes time to make good food !
1	i can 't express how awesome this place is . i have the rosemary braised beef sandwich with empanadas and papas . i want to bring this place back to ny with me . best sandwich i have ever had .
1	lamb was good but a little overcooked & fatty . this last time we tried their desserts for the first time .. we got the sample platter & everything was good. nothing over the top like there food though. cna 't wait to go back again : )
1	omg sum of the best iv ever had , plus the jute box is new and updated , play some great music and enjoy some delicious sea food in a lovely enviroment ...
1	so delicious , very flavorful ! ! ! had their buffet , chile verde , chile rojo enchiladas ! ! ! margaritas ! ! ! out of this world ! ! definitely 5 stars ! ! ! will come back again ! ! ! yummy ! ! !
1	trust in him for amazing cocktails and great food recommendations ! surf and turf was cooked perfectly and seasoned to perfection . 5 stars without a doubt ! great place for date nights and for a great vibe . even with seating available i would go to bar to get aaron 's expertise and knowledge on the food and drinks ! 5 stars is an understatement .
1	aaron took my drive thru order on 9 / 18 at 8 : 10pm and he needs a broadcasting job or a spot on talk radio or some kind of announcing job cuz his voice is unreal .
1	everything we ordered looked just as good as it tasted . the wine and beer selection was diverse and impressive . i can 't even pick a favorite dish because everything was perfect . must try : mushroom grits , tomato caper flatbread , jumbo lump crab lettuce cups , and wagyu skirt steak . i will recommend this to everyone who comes to las vegas and i will be returning every time i visit .
1	this place is very close to those in the la and sd areas . a must is the carne asada burrito , torta 's , or for sharing , asada fries or nachos ! breakfast is pretty good here too , plenty of chorizo dishes ! the chicken is ok , with the carnita 's being the better choice . the salsa rojo and verde is not too bad , plenty of flavor and heat ! the cooks are pretty cool , order in spanish ! very easy on the wallet and it 's open late !
1	best steak burrito had in years ! great toppings , good price , great value ; my new haunt
1	he was super hospitable . my parents had never had moroccan an so it was great when he explained tajine and recommended it . it was delicious and perfect for a first time moroccan experience . as we walked in we noticed he was giving a traveler some recommendations and directions around spain . he seemed just as excited to do that as every other subject with every other customer . great experience . great food ! ! ! i would definitely return ! ! ! i was visiting my parents from new mexico and think i will make it a tradition
1	good . ) , as well as individual couscous dishes ( including a vegetarian one for myself ) . date shakes followed for dessert , and moroccan iced tea was plentiful . their customer service was great , and the food was very flavorful . he charged us $ 12.95 / person , which was a great deal considering the large amount of food ! nice ambiance and decor for a small seating area , felt cozy . definitely recommend , and hope to go back soon !
1	a simple concoction , yes - but an establishment that takes the time to make really great tasting beans and wrap them in a great tortilla - is my kind of place . los favoritos makes a stellar bean burrito , as well as an outstanding carne asada burrito . others i 've gone with have liked their food very much as well , but i haven 't been able to get past those burritos . great green and red salsa in squeeze bottles . definitely a go-to place for fast ( but good ) food .
1	i tried the mexican plate which was delicious and filling . the cozy decor is a plus !
1	the huevos rancheros and chilaquiles are so delicious ! and the churros made my birthday brunch perfect . ladera is a treat so treat yourself !
1	2am , heck yes ! , the service fast , the taste , amazing for the middle of the night !
1	( for a long term relationship , this could create some serious problems when it comes to eating out . ) not skimpy on portions . this place is an excellent choice if you want to stuff your face but can 't do enough damage to justify eating ayce . or if you just want it fast and easy because sometimes you just need it that way . the rice could use some work , but there 's nothing you can 't fix a little in vegas to make it a vegas 10 . and promise ... you will leave here stuffed with a smile on your face . see you for my next vegas sushi hook up , soho !
1	dakota and lana didn 't miss a beat and took impeccable care of us . there 's an awesome all-inclusive deal for $ 15 ( we had ~ 20 ) that included apps , salad , and tacos . plus some margarita pitchers , everyone paid $ 23 . awesome deal . thanks , lana and dakota !
1	i may have found new foreign cuisine love . i never had venezuelan dishes before . it turns out , they are down right delicious . and the hit sauce is down right hot and delicious . at first my novio and i were stuck at the counter . we are both vegetarians , so it was difficult to make entree selections . but the family behind the counter was very helpful for giving us the right substitution and guiding through the menu . they are such nice people ! ! wouldn 't you love talking to the owners who are enthusiastic about introducing their culture ? whatever you order , don 't forget the two things : tamarindo + hot sauce = happiness .
1	he was so attentive and gave us quick and quality service , and was super helpful with recommendations and tips on food items . he is a big reason we will keep coming back here ! and of course the yummy food and happy hour specials don 't hurt ! ; )
1	you take care and treat everyone with excellence . make sure dean and chris help you with the delicious and well prepared food decisions . they provide excellent service .
1	we made lots of new friends and never got tired of the food ! we love you , cave creek ! thank you for everything . see you next year ! -hellanbach inc .
1	the owner saw i was taking one to go and asked why and if i didn 't like it , i explained they were so good i had to take one home to my husband and he said oh no way ! he insisted i eat the one i had at the table and made me a fresh free one to go for my hubby ! # customersforlife
1	but the food was phenomenal ! ! ! we had the quesadilla pizza and enjoyed every bite !
1	only thing i 'd wish they would change is for the margaritas to have a frozen option , but don 't worry they 're still delicious
1	the food was fantastic . reminded me of being back in hawaii . don 't forget to try the guava cake . i will be back next time i am in vegas ..
1	best beans i have ever tried ( except moms ) and the pollo fundidos are wonderful !
1	a bit pricier than your average mexican food place , but definitely the best taco 's i 've had. each taco is pretty big. full after 2 or 3 of them .
1	pete 's doesn 't come close . crispy , always fresh , and generous portions for $ 5.99 . one of my favs when not getting the green chili beef items . fish tacos kill rubio 's here too . bigger , crispier , and way fresher tasting .
1	for the cost , it was really good . $ 2 tacos .
1	best tacos ever . fresh food was cooked on order . i ate here and got my car washed next door instead of waiting at the dmv for my number to be called .
1	i was the only gringa in the restaurant where i had a asada quesadilla , which came with salad and jalapeño and limes . great service , and great energy ! i 'm glad i was walking up 7th street and saw the mexican families streaming in !
1	drinks are affordable as is the food . lots of different tequilas . if you like trendy avocado cali mexican recommend you stay away ( please ) . this place is traditional tacky , but if you like this style you won 't be disappointed . been seeing more and more german cars in the parking lot lately . ugh .
1	i have no complaints at all . the food is good quality , and the price is just right for the big burrito with fresh queso and chips ! definitely recommend this place .
1	the multiple visits should speak for itself as this place is good . absolutely everything appears to be unique and if your order fits your taste , expect to be impressed .
1	great prices and consistently great food . lunch special is . $ 7 for 2 items and $ 5 for 1 along with rice and beans and chips . love their chile relleno and the burritos . we splurged and got churros and fried ice cream . just what we needed ! decor is bright and cheerful !
1	first , the chips and salsa are outstanding . both salsas , the medium and the hot ! i love their double sized chili relleno . and their chicken with spinash dish is most creative and tasty . but save room for the dessert tamal of chocolate with cinnamon ice cream ! ! !
1	we 've tried pretty much every mexican food restaurant in the valley . excellent service , good quality food that tastes amazing . the chili shrimp dish is awesome . great hot sauce ! ! happy hour is pretty crowded but worth the wait .
1	the nachos are huge . the food is awesome . missed coming here since moving from so cal !
1	same yummy food-- in a safer hood & cleaner surroundings ! this is a must visit ! ! !
1	this is a locally owned family owned business that takes pride in servicing the customer . the freshest quality ingredients are used , all at a competitive price . i 've eaten here over a dozen times and have enjoyed every time .
1	i had been a loyal diner at another restaurant nearby , but it was recommended that i try fiesta jalapeños in medina . all i can say is i will never go to another mexican restaurant again . customer service is incredible .. the staff is friendly and always have smiles on their faces . the food .. is incredible ! from the meat dishes .. to fish dishes to the array of vegetarian options . i even asked for a special request of a jalapeño margarita .. and they made it perfectly ! can 't wait to go back ! i recommend you visit fiesta jalapeños soon !
1	servings are generous , service is quick , and the margaritas are great . it does get crowded , though , so avoid friday / saturday nights if you don 't want to wait .
1	for my lunch hour i enjoy good fast food and chipotle always delivers . the one thing that has always stood out about chipotle is the fact that they have moist brown rice . this is a big deal because as i am trying to be heath conscious its a hard thing to achieve . always in the mood for chipotle .
1	on a cold winter night we felt like summer was within reach . the decor is fun and colorful . the food was great and the variety pleased all of us . the service was wonderful , also . we plan to return soon .
1	friendly staff , generous and delicious portions and cozy , warm ambience . great to hear festive music on a cold and blustery day . love the quesadillas , guacamole and burritos in particular . have been a dozen times or more as i work at the end of the street . the owners are very generous and care about the community and customers they serve too . i love supporting independent restaurants as i 'm not a big fan of large chain , generic restaurants . will be back soon !
1	i could live here ! ! ! ! ! i had tacos and they were so good i ordered 10 to go ! ! !
1	they have upgraded the steak multiple times and you can tell . the angus beef is delicious . they have the best chimichanga i 've ever tasted in my life . the carne asada fries will put robertos out of business . everything is delicious there . very rarely do i leave reviews but that 's the least i can do for somewhere that provides such great food and service .
1	i 've tried a few of the other options here and they were all good but the fish tacos are my favorite . the serving sizes were also bigger than i expected .
1	the two of us shared the coconut shrimp , fish burger , and fish taco . best seafood i 've ever had . i could eat this every day . a. m. a. z. i. n. g .
1	the only frybread i prefer over this place would be the home-made frybread my friends rocky and mario would make , so you know i 'm not messing around with this , folks . try their amazing frybread tacos , which was vegetarian friendly , btw and if you do eat meat , their green chili is an absolute delight . cheap , quick , and open late--- if i could give this place 10 stars , i would .
1	the quesadilla especial is unreal . prices are low food and service is great !
1	the tortillas they use are also very good , tastes like my aunt 's homemade ! they also offer mango salsa , everything was delicious . the staff was courteous and the meals were reasonably priced . i 'd definitely visit again , this isn 't your local filiberto 's ! i wish everyone would stop comparing them to chipotle . this is baja mexican , and chipotle is americanized mexican food . two different things , that 's like comparing kansas city bbq to memphis bbq , both good , but different .
1	absolute best place to eat in all of arizonan the food is magnificent it 's delicious every time never been disappointed great serviceall-around awesome place and totally affordable something for everyone
1	absolute best salsa and chips in town ....... the service is awesome as well !
1	people of pittsburgh should flock to this place and be lining up out the door . the sandwiches , salads , and apps are amazing . the sauces to accompany the empanadas and sandwiches are also delicious . wow is all i can say !
1	my husband and i go about twice a week . fresh toppings bar with any kind of salsa you could ask for , guacamole , fresh limes , cilantro . the pico de gallo is to die for . at $ 2.50 per taco , it 's cheaper than cooking at home !
1	definitely worth the $ $ . lunch time the meals are same portion for half price so sometimes i end up doing that on weekends
1	i order dinner from pio pio once a week , typically on sundays and usually get takeout . after placing an order it is typically ready within 10-20 minutes of the call . the food is absolutely amazing and the price point is unbeatable . my usual order is a whole rotisserie chicken , large rice and large beans . this order comes with two white sauce and two green sauce . i prefer the white sauce over the green sauce as the green sauce is very spicy . they have a small patio for outside dining and when i have eaten at the restaurant the service has always been great ! highly recommend ! authentic and delicious !
1	beans are like my nana 's . i recommend you try everything on the menu but if it 's your first time i suggest the green chile burrito ! they have an app i highly recommend that too . with all good things there 's a wait ... be ready and enjoy the deliciousness

1	a girlfriend and i went here for dinner and were very impressed . we ordered the mushroom risotto , spicy potatoes , oxtail , and colorado lamb . the oxtail was to die for , i could have ordered seven . the sangria had that slight hint of strawberry and cinnamon and was absolutely delicious . we regretfully did not order the paella , but the couple next to us did and it looked stunning . i will absolutely come back here every time i 'm in vegas .

1	my boyfriend was coming down to visit from la and i placed a request for kosher steak and the staff went above and beyond to accommodate ! ! ! the food was absolutely amazing ! ! !
1	does not taste like fast food one bit , but priced as such . the sauce they use tastes amazing , and their veggies are fresh and make the dish . their habanero and mild hot sauce are also very good . fast , courteous service .
1	always swing by this place when i 'm working in the area . fair priced , especially for such heavy and filling burritos . have always gotten all toppings , with noodles and medium spicyness . its quite spicy which is nice ( depending on who makes it . sometimes its pretty mild , while other times its pretty hot ) . in my opinion , the best burritos are the bbq shrimp ( fridays only ) , jerk chicken , and the boneless rib . the basa fish is quite mild in flavour , but is still very good . would definitely recommend this place !

1	the service alone made it worth it ! we felt like family here even though it was our first time . and the food was exceptional ! we had the cubana empanada , colombian rice , ham and cheese , bean and cheese , and arroz con pollo . you could not go wrong with any of these ! order multiple empanadas though as one probably won 't be enough . you 'll want more anyway

1	absolutely awsome place , food was fresh and so tasty , i love the staff , so friendly and professional , i highly recommended this great restaurant , lots of great choices on the menu , i tried the steak shawarma , it was delicious , im so happy i found this place , thank you for amazing food and service
1	absolutely baja fish tacos are fabulous and mariscos in a large glass with tortillas on the side and the chimichanga huge absolutely reminds me of being in ensenada
1	this place ruined any burto 's type place for me . they make their burritos abbot different beans in carne asada burro for example but it 's better in my opinion ! their salsa is insane good ! place is no joke and def worth a try . i like the green and chunky red . .... you 're welcome in advance
1	if you don 't know authentic mexican food then you won 't like this place but if you do this place will never let you down . fantastic salsa with chips made on the spot . juan ( the owner ) always greets us and says hello . if he doesn 't see us come in he will make a point to come by and say hello before we leave . couldn 't say enough great things about this place !
1	the service was prompt . the margarita was amazing ! best wings in charlotte ! the area are large and price is fair . absolutely love the deck atmosphere . must eat here frequently !
1	very fresh ingredients , perfect sauces and always cooked just right . great sopapillas come with every meal .
1	had the red jade chicken , emerald chicken quesadilla and jerk fried rice ... couldn 't be happier . this is " eat through the pain " food . which is the highest compliment i can personally give an establishment . even when i realized i should really stop eating - i just couldn 't . so , so , so good . will be back very soon ! ! !
1	food and service were both outstanding . went for breakfast and had the huevos rancheros and a green iced tea . the chef 's take on the rancheros was delicious , with gooey , melted cotijo cheese stuffed in the tortillas and perfectly poached eggs . the green tea - not normally something i love - was delicious , without the bitterness i usually expect from it . highly recommend
1	i love the papa loco , beans , tacos and salsa bar is super ! !
1	met the owner and he was so passionate about his place . also enjoyed his story about getting fired from chipotle to open the place .
1	all the best toppings available in the salsa bar ! friendly people and great fish tacos . best i 've had in az : )
1	i go here a couple times a week for lunch , since my office is just around the corner . always friendly and attentive service .
1	i tried beans and cheese , torta with pork belly and chips with guac . i will stop by here again . amazing food . this was some of the best food i have had in a while .
1	been coming the el pollo for years now . it 's always been delicious . i love their chicken . that 's the best thing they 've got on the menu in my opinion . give his place a try !
1	i would highly recommend this place . great salsa bar , secluded atmosphere . i take friends here from out of town to give them a real taste of mexican food !
1	our favorites were the fried cauliflower , beet salad and the scotch eggs . it 's a perfect spot for an intimate dinner , or a great place to sample some tasty tapas with friends . if you 're in the neighborhood , stop and sample !
1	the most accommodating buffet you will possibly find . i am vegan and chef malcolm ( super funny , cool dude btw ) was happy to give me a walk through so i knew all of the vegan options . there were several dishes they are happy to make specially veganized . love this place . every one in my party was fat and happy when we left .
1	homemade guacamole sauce , pico de gallo and limes . option ; flour or corn tortillas . this lil walk up window & order spot , will hit the mark with your tastebuds . aqua fresa , jimaica ( hibiscus ) , horchata , tea and other drinks available . reasonably priced , waddas does what you want it to , delight your street tacos taste budz .
1	i get a salad or a sandwich and it 's always amazingly delicious . lots of things on the menu i have yet to try but i can imagine it 's all good . it can form quite a line sometimes but it 's worth the wait .
1	been a vegas local for 10 years and had never heard of this place until i came here for lunch with some coworkers . service was great and food was fabulous . guacamole was fresh and chips had great flavor . salsa they brought out was mediocre ... definitely not made in house . i ordered the chimichurri steak salad . steak was cooked perfectly and everything had amazing flavor , just a tad heavy in the raw onions however .
1	been here twice now and both times the food was exceptional . a bit pricey for mexican , but it 's worth it . and the margaritas are wonderful as well . again , a bit pricey . i love the casual , cute decor .
1	best fast food mexican joint around , blows filibertos out of the water . the homemade horchata is to die for ..
1	blood mary was great and the avocado smash bowl was excellent !
1	came to a meeting and stopped by before for a quick bite and i will travel to avondale for this authentic fresh mexican food . i had a carnita taco and a carne azada taco with cilantro onion and lime ! yum ! best ever ! my fav hole in the wall officially ! and yes ! they have chiles torreados !
1	carne asada , tacos , enchiladas , quesadillas , etc .... dinner was perfect . i love the homemade tomatillos hot salsa . free sopspias ( so ? ) for dessert were very good . top notch service and very clean . we can 't wait to come back ! ! !
1	, choose your filling , then choose how hot you want it to be . ready in minutes , very generous sizes , and quite unique in edinburgh . there 's even a loyalty card scheme you can collect stamps on to go towards another meal . they also sell mexican sauces and spices behind the counter . the staff are very friendly and always trying to make their business even better - wish i still lived close by so i could frequent here more often , however delivery is always an option !
1	the real taste of cuba is in every dish with imported spices from cuba and my favorite dishes ropa vieja. delish . tamales are filled with roast pork . i had a mojito which was really refreshing . danced friday night till my feet were sore . live music and salsa lessons every friday and saturday . great place to be at if you like the cuban culture. i will definately return .
1	everything is fresh made right in front of you ! i 've been coming here ever since they opened and the menu just keeps getting better as it grows ! i love the bacon egg and hash breakfast burrito but i 'd say the chili verde is a favorite ! but you should put potatoes in it with cheese excellent ! ! and the owners are wonderful the staff is great and services is quick !
1	the sauces are amazing . the staff is very friendly and helpful . i recommend the arroz chaufa , the great with chicken and their fries are so crunchy and yummy. mmm
1	i am from houston texas and we stopped by this place hoping for some great mexican food and we were not disappointed ! i had the spicy pork tacos and they were amazing . other members of my party tried some of everything and they could not pick a favorite ! wish this place was a local spot for us , but we 'll just have to come back here next time we 're in vegas !
1	family owned , the entire staff is very friendly !
1	first time here and it certainly will not be the last . this is he best i have had in charlotte . you will not be let down .
1	first time here . met a coworker here for a meeting / lunch . we split the guacamole and 4 types of tacos . service was perfect . we arrived at 11 and were seated easily by the window . we left at 12 : 30 and the place was packed with a wait .
1	first time i went in i ordered tacos and the second time i ordered taquitos . both times were sooo good ! i can 't wait to go back . i don 't know how i didn 't know of this place sooner . i am hoping i can try everything on the menu . they even have " american " food and you 'd think the staff would be grumpy based on the non stop hustle but they are super nice and don 't rush you at all . can 't wait to go back .
1	fish tacos were so fresh with great flavor ! amazing chips and salsa ! definitely coming back !
1	and the salsa is addictive . so good that my friend and i dined here two nights in a row , when normally in vegas i like to explore different restaurants . i had the trio of seafood enchiladas ( lobster , crab , and shrimp ) , and they were delicious , and they were the first set of enchiladas i 've had in a long time where the cheese wasn 't dry and caked on the inside . the flavors , texture , and colors all worked magically together . i live in chicago and i still haven 't found a mexican restaurant that i like . here 's to wishing for a javier 's to open here .
1	be sure to get pupusas revueltas ( pork , beans , and cheese inside a tortilla ) . also , the fried yucca and chicaronnes are great . super authentic food . i 'll definitely be back ! ( only complaint : they close at 7 . such an odd closing time for dinner . )
1	portions are comfortably large ( enough for 2 meals for me ) . very , very fresh . i recommend the pabellon and the chicken empanadas . also tried the guava and cheese pastry .... wow .
1	authentic mexican food which sometimes is hard to find considering that there 's places that supposedly sell authentic mexican food and it 's not ! phenomenal service by everyone there . was greeted upon entering which some times is unusual in business . will definitely be coming back !
1	best mexican food i have had since i have been in the states . i was looking for a little piece of home and i have found it here .
1	i love the margaritas and the build your own taco menu . if you get a chance , their brunch is really great too .
1	huge portions . cheap prices . the only downside - it 's constantly packed with college kids , and the extremely limited space is quickly overflowing with ugg boots and axe body spray . get your order to go .
1	i got a delicious combination plate . everything was amazing so good , don 't be afraid to try this place if you 're not into spicy food , nothing was spicy if you want to add hot sauce you can i guess but this was delicious and perfect !
1	i had a chicken quesadilla and my husband had the tres tacos-chicken , beef and fish . the sangria margarita was delicious as well . we also ordered the chips and salsa for an extra $ 3 . the chips were warm and fresh and the salsa was awesome . our waitress was super nice and we loved having a seat by the canal . can 't wait to come here again when we visit vegas again !
1	i had the chicken fajitas and my husband had the chili relenos , enchilada and taco combination . all of the food was fresh and full of flavor . the jalapeño margaritas are out of this world . i wish i wasn 't so full from the food because i 'd love a second margarita . the staff was also super courteous and very friendly . i highly recommend this place .
1	food is 100 % authentic . great service . small restaurant , personalized service . great menu with a lot of variety and choices of many cuban dishes . enjoyed the music while we drank malta & jupinia sodas and ate our meals . so thankful to have found this authentic cuban restaurant in phoenix !
1	i highly recommend the shrimp tacos and the fish tacos . my husband loves the veracruz " flag " burrito . there is a fried cheesecake dessert that is the best one you will ever try . we have always received attentive service and have always had a pleasurable experience dining here . we enjoy sitting on the covered patio outside when weather is warm .
1	wonderful service ! i went by myself while on a business trip and the staff greeted me and talked with me about the restaurant . the tomato sauce is to die for . highly recommend trying this place !
1	family owned and service was great . best empanadas in toronto ! churros are freshly made daily . lomito sandwich is to die for . a must for anyone who loves south american food .
1	fresh ingredients that don 't hide under heavy sauces . great alternative to the regular taco shops .
1	fried but not too heavy or greasy . plantain and garlic is amazing , as is black bean and cheese . i need to try more varieties !
1	i would highly recommend this place if you are looking for something delicious and spicy .
1	great decor , awesome staff . tamales are the bomb ! yummy margaritas . new favorite mexican restaurant .
1	great food at great prices . free samples and the owner was awesome . will definitely be back for more food and good times . you can actually taste the freshness and the rice and sauces are all homemade . deeelicious ! ! ! !
1	we tried it on a whim and were really impressed . the mole taco was among the best mole i 've had , and the cochinita pibil was smokey and delicious . wish they had a spot like this in brooklyn !
1	great service . nice hole in the wall mexican food place , easy to pass by but hard to leave . the special breakfast burrito is delicious . the chilequiles are amazing . best horchata i have had . i would come back every day , if i could . will be recommending to all my friends and family !
1	had a super yummy steak quesadilla and everything was simply perfect ! the kids quesadillas were delicious . place is clean and super good service ! oh and don 't get me started on the tres leches it was amazing !
1	had the chubby checker . enough meat , veg and sauce fell out while i was eating it that i had dippin 's for the crispy flour tortilla chips that come with it , bonus for me ! it 's two , two , two meals in one ! although this sandwich was not a healthy choice ( by my choice ) , i 'll definitely eat here again so i can try something else .
1	hands down the best food i have had in arizona since i 've moved from cali . my family and i will most definitely being coming back . also , great service and there was not a long wait .
1	have gone here for years , is our favorite mexican food restaurant . tried something new , fiesta shrimp salad . oh my , so good .
1	authentic roasted poblano onion " chutney " dip for chips , home flavor salsa and delicious grill-warmed tortillas . the service by a young , cheerful lady was superior - far better than that from the staff at my five-star downtown hotel . i wish we san diegans had such truly home-made mexican cuisine .
1	the dish reminded me of being in mexico , with the free range eggs and fresh guacamole . simple decor and incredibly friendly staff . would definitely recommend !
1	i am usually extremely critical of mexican food because my mother is mexican , however , i can say the food here surpassed my expectations ! homemade tortillas were excellent , and shrimp dish was very flavorful . we ordered take-out and everything was as delicious as would be expected in the restaurant . sopesitos as an appetizer were perfect ! my husband ordered the enchiladas verdes , which he loved . we found our new favorite !
1	i ate there twice on my business trip - it was that good ! best salsa i 've had in a long time . the la tablita was deliscious , as wwere the carnitas . i loved the pickeled jalepones . i didn 't think the prices were bad for vegas either .
1	i can 't wait to come back . the food was amazing and fresh . try the bacon guacamole & the coconut plan !
1	i contacted chef gabe for having taste of new mexico out for our sky ancala community event , food truck tuesday , and the chef surpassed all expectations ! my party had one of each , and nobody had any complaints- and we had even less left over ! everyone 's plates were cleaned ! the chips and salsa accompaniments with the tacos and burritos stuffed with meat and cheese truly made this truck 's cuisine fantastic ! chef gabe has 100 % perfected the art of new mexican cuisine .
1	if you are looking for great tacos , do yourself a favor and stop in .
1	i had a double birthday party there for 50 people and they were fantastic . our service was great and their drinks are fantastic !
1	i had fish enchiladas that were filling and yummy . my friend had the taco salad . a great place for lunch . small though ... be prepared you may need to take out !
1	i had the chipotle chicken and wanted to bathe in it . huge portions , also . delicious chips and salsa . the tableside guacamole is the best i 've ever tasted . our waitress , amber was fantastic ! i can 't wait to try more of the menu .
1	i had the steak huarache , and loved it . their horchata is also great ( not to sweet ) . only downside to this place is the size , however , you can take out . all in all , one of the best mexican food places in champaign .
1	i had the tour of fuego--empanadas , salmon croquette , veggie tostada , and cubano slider . all were fabulous ! my friend enjoyed her quesadilla too . the " small plates " are actually a good size for one person 's meal . the entrees are huge !
1	i had the unfortunate circumstance of arriving here only a couple days after getting food poisoning on my way back to the us from egypt , so i had a tender belly and this would be my first major meal . i took the leap and got the trout entree and the smoked scallops to share with my wife , and both dishes were fantastic . deeply flavorful , with a balance of light and rich , creamy and crunchy , firm and soft , it was a wonderful meal to feel inspired to devour . i will definitely return here !
1	i had the vaca frita and my friends had the sautéed pork and chicken ! everything from the cuba libre to the yuca con mojo was fantastic ! highly recommended ! !
1	i have been craving fried plantains since returning from panama a few months ago , and theirs hit the spot . the restaurant was lively for a monday lunch hour . waitresses were super friendly and willing to answer questions . i had some chips with beans and cheese ready for me within minutes , and my totones ( fried plantains ) and papusas ( pollo and camarones ) were out within 15 minutes . everything was oh so great and can 't wait to come back for more ! !
1	i have never had anything like the flautas el paso before , but they are great ! and all at a reasonable price . i will absolutely be back .
1	i 'm a white dude from a mexican area . i 've eaten some of the best mexican food in the world in orange county and san diego . this place is just as good or better . their pastor is cut from pork tenderloin . absolutely phenomenal . carne asada fries are huge ! ! ! super tasty !
1	i 'm from jersey and these are the best tortillas i 've ever had ! ! ! !
1	i ordered the steak burrito . it came with a side of rice and beans , also with chips and salsa . i have a very big appetite and i had a hard time finishing this it was so big . cooked perfectly . smelled amazing and tasted even better . $ 10.95 for what i got was very inexpensive . i will definitely be eating here again .
1	i read that the other reviews complained about it being greasy , but i did not feel that way . having lived in latin american ( and on the mexican border ) , this brought me back memories . good memories . we did get there at 6 : 00 , and were told there was a 1.5 hour wait for 4 people , but we were seated before 7pm hit .
1	i recommend this place to everyone ! bombastic ! the rum flights are delicious and very educational . the tacos are fantastic . i recommend getting the tostones with pork . it was orgasmic . i love this place ! !
1	i tried the mahi mahi , the salmon and shrimp , and the pork and they were all great ! make sure you bring cash and be prepared to stand because it 's a small place . no complaints here though ! !
1	absolutely delicious i tried the pulled pork sandwich once so far the best i ever had better than the greasy southern us ones by far they have this hint of passion fruit in the sauce. yesterday i went back and had a steak it was juicy , the grill gives it extra flavour , their chimichurri is to die for and they give me an extra hot sauce which was absolutely great it had an orange color and fruity taste but it was spicy. the yucca fries were just amazing so crunchy and thick yet moist inside .
1	i used to go for lunch all the time , the burritos rock my face off . i haven 't been at night , but i 'd imagine that the ambiance and the margaritas would make for a spectacular experience . go ! ! you won 't regret it : )
1	i used to only be able to eat here when i was downtown at the camelback location . as soon as i saw the sign during construction i was elated ! their food is great , their customer service is top notch , and the energy is electric . thank you for finally building one a lot closer and more convenient to my home .
1	i 've been here many times , tried about half of the menu items and loved every one of them . the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu . this place is must on all my vegas trips .
1	i will definitely be going there again . the people are very friendly and the drinks are very yummy .
1	kind of difficult to spot , they could work on better signage but the door was amazing . i recommend the meatball appetizer ( my friend loves the corn ) and the chicken taco + the calamari were really good staff is really sweet , and their recommendations are great
1	warmly welcomed and looked after by erika and diego . yummy ' table constructed ' guacamole . awesome cooking by paco who 's flan was as great as we had heard . looking forward to coming back when next in vegas .
1	made to ordered goodness everything was so fresh . highly recommend the smoked chicken arepa and garlic shrimp !
1	generous portions and wonderful seasonings . be prepared for a relaxed pace and watch out for small bones , but the meal was extremely enjoyable . i would love to see the bastilla in an appetizer size , because it 's a little too sweet to make an entire meal . you might want to share it with a dining companion , which is what we did . we will definitely come back .
1	a few beers on tap , decent bottled beer and wine selection , and a respectable liquor selection with about ten chairs around a bar and two tvs . small to average sized menu ... everything was delicious and we just about tried it all . desserts were fantastic as well ! looking forward to the next visit !
1	all 4 flavors were incredible . living in la and at times mexico , i know a good authentic tamale and this is definitely it .
1	my boyfriend and i went here for lunch and i was impressed ! we each got three tacos . there was a line out the door but it was well worth it . get a churro ! !
1	my husband and i love checking out mexican restaurants where ever we go . this place is the real deal ! we tried several different things on the menu . the shrimp tacos were fantastic ! service was great . we will make a point of going back next time we are in vegas !
1	my husband lived in peru for a time , and coming here for pollo a la brasa just hit the spot ! great rice pudding and flan ! of course an inca cola ! yum ! just great !
1	ordered the 5 tacos for $ 6.95 or something like that and they were amazing ( two pork three steak ) . there is a salsa and hot sauce bar for you to add everything you would like on your tacos . the food was affordable and service was very very quick . must try this place !
1	our hotel concierge recommended this place and it did not disappoint . bf had the azteca enchiladas and i had the azteca burrito . both were very good . i didn 't care for the red ( mole ) sauce but the green sauce was perfect . even the chips and salsa were top notch . and service was amazingly fast even though it was packed . if / when we 're back in scottsdale , barrio queen will be a must visit restaurant !
1	pork belly taco appetizer was one of the best things i 've ever eaten , a must-try . great service too .
1	queso dip and black and blue quesadilla were delightful . highly recommend . for happy hour , you can 't beat the price .
1	sat on their patio which was very nice even though in a strip mall . the food was incredible . carne asada was top notch as were the tacos and enchilada . service was excellent but what really defines a mexican restaurant in my opinion is the chips and salsa . they were out of this world ! will definitely be back in the near future .
1	our server , rolando was very attentive and gracious . this was a great latin fusion restaurant with a modern ambience . the price is really good for the food quality
1	senor taco has a great atmosphere with friendly staff . i had the menudo and it was outstanding ! ! ! wide selection of authentic mexican dishes to choose from with very generous portions . i highly recommend ! ! !
1	simple , quick and authentic tasting . corn vs flour tortilla both delicious ( get four ! )
1	smothered chimichanga is out of this world . i ordered it xmas still . i took an order of churros to go and i wish i had enough for a month they are seriously some of the best i 've had . will definitely continue to go back
1	some of the best green chili i 've ever had ( and green chili is always my go to when eating mexican food ) . the taco was equally flavorful and delicious . can 't wait to go back ! !
1	definitely consider this if you 're looking for authentic mexican food with incredibly friendly staff
1	some of the best salsa i have ever had - different from most mexican spots . great guacamole as well as margaritas as well !
1	they 're ginormous , loaded with meat and cheese and made with soft , warm corn or flour tortillas . if you 're craving tacos , and cruising old town , this is the spot .
1	street tacos , yum ! fish taco , yes ! shrimp , oh yeah ! the rice and beans are even good ! we will definitely be back !
1	super friendly staff . you can tell they have many regulars , they know people by name and are very attentive . i want to say this .... i love mexican food and this is the very best . when i need some mexican food in my life from here on out this is where i will go . no exception . my waitress kristin was super friendly and efficient .
1	this is pretty much the authentic experience ( the main difference , of course , being that the meat is so plentiful , although that 's not surprising for american mexican food ) , tacos grilled right in front of you , a wide variety of seasonings . my only regret is that they 're so filling that i can only get one $ 2.50 taco at a time , so it 's taking me a long time to get through the flavors .
1	our waiter was great , and we loved that there was a dj ! we enjoyed our girls night out and stopping here was a great idea !
1	highly recommend if you 're looking for authentic mexican food at a very reasonable price ! ! !
1	had the brisket and the supreme chicken . a little expensive but you absolutely get what you pay for .
1	absolutely delicious tacos , with house made tortillas and the freshest ingredients .
1	the fried zucchini is the bomb and their burgers are juicy and packed with flavor . better than carls jr . and mickey ds
1	the jaz tacos are to die for . the flour tortillas are handmade and take me back to the 80s when tortillas tasted good , not the crappy tortillas you get now . no it 's not fancy , but it 's clean and the salsa bar has 4 salsas , shredded cabbage , radishes , etc . and best of all it is a great value . you will not be disappointed .
1	the service was excellent too . great prices on the different menu items . you won 't leave here disappointed !
1	this is a fun place to go while out and about in container park . while there aren 't many tables to sit at inside there are plenty offered outside . the carne asada fries were unreal .... staying fantastically crispy all the way to the end . the sopes were also amazing and fantastically crispy .
1	this is a great establishment . their prices are perfect unlike chipotle . here a very filling burrito will only cost $ 6.95 . the employees are nice . the restaurant is extremely clean . i will definitely be back for more ! ! !
1	three of us shared the mahi mahi , short rib barbacoa , and steak tacos ..... really incredible . the guacamole was good and the cucumber-jalepeno margarita was excellent !
1	we ordered a regular size pollo and asada .. it was the kind of meal where you 're full halfway through but you keep eating anyway because it 's so good . also , they have very unique and tasty salsas . we will be back for more !
1	tried both the tacos and the burrito . both were great but the barbacoa de res burrito was amazing . nice , clean , and friendly . so glad we stopped !
1	tried this with a friend since it sounded so unique and was pleasantly surprised . i ordered the flautas and i will definitely get them again . the staff was so friendly . must try .
1	tried two kinds of arepas , both of them were good . also had a shredded beef empanada . the meat was to die for . had a mango drink and plantains too . everything was great . i never had venezuelan food before . i can 't wait to come back .
1	try the queso bean dip ! i wish this place was closer to me so i could go all the time .... definitely go here for a casual lunch while you 're in vegas ! !
1	the waitress was helpful in making suggestions and a lot of fun to joke around with . the food was totally epic and memorable with good sized portions and not too expensive . it looks a lot like the location in mexico inside as well .
1	very simple small place . we would never find this place without yelp 's recommendation . thank you dear yelp ! chili relleno was so good i considered ordering another one - i wish i had an extra stomach . my husband ordered " birria " -a stew like dish with goat meat sweet fresh onion , cilantro and lime - also delicious . and it is also very inexpensive .
1	very unexpected we have eaten there various times and always satisfied !
1	we ate here for a rehearsal dinner and it was easily one of the best meals i have ever had in the city . service was fantastic , and the meat and potatoes were amazing . will definitely come back again !
1	we had the baked goat cheese ( to die for ) , crab cakes ( out of this world ) , the crispy duck leg ( delicious ) and the braised octopus ( good flavor , but not our thing ) . will definitely be back !
1	we had their shrimp tacos , tortilla soup , el gran combo salad , and tamal con huevos. everything we ate was amazing ! their ginger lemonade was refreshing . but the most amazing dish was their caramelo cake ! omg !
1	we had the kiss taco , the kiss papa taco , the quesadilla and rice and beans ! everything had that delicious homemade taste ! we loved everything ! and all the fresh salsas were fabulous too ! can 't wait to eat here again ! the friendly atmosphere made it even better ! we drove all the way from surprise , it 's totally worth the drive ! ! !
1	we happened to be in the area for an appt and decided to stop . the staff was so helpful and friendly and my carne asada chimichanga was heavenly . they have a chips and salsa bar which is a big hit . we will definitely be back .
1	we were first timers today and we were very pleased with the food . i had a carne asada , pork , and chicken taco and i am stuffed , so good . i recommend it to anyone ! ! go on taco tuesday or during happy hour when the tacos are cheaper ! !
1	not sure how there are reviews saying the food is " disgusting . " it is far from disgusting . yelp sucks but this place is great
1	wonderful family , and friendly service . the guacamole was made to order , with exactly what we wanted mixed in . every dish was absolutely yummy . whole family approved . everyone needs to visit this place ! ! ! !
1	ordered the nachos on happy hour with shredded beef which won the table over . tried the stacked blue corn enchiladas with beef as well which was excellent , also tried with pork and was somehow even better . highly recommend and will be back !
1	if you want to taste authentic ranchero cuisine this it . the secret is in their wood bbq for incredible flavor . so glad to have a local restaurant focused on healthy offerings , good prices , sublime cocktails and super friendly owners . try it out .
1	they serve them fresh off the grill with all the fixin 's ! they have serval fresh salsa and hot sauces too ! i love the food inside too ! great groceries !
1	the location , interior , food , service at this place is point . we ordered a bunch of tapas and all were so great . recommendations : the special spicy tuna and avocado , oxtail , paella ( make sure u put in the order as soon as u get drinks- take 45 min ) , and for dessert ... the churros are bomb . really great place . expect to drop a lot though cause it 's not exactly cheap , and you 're gonna wanna order a bunch of things . can 't wait to come by again !
1	got the carnita , in cod we trust , and some other fish taco . everything was amazing and i licked my fingers clean . the guac and chips were also great because the chips had a bit of spice to them ! we finished with palatas : i highly recommend the key lime pie . would 100 % return .
1	i seriously think i could eat here every day . the guys at the bar make amazing drinks and the menu will not disappoint ! the merlot braised short ribs was fantastic and we had a hard time deciding ! don 't miss the street corn !
1	dj in the background .... nice place . the different windows to order from gets getting used to . but overall great !

1	you cannot go wrong with any mesa grill ! our table had seafood , steak , lamb , and pork , everything was perfect . great service , great atmosphere and great food !

1	i don 't think i will ever want to eat at swiss chalet again ! absolutely delicious perfectly grilled marinated chicken ! we took advantage of the family meal combo and decided to order the peruvian salad and yuca fries both were fantastic and i definitelyprefer the yuca over normal potato french fries ! so crispy and delicious ! it came with two kinds of hot sauce both are so tasty with the perfect amount of heat for me ! we met the owner and his family who run the restaurant and they were lovely people and extremely accommodating ! i can 't wait to go back again !
1	food came out quick and everything was delicious . my new favorite mexican restaurant . impressed for how new they are . i 'll be back for sure .
1	our waiter went above and beyond to make sure the food was as ordered and tasty . next to us was sitting a very rude customer , he was dropping the f bomb left and right , being extremely demanding and yet , the waitress was extremely polite dealing with a customer who was extremely obnoxious . go check them out , you 'll love it !
1	first time in , i had the country fried burger and it was soooo delicious . also tried the lucky charm marshmallow shake , freaking amazing . i 'll be coming here at least once a week , every week
1	i had the chimichanga with steak and my husband had the burrito mexicano . both were very good and i don 't think i 've ever had a better chimichanga in my life ! the horchada is also very creamy and flavorful . our new mexican restaurant favorite !

1	got tacos with lengua , cabeza , and all pastor and they were all perfect . so many places have mediocre lengua , but this was flavorful and moist . same with the cabeza . frankly , the al pastor was better than perfect ; the marinade had a deep southwestern red chili flavor . it was a little too intense for my wife , but i loved it . go here !
1	you will not find the traditional sushi snob and confusing menu but a friendly flavorful fusion on a perfect mexican style sushi ,
1	im from namiquipa chihuahua and the food is spot on . handmade tortillas , chiles from chihuahua and cheese from where i grew up . hard to find an authentic restaurant but this little spot is amazing . try the tripas and taco chihuas .

1	i was in las vegas on business and i don 't like to eat at the " tourist " style food stops on the strip . i had the shrimp el fish taco costra and the el fish taco . both were obviously made fresh and were absolutely delicious ! the staff was extremely nice and the food was outstanding ! i would highly recommend a visit when in the las vegas area !
1	i 'm a texan and this is in my top 3 places . you have to get a beef taco !

1	wonderful , friendly and courteous service . great food , great prices and a fantastic little salsa bar . seriously , all of the sauces and sauces are to die for . highly recommended for any lunch or takeout dinner . me and the wife had a selection of a lot of what they offer and everything 's been fantastic . crispy juicy fish and amazing shrimp . * edit : also the place is spotless ^ _ ^
1	there is no need to get mexican food somewhere else it will only be disappointing compared to los chiludos .

1	i 'm here for a couple weeks for work and they have been great . thank you ! !
1	the wait for the food isn 't long and the staff are really friendly . i 've been a regular customer and would definitely recommend this place if someone is looking for good , healthy and quick meals .
1	it 's plainly evident upon walking in how traditionally the food is prepared . the staff was extraordinarily friendly , and the tacos were downright delicious . kiss and papa tacos were big hits . word to the wise : the salsa is great but very hot , and for picky eaters their variety is not huge . thanks kiss for some fond phoenix memories !
1	if i am ever back in town in charlotte , i will definitely go again . i highly recommend this restaurant .
1	we had the pork pastor which was unbelievable and the steak quesadilla which was great . i would highly recommend this restaurant for mexican food fans ! quick service and very friendly staff as well .

1	definitely worth giving it a try . perfect location as well .

1	drinks were never empty , table never dirty , fast service . amazing customer service , great atmosphere . i would definitely recommend .
1	taco tuesday was a success ! if you haven 't tried the coconut margarita i highly suggest you ask jeremy to make you one ! ! he 's an awesome bartender ! oh , and the carne asada tacos ( they were sooo delicious ! ) we will be back ! !
1	amazing tacos and great presentation . the outside environment is very welcoming and chill . great place to go if you want some good food and are willing to spend some money , great bang for your buck
1	came in for latte and decided to try a burrito . the rooster is hands down the best burrito ever ! ! ! highly recommend . the coffee was perfect ! ! perfect roast , no bitterness , no burnt taste . just perfect morning made possible by these beautiful ladies !
1	and i come from a european family . not fast because it 's all fresh , the value is incredible as everything is huge .
1	first timers in toronto , this restaurant recommendation came from a friend who visits often for work . we had a 9 : 15pm reservation on a saturday night and we were seated immediately upon arrival . began with a cocktail ( the hopeless mermaid ) and is was perfect for a warm evening . now for the food .... this is very much a sharing menu , so we asked the waiter for some highlights and took his advice . here is what you cannot miss- soppressata with shaved foie gras and honey sea bream ceviche tomato salad with anchovies what you could probably skip - calamari the atmosphere was lovely . worth every penny .
1	the green chile is homemade and the reason i drove 6 miles . breakfast is also stupendous . the prices are so cheap i typically tip 50 % because they deserve it . literally hands down best mexican food i have had in arizona . dont judge a book by its cover . the outside is no ritz but the ritz could learn a thing or two from the chef .
1	i 've tried hundreds of taco spots but this al pastor ranks among the best i 've ever had .
1	very friendly and food is out of this world . best ceviche i have ever had- and you can design your own- octopus / shrimp with a slight mango flavor and incredible heat- like nothing i 've ever seen . great paella , authentic south american drinks , and lots of fun .
1	my man and i came here one morning for breakfast and unfortunately by the time we got there , they were out of bunuelos . i ordered the chilaquiles and my man ordered the chorizo burrito . my chilaquiles were perfect - juxtaposing textures of crunchiness and warm decadent sauce , traditional spices , a runny egg . the chorizo burrito was packed with mouthwatering flavor and freshness . we also ordered a caramel iced coffee , which was bold and smooth . i love simple menus where anything you pick is a winner . nothing overdone , everything as it should be .
1	the chicken is so flavorful and the staff is so friendly . everything is so well run especially for it being so new . i totally recommend the stuffed avocado with chicken . it 's not something you can get most places and it 's heavenly . they also have incredible chorizo which is pretty hard to find . make sure to top your dinner off with the tres leches . it 's the best cake i 've ever had hands down . can 't wait to see this business grow ! !
1	the service was quite incredible , the food was outstanding ! the owner and staff were very personable making the experience perfect ! the owner recommended the " costra lobster tacos " which were out of this world ! they grill cheese and wrap it around the meat and put it in a warm tortilla with their signature sauce ! best thing is the value of their menu is affordable and delicious ! ! very thankful i stumbled apon this place and look forward to our future visits !
1	to die for . my mouth waters just thinking about the food . don 't let the outside scare you away . probably the best food i 've had my entire life .
1	meat so tender . tortillas are fresh . i am happy happy happy . we will definitely be back again i promise that . you have won me over chipotle anyday . about a 4 mile drive but well worth it .
1	amazing food , best mimosas ever , and the people who work there are the friendliest you 've ever met . can 't wait to come back again and again . love the fact that the owners are so friendly and hands on . couldn 't think of a single thing to make this place better .
1	great atmosphere , great food , great service ! never have i had a bad experience going here , and would highly recommend checking it out if you get the hankering for the best tacos in pittsburgh . i would highly recommend the chicken tacos , they 're to die for
1	has the best mexican cuisine in pittsburgh hands down . it 's a gem on the square . i love their handmade chips and fresh salsa . i 'm forever convincing friends to try this place out . i always order their breaded shrimp tacos . their happy hour has reasonably priced margaritas ! ! i 've been here many times and only once have i had a mediocre experience . most of the time the staff is friendly and attentive . the atmosphere makes me feel like i 'm somewhere else .
1	what a great happy hour ! i met a good friend there and we both had a spicy margarita ... ok , we had more than one ! i had 3 tacos and cannot decide on my favorite ... ok , the mole ! hahaha i 'm really bad at making decisions ! considering celebrating my birthday here next month ... that 's how much i loved it !
1	great service , my glass was never empty , staff was very friendly . portions of the meal was very filling . and the food was reasonably priced . this is a must go to for the family and friends .
1	the huevos rancheros , chile verde , shrimp cocktail , and menudo ( it 's a secret menu item ! ) are all top notch ! ! this place is totally worth the money .
1	try mixing the short rib with the cornbread for a sweet and smokey flavor in your enchiladas . first time in , but definitely not my last . good value for the quality .
1	absolutely love burrito boyz .. i have become an addict and had it two weekends in a row .. one rolled burrito and the next time i got a naked burrito .. love the food and their quick service !
1	great local tap beers and wonderful shrimp tacos . i would recommend the grilled shrimp over the fried , but that all comes down to preference . i hear it can get pretty busy on a friday / saturday night so i would suggest going for lunch or on a week night . if you don 't mind a crowd then go anytime !
1	it was delicious and very good portions , service was excellent and staff very friendly i will definitely be back . our total was $ 175 that included 2 entrees with a $ 3 sauce , 2 sides , and 3 cocktails we celebrated a birthday and tried the blackberry bunt cake , really good too .
1	such an unexpected gem in mississauga . real authentic mexican food ! and huuge portions . the tacos were to die for . the service was great . 120 % going back asap !
1	my boyfriend and i shared tuna tartare and ceviche for appetizers . we polished them off . we both ordered tacos . i got 2 , he got 3 . they were amazing ! he also got a mojito . he said it was good . only drawbacks are we had to wait about 30 minutes to get a table ( it 's a small establishment ) , it was very loud and the table we got was by the window and cold air was getting through . prices were reasonable and food was absolutely delicious . i asked my boyfriend if we could go back in a couple weeks . definitely plan on being regulars here . i recommend this great restaurant !
1	salsas were delicious ! i had the sunday pozole , definitely coming back for more !
1	just seemed like a never ending line for lunch ... however the extremely helpful and friendly staff here made up for the wait ... i also highly recommend the twin dragon and the angry tuna ! both huge portions and fresh as can be !
1	we both had the special . it consisted of a shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada . the refried beans melted in your mouth and the sauce on the enchilada was so delicious ! the beef taco was tasty and fresh . the service was excellent ! they kept our chips and salsa bowls full and refilled our drinks when empty . next time i am in the area , i will make it a point to come back and eat there again !
1	so many unique margarita flavors , and the goat cheese guacamole was to die for ! the beef short rib tamales were another hit ! everything was delicious , our server was so friendly , great experience . great happy hour specials too ! i hope to come back every time i 'm visiting cleveland !
1	drinks were also very good . hibiscus martini was phenomenal and strong . our meals were tacos ( the lunch special ) with beans and rice . i had the yucatan chicken taco which was delicious . chicken was juicy and flavorful . it had a bit more spice than i expected . we were very satisfied and pleased with our lunch . we will go back .
1	we actually ended up getting 5 tapas to share between two people instead of any main courses . the queso fundido , camarones , and salmon ceviche were incredible ! ! also got the empenadas and guac / chips ( the usual ) which were also good ( but not as great as the others ) . the tres leches cake and dulce / horchata ice cream were equally as amazing , as were the unique cocktails ! would def recommend !
1	great food , friendly staff . we had the steak special , which was tender and full of flavor , as well as the chicken mole , also outstanding and authentic . the salsa and guacamole were both made with fresh ingredients and the flavors really popped . the only downfall is that the hours as reported on yelp are incorrect , which has burned us a few times now . be sure to call in advance and don 't rely on yelp for hours of operation .
1	so cute inside ... our server jose made the visit so enjoyable . food was gooooood ! loved the chips sprinkled with chili and the guac was fabulous . we had the el patron for two . filet and ribeye grilled and served with fresh tortillas and 3 amazing sauces .. and the most amazing potatoes . we will definately be back . soon .
1	all the ingredients from the meats , to the sides , to the original drinks , and even the salsas had such a fresh taste to them . peruvian food is typically bland , but viva chicken has done an excellent job of adding bold flavor without losing authenticity . my family is peruvian and i cannot wait for them to try this place !
1	way better than all that buffet food ! ! !
1	chips and salsa rocked , the enchiladas were awesome and i loved , loved , loved their rice ! service was excellent as was the ambience . we wanted a nice comfortable place to converse , and most places you have to talk over loud music .... not here - ambience was perfect !
1	first off , the place has a great ambiance to it . small and cozy . we had the guacamole as an app and it didn 't disappoint . my margaritas were on par as well . had the chorizo veggie tacos and they were honestly some of the most flavorful tacos i 've ever tasted . i love how they let you construct the tacos however you like . you can make them as spicy or mild or medium . whether your just visited toronto or live close by give this place a try . you won 't be disappointed .
1	our food was delicious - i had a few things off the vegan menu and then we shared the vegan choc cake . the chips before our meal were awesome too which was a surprise bc they weren 't greasy at all . everything was truly amazing ! we also really loved our server manny . great guy , very attentive and helpful with all of my question ! next time we go back to vegas , this is the only place i 'll eat ! : )
1	popped in shortly before they were closing but the service was still great ! mega friendly staff , huge range of choices on there menu and lots of vegetarian options ! not to mention a cute , trendy looking place !
1	prices are fair and not outrageous at all . i can 't speak highly enough of the staff and how friendly and courteous they were . the food tasted great and the location of the restaurant was very easy to find ; it 's right by the pool at the rio . great food and service , great prices , and an awesome location ! keep up the great work guys !
1	true to its roots and a little taste of mexico ! their fuego taco with cheese and anaheim pepper was delicious . cheap and so worth every bite !
1	what a find . thank you yelp reviewers . terrific flavors without the oversized platter full of forgettable sauce / gravy covering everything ! each item stands by itself with unique sauce / flavoring . my favorite test of a mexican menu is the basic cheese & onion enchilada , and theirs is definitely a home run ! this will be a " must stop " every time i visit phoenix .
1	great service , ambiance , and the food ..... amazing . your meal comes out as it is ready . that works well for me , because i 'm not a patient person . we ordered snapper , three bean salad , flat bread and several other dishes . all were absolutely delicious . you can 't go wrong . check it out !
1	the chips and salsa were good . empanada was nice and crispy . my entree , encocado de camaron , was very well seasoned and had some indian influence . loved the plantain crisps that came with it . definitely will return !
1	it 's a close as it gets to eating an authentic mexican taco .
1	best mexican hotdogs and their carne asada is delicious too . so flavorful ! they have a lot of their toppings on the side so you can choose how much of which toppings you want on your dog . the guacamole is yummy ! the owner is very friendly and was greeting everyone ( that 's something you don 't see everyday ) . they came from tucson and the new place looks great ! so happy that they have a phoenix location now ! i will definitely be visiting often ! more often than i probably should ; ) thanks el guero !
1	great margaritas , food & staff ! atmosphere is awesome . the lady making the fresh tortillas right in front is great to watch her preform her craft . highly recommend
1	got the steak sandwich with a side of the empanadas . i 'd been wanting to try their empanadas for awhile but towards the end of the week they sometimes run out . but not this time ! unfortunately i found the empanadas a bit on the salty side , so i 'm not sure i 'd get them again . however , the steak sandwich was fabulous . the bread was wonderfully crunchy and the meat was done perfectly . i 'm already looking forward to my next visit !
1	the food is great , the employees are nice and it 's a clean atmosphere !
1	prices have gone up in the last few years but still worth it . jerk chicken is the only way to go .
1	.the most authentic and incredible mexican food i 've ever had in las vegas hands down ! ! the place is so beautiful and colorful . the food is sooo good.their tacos are freaking amazing ! ! everything is so exquisite and delicious . will definitely be coming back here . manager chad was very attentive and stopped by a couple of times making sure we were having great time ! great suggestions , great atmosphere , very friendly and helpful staff ! a + + +
1	both times i 've been there , the service has been good , staff has been laid back yet attentive , and the food ? exactly what the doctor ordered ! excellent margs , a nice deviation from your basic margarita , but nothing too bizarre or fancy . great tacos ( check out $ 2 taco tuesday ! ) , and truly inspired flavor and ingredient combinations . definitely worth a return visit , and another , and another .
1	once again a fabulous dinner . i take friends and family here when they visit from out of town . they always insist on having lola 's when they come again . my in laws were not let down this time either . thanks lola 's !
1	one of my favorite mexican restaurants in arizona . i always get their adovada ribs . their food is amazing but packs quite a powerful punch . ( spicy )
1	excellent flavor and close to home . the beans and carne asada are out of this world great ! ! i would pick alfonsos over los any day .
1	however the only thing i 've ever gotten from here is their bean and cheese burrito , and a taco . the taco wasn 't the best , but their beans are amazing . i love the service here too , they are always friendly .
1	the food is delicious and made to order . the space is small and busy , so be prepared to wait ... especially on the weekend . they have a large tequila / margarita menu ... so be ready for some good drinking . the waitstaff is super friendly and proficient . if you want good authentic mexican food then this is the place for you .
1	go here maybe once or twice a week . they have this cucumber drink , must try . it has lime , cucumber and pineapple in it . delicious ! very yummy tortas and soup as well . not been disappointed . ...
1	their food is delicious ! i only wish they had a slightly bigger place- the seating is really crammed . i also wish they delivered . i 've always tried some of the non-alcoholic drinks that they keep and they 're all worth a shot .
1	i used to come when it was revo burrito . its been my favorite for years . when they changed their name and remodeled location i was afraid too much would change but it was a great upgrade . their service is great too . my favorite is the chicken fajita bowl . it is so delicious . their traditional margaritas are the best . everyone must try ! ! !
1	no one does burritos like they do , they do simple real good and over the years quality has never gone down on flavor or serving . they are the perfect example of doing something great really really well and maintaining their standards .
1	the atmosphere is what makes the place my favorite- the cozy , funky , warm environment of sharing small plates throughout the night encourages conversation and sparks smiles ! ! : ) this is always my # 1 go to spot !
1	the back patio is so nice and spacious . they have little tables for kids and all the tables are easy to move if you have a big group . i wasn 't overly impressed with any of the salsas at all . and it took about 20 minutes for 4 street tacos to come out . but the tacos were great ! today was our first time here so we tried one of each . chicken , carne asada , and al pastor . i 'd definitely recommend al pastor . it was delicious ! ! ! !
1	i get it almost every time . the pork stew is really good and my husband really enjoyed the chili relleno . great mexican food and a wonderful patio , lots of umbrellas .
1	even though the menu doesn 't have many labeled vegan items , i have never experienced anything less than the most accommodating staff here . they go out of their way to ensure you are taken care of and have a delicious and memorable dining experience . i 've been multiple times and have been surprised with delicious new creations every time . as a vegan diner with food allergies , finding a place that goes above and beyond to accommodate diet restrictions is huge and border grill does just that !
1	the margaritas are very good , service is consistently good and staff is super nice . we are locals and this is one of our favorite places to eat .
1	as a venezuelan , totally recommend this place . the arepas are on the small side , but the fillings are delicious . last time i went they even had papelón con limón ( my favorite from when i was a kid ) . i can 't ever miss this spot every time i go to vegas now . keep it up !
1	some of the options sound a little weird at first , but everything tastes great ! i have been back many , many times to try out different combinations of enchiladas . my personal favorite is combo of a spinach / mushroom enchilada and a cornbread enchilada . it is very crowded at lunchtime , but the service is quick . if you order take-out , you 'll be on your way in just a few minutes . for eating in , i recommend stopping by in the early evening .
1	the drinks are tasty as well. service seems hit or miss and the restaurant is a little cramped but worth putting up with because the food is so good .
1	lunch and dinner menus are both awesome ! best dessert ever ! had the tahitian a pearl !
1	this is new restaurant and they are already making a name for themselves. the location isnt the best for the upscale food and environment they create but a safe location and that is all that matters . pro- the food is fresh with all fesh ingredients . everything is made from scratch so you can def taste the difference . they are very clean and serve liquor. my fav- the chili relleno . con- the parking lot is too small and awkward . also , they do catering but the price for catering service doesnt seem to match the price of the plates so it is more than you would expect. once you try their food you may think it is worth it . sooo yummy !
1	try the grilled corn and $ 1.75 carne asada tacos ! deb 's doing a video review about the gluten free options- all the tacos use corn tortillas. http : / / www.deborahapeters.com and check out the urinals so corny and fun .
1	happy hour every day so come early to get a good spot ! the crunchy tacos are the best ! try the house margarita too ! will deff be heading here at least 2-3 times a month for happy hour !
1	only had rubios for the first time 2 months ago . i work near this location and even during lunch im out of the office get my food and back to the office in literally 11 min . fast service .
1	burritos , both bañados and dry , are delicious too . i like the nachos too . think i 'm trying to say that i like everything here . to top it off , the people at mi casita are seriously the friendliest restaurant employees ever . i like this place and it likes me .
1	the refried beans are pretty good , too . fiance loves their carne asada , and i think it 's pretty good , too , but i just can 't shake the pastor addiction ! oh , and i love america 's corn - covered in mayo , cotija cheese , and served with lime !
1	haven 't tried anything else on the menu because of my taco addiction .
1	we have never had a bad experience . we come here basically every weekend when we get off of work . since it 's late at night there are few places with decent fresh good food ... of you are looking for some great tacos . come here ! ! ! salsa is a little hot some times . yikes
1	the salsa had great spice . especially liked the green chile verde tamales . rice and beans are a must .
1	everything is always delicious and everyone is always so friendly . definitely becoming a weekly tradition .
1	this is the place to go for homemade food . they have two salsas , i prefer the very spicy salsa and the rest of family prefers the chunky salsa . i love the enchilada 's with red sauce . if you save room for dessert they make great sopapillas with honey and butter , delicious ! ! ! theresa always makes us feel like family when we go .
1	the staff was extremely nice , the ambiance was amazing and the food was delicious ! my girls and i had the shrimp ceviche , king crab tacos , short rib skewers and they were the perfect appetizers . my blood orange margarita was the perfect drink to complement the food ! the churro with vanilla ice cream was the most delightful dessert that i 've had in a long time ... so much so , that we ordered two ! ! definitely coming back soon ! ! !
1	been recommending this place to family and friends since my first visit ! ! ! oh and get the carne asada ! delish ! ! ! !
1	always great for a quick , cheap lunch . service is fast . we wanted a good lunch before a movie at gvr and didn 't want fast food . went here and was fed and out the door in a half an hour . lunch specials are fantastic , my favorite is the green chile pork and bean burrito .
1	amazing burritos and tacos . also some of the best horchata ! food is served hot and fresh . they also have a great salsa bar ! i usually get the carne asada burrito , sometimes tacos . but also be sure to try their specialty potato !
1	every single time i come in this woman is working her ass off . never have i walked in and seen her not being productive , just wanted to let it be known how much she 's appreciated .
1	super trendy and the food is divine . must go
1	they have 3 separate lines to order from so pay attention to what 's on the menu in each line so you don 't waste your time . i had the pastor , carne asada , and buche tacos , and an asada mula . everything was delicious . i came during the day on a friday and it wasn 't too crowded but i can imagine at night thus place gets packed .
1	we got the mexican pizza ( white chicken and cheese ) which was to die for . it was unique and extremely flavorful . we sat at the bar , but the ambiance would be worth having a sit down dinner . i have also heard that the pollo con queso is one of the best things on the menu and hope to try it next time !
1	any time i have a meeting dt i schedule it around having lunch here ! the skewers , veggie and fish tacos are all amazing ! i love sitting at the counter and chatting with the chefs . the staff is so warm and welcoming , you get the opportunity to talk to everyone . the space is small with a great patio . i cannot wait to try everything on the menu . oh and they have happy hour all day ! please open is south scottsdale asap ! !
1	can 't go wrong with anything on the menu . jade chicken and machaca combo are my favs , can 't get this anywhere else . pepsi products .
1	beef burrito and cheese burrito are my fave , only thing i 've ever had . why change a good thing ? lol been here throughout the years . always call and get it to go .
1	every time im on tha west side i have to make a stop at cafe zamora
1	been going there for years and there 's not a single person i wouldn 't recommend it to . the other location .. not so much . this one is always exceptional . have had 2 problems in the past 12 years i 've been going here and both were fixed professionally and in a timely manner . incredible .
1	best $ 2.50 tacos i 've had in a long time = d recommended the chicken tacos . i will be back before i know it . extra tip .... hard to find parking depending on the time of day .
1	bring friends here once a week . not your standard mexican fare . great food , have tried most menu items . highly recommend the habanero wings and jalapeno margarita . service is timely and friendly . you really can 't go wrong . this is quite the underrated gem .
1	casual atmosphere , reasonable prices , delicious chicken and the homemade hot sauce is too good ! ! ! the bala bala or homemade round fries are soo good . i 've also tried the beef skewer which is good too . my collegues also like to try the grilled squid and battered cod . it 's close to my work and provides a chill no fuss atmosphere , my manager knows all the staff by name now . the hot sauce i was told is a secret family recipe and only 4 people know it ! ! ! i recommend o patio
1	decided to forgo breakfast at the hotel and test my luck at the airport . i wanted to be able to sit down and be served - versus a mcdonald 's ! really cute atmosphere- hip and the music is lively . great service from christina ! the food was excellent . i had the bacon egg and mexican cheese burrito . it is a large portion and served with a side of potatoes . the fresh salsa is what really ties it all together . now i just need to be located on a mexican beach somewhere ! will definitely come here again when i travel through phx .
1	definitely the best margarita in town . i really enjoy their special tacos on fridays-shrimp tacos- my favorite . great service , never ever a bad experience .
1	endless chips and salsa , great drinks , great atmosphere , and overall good mexican food . i had the enchiladas suizas with the tomatillo sauce . the tomatillo sauce is nice and light , which is the way i like it so it doesn 't overpower the taste of the meat and tortillas underneath it . the sour cream adds an additional creaminess that i really enjoyed . the service is top notch just like most other places in the lv strip . the bartenders seemed to be well trained and were very attentive . the servers were always around making sure we were doing ok . i would definitely recommend stopping by for dinner a few drinks before hitting the strip for a night out .
1	even for the non-meat eater you have options . mikey , the manager is always friendly and in a very good mood . the food is fantastic and the portions and price are fair . make sure you have your entire party together before going since you order in a line and then pick out a table , instead of table service .
1	everyone needs to come here an eat ! ! amazing customer service an most of all amazing food ! ! highly recommend this place to anyone who loves mexican food .
1	everything is so fresh and homemade ! it 's wonderful that i can get the tacos in jicama instead of the tortilla . prime rib tacos are beyond delicious ! the carne asada loaded nachos are sinfully good ! ever since the first time i 've eaten here i have been back at least once a week and i always bring someone new and they always love it too ! do yourself a favor try this ! ! !
1	every time we are in tucson we eat there , so glad they moved one to phoenix ! ! owner is usually present and walks around talking to customers and showing his appreciation for his establishment .
1	fabulous food , fabulous service and fabulous ambiance . tasty sangria drinks , the white sangria was especially good because it wasn 't too sweet . ordered the crispy duck , surf and turf skewerers , camarones all ajillo , bacon wrapped dates , ahi tuna with mango , ham and cheese croquettes and every single tapas dish was delightful ! only complaint is that it was a bit dark in the restaurant so we couldn 't really see what we were eating .

1	food is amazing , staff treats you like family . friendly atmosphere for family 's with kids .
1	food is fresh and made well . i do find that occasionally it is over salted . but if you ask for no salt they are okay with that request . order the king tacos . super delicious and the fresh veggies that come on the plate are so welcome to an already great meal . the agua frescas are always yummy . it is very busy . but if you go at a off time it 's easy to get in .

1	great food and service with a real downtown toronto kinda feel . tried it the first time with a travelzoo coupon and they now have us hooked . we always find another couple to go with us and really make a night of it . after dinner we often sit around and drink and they never rush you out . almost always the date night spot we choose . a real gem in the heart of downtown whitby .
1	i am a vegetarian so have only tried a couple dishes out here . love the salsas . have already recommended this place to my frnds ! !
1	i get the same thing every time ... the carne asada burrito . best ever ! ! !
1	i have always been sketchy about food trucks / stands . but this one takes it . their meat is always well seasoned . the taco trucks i have tried have either been too salty or too dry . this taco stand is my favorite by far . and what better than to have home made tortillas ! i am a regular customer and have never been disappointed in their food . they are very nice ppl and will always make sure our order is correct . i also like that we can add our own topping . they always have a " help yourself " refried beans pot as well . definitely recommend to any taco lover out there
1	i love all of them . new york and florida . what really brings me to here is the sangria and chafua rice .
1	i stop by to get my guacamole and cuban rum glazed pull pork every time i am in town from ca . great , friendly service !
1	i stopped in on my lunch break yesterday and had the carne asada torta and it was incredible , the service was the best i can recall in a long time and the price was not at all bad . i went in again for lunch today and ordered the carne asada burrito . phrank warned me it wouldn 't be as good as the torta , but i beg to differ ! i enjoyed the burrito twice as much and this is now one of my favorite spots in las vegas !
1	it 's loud , but it makes for a fun party atmosphere , and would be a great place to start any night on the town . love the concept of japanese tapas , and every single thing we got was very good , and served perfectly . good cocktails as well !
1	it 's normally pretty busy but you won 't be in line that long . there 's about 6-7 people in the front where you order so once you 're up it goes by quick . i remembered when this place first opened and thinking how cool it was that it was like a subway or chipotle but for pizza ! so cool ! anyway if you haven 't been totally worth going too . super adorable and it 's a very cute and rustic looking place .
1	it 's quick , easy & delicious ! everything i have had so far has been amazing . you will not be disappointed . the chicken is delicious and you have to get the sauces ! always order the empanadas ! and ask about the soup - it changes daily . i 've ha a few different soups here and they were all delicious .
1	its really good food at a really good price . the service is fast and the staff is friendly ! my favorite item is the beef green chili burro and the burracho burro . love the chips and salsa you get when you get there . free refills on drinks too !

1	i 've been coming here since i found out about it from an airport employee 8 years ago . always consistently good !
1	i 've been going for a year or so now , and every time the food is fantastic . the steak sandwiches are their main gig , but i highly recommend the braised beef sandwich as well . the sides are delicious and the outdoor seating is perfect . great job , guys !
1	i 've been to all of their locations including the new taco & beer place and i have always gotten great service , and even better food and drinks ! you have to try the lamb . i usually don 't care for lamb but love theirs . it 's a perfect place to go before or after you hit the strip for your night out . maybe they 've gotten some bad press but considering that i 've taking my family and friends there with me for two years and never experienced anything bad i have to say theirs might actually be a case where mistakes were made but were fixed and learned from . i 'll be going back again , and again .
1	i wish there was one closer to tempe . i would recommend the chorizo burrito ( freakin delicious ) ! ! ! the guy taking my order said it was one of his favorites , so i thought i 'd try it . it did not disappoint . everything else on the menu is excellent too . love the chicken marinated in green chili !
1	lunch fajitas , half shrimp and steak veggies well done . love it ! i do each business lunch i can here . and then come myself again for dinner . the owners , terry and his sister are the best people ever . i always see them there helping out and creating smiles . jeff w. audi north scottsdale .
1	me and my husband have been coming here for years . the staff is friendly and attentive and the food is delicious . the prices may shock you at first but all the produce and meat is well sourced and the portions are quite large so you really get what you pay for . we always make sure to try at least one new thing off the menu whenever we go and are never disappointed . the food is always fresh and bright and completely satisfying and the close , intimate setting always reminds us of my husband 's mother 's kitchen . a great hidden gem and a must try in the city . it 's definitely worth a walk along queen street .
1	my husband and i have eaten here 3 different times and the food is excellent ! even better , the staff is vey friendly and attentive ! as a person who works in the service industry , this place takes it to the next level . : )
1	new favorite restaurant for authentic mexican food . it also comes with really delicious sopa . the service was amazing , too . the facility was clean and quaint ; i can definitely see how maddening and crazy this place could get during a meal rush . you definitely have to try this place ; you 'll love it ! i promise .
1	only complaint i have would be the tortillas used to be thick and fluffy and now are pretty flat . but other than that this place is amazing .
1	small hole in the wall taco shop and its to die for . quick cooks , big bag of tacos for relatively cheap , and a salsa bar which lets face it is crucial . when i 'm craving street tacos this is the only choice .
1	staff is always friendly , the food is amazing ! especially their chicken enchiladas and albondigas . their fried ice cream is some of the best i 've ever had too .
1	staff is amazing and food is to notch . fajitas are my favorite followed closely by anything with shredded beef !

1	the food is always fresh & tastes wonderful . never eaten in , always ordered take-out , but it 's very reasonably priced , and if you have any dietary restrictions , they take great care of you ! tony is always a gentleman as well . highly recommend for all to try ! the bassa is incredible , love the sautéed calamari & the chips are delightful !
1	the food is amazing and super filling . the amount you pay and the amount of food you get is worth it . i would definitely recommend cabo fish taco to others and i would go again !
1	the food is amazing and the staff is very friendly . i usually don 't eat burritos but when i first tried it here i couldn 't help but to finish it all . the price is amazing and the food even better . if you have ten chance you definitely have to give this plans a try .

1	the owners are friendly and go out of their way to make their customers happy . the corn is the best i 've ever had and the tacos are amazing . reasonable prices and generous portions . don 't let the fact that this place is inside a gas station fool you , the food is fresh and the kitchen ( visible from the counter ) is clean . they have a little something for every taste so i highly recommend them the next time you have a mexican food craving !
1	the parsley nachos are to die for . i 'm here about once a week and have all my contacts workers hooked on it !

1	the pulled pork sandwich is amazing . their sauces are excellent ! love the location , just afraid they will get too popular !

1	the atmosphere is festive , the view 's are stunning day or night , the staff are so friendly and efficient , and the food is outstanding ! ! its our go-to place for all special occasions , especially birthdays . the mariachi plays the guitar while everyone sings and you get a free churro dessert . if i have one complaint , is the red salsa is not user friendly . i like a more mild , tomatoey salsa .
1	the owners continue to be inventive with the menu yet you can always get a delicious standard ( mine is the sweet potato / back bean burrito ) . i love that they locally source ingredients whenever possible . whenever guests are in from out of town , taco tontos and ray 's are always where we go . these two restaurants are kent treasures . thank you to all of the staff for the good energy you put into the food and for the vibe you create in the restaurant .

1	far and away the best . beautiful build out , friendly , efficient staff and , in case i failed to mention , amazing tacos , ceviche , posole , salsa , beer and cocktails . you will immediately abandon your other " favorite " taco place !
1	currently here as i type and this is my 3rd weekend in a row coming to this spot . obsessed with the mini quesadillas . all for a sweet price too i definitely recommend this as a place if you 're out after midnight and want a late night snack . thanks for making my weekends something to look forward to !

1	i 'm tempted not to write this so i don 't have to wait for my food . but the wait was more then worth it and if you 'd like to have real tacos , not what you 'd get at the bell , and for not much more you got to try this place . excellent food and service . i am so looking forward to returning and trying other menu items . and to be real the tacos aren 't big so 3 makes a nice lunch when added to the freshly made guacamole . 2 of us had 2 real mexican cokes , guac , and 5 tacos for $ 19 .
1	i 'm really glad the new owners took over and delivered such high quality tacos , from the meat to the salsa -- it 's all to perfection . this place is without a doubt going to become a " must have " destination in lv for mexican tacos and i was here before all of you !
1	we ordered drinks that were also really good ! we sat at the bar area & they were just so nice and accommodating ! ! ! my fiancé had the combo platter with a chimichanga , enchilada and taco . i had the combo with crunchy chille . both plates were delicious !
1	food is great and we always receive prompt service . don 't let the outside deter you away , as the the inside is nice and welcoming . definitely recommend trying this place out !

1	i 've never had a bad meal or drink from there . the staff is amazing and food is better than any place around ! they have great happy hour specials but prices are extremely reasonable all day long too . it doesn 't get any better than barcelona ! !

1	great food and even better views . we watched a lightning storm from the huge window that runs along the entire rear of the restaurant and overlooks the vegas valley . the nice hostess even arranged tables for us so we could sit near the window . everything was great !
1	he absolutely deserves a raise - otherwise i 'll hire him as a salesman for my company ! i ordered the veggie tacos and he volunteered all of the options available to me without me even asking . asked if i 'd like rice , peppers and onions , and lettuce added to my veggie taco . was wonderful and pleasant without seeming desperate for a tip ( which of course i gave him ) . great staffing los tacos ! ! i 'll be back to see him !
1	short rib and mahi tacos were amazing ! the best guacamole ever ! ! salsa was incredibly good ! ! very friendly staff ! ! wonderful in all ways ! !
1	we had several dishes that were great ! highly recommended . prices reasonable
1	everything from the decor , to the music playing , the service and the food was perfect . so many restaurants think they know what puerto rican food is but they always fall short . as a puerto rican far from home and from my mother 's cooking this restaurant was a breath of fresh air and made me feel like i was right back at her dining room table . i would absolutely recommend this to any and everybody . i will definitely be back over and over again ! ! ! !
1	enormous taco salads all around and i just had to grab a carne asada burrito to go , after seeing the neighboring tables ... to die for ! i 'll definitely be coming back alone or with friends and family ! ! the ambiance and layout are perfect for any size party , and the bar is open late ( : ! ! ! hopefully i can get another get together for the live music night . * * * * * 5 stars !
1	my girlfriend and i started off with the chicken flauntas which were really tasty . afterwards she got the vegetable curry bowl which she returned because it was " too spicy . " she said it was really good but she can 't eat spicy foods . the waiter was kind enough to return it and take it off our bill . she then got a caesar salad which she enjoyed . i got the new mexican pork bowl which is served over rice in a red chile sauce . also really good . after a double shot of espresso we left really happy . vidal was an outstanding waiter . very friendly and affable .
1	seriously .... every single thing ! my friends and i waited 2 months for a reservation for 6 . it was worth the wait . we 've already made reservations for next time . we had a lot of the appetizers on the menu . i can say that they were all perfection . the papa bravas were out of this world . i ordered what i thought would be a basic taco " pollo asado " and it was anything but basic . i 've really never had anything better . highly highly highly recommend this place ! we 'll be back asap !
1	the chefs are wonderful and the staff are incredible ! ! best food i 've tasted in years ! ! thank god for hearthstone ! ! it 's my new spot for me and my friends , happy hour is incredible and the servers are so cool !
1	the back beans are good enough to die for .... seriously , they are that good . recommend the emerald chicken or the jerk chicken in a burrito or casa dia . you will not be disappointed !
1	this place is incredible . had attempted to stop in twice before , unfortunately they were closed . the 3rd time was definitely the charm . i had the chicken mole , by which i judge most of my mexican restaurants . it was so flavorful , with a perfect blend of chocolate and cinnamon for the mole . and , the mole is made from scratch , no package mixture used here . my wife had the chicken soup which was incredibly flavorful . the soup was full of chicken and fresh vegetables . everyone was incredibly social and warmly received us . we shall return !
1	the food is out of of this world good , there 's an excellent drink selection , and the staff is very friendly . go on a sunday night , though , it 's way less crowded .
1	the food is great and the family owned friendly atmosphere is really what keeps us coming back . we will keep coming back for years to come . my personal favorite is the red chili burrito enchilada style and my wife always orders the bean burrito enchilada style . you can 't really go wrong with any choice .
1	highly recommend coming here for lunch or dinner . parking can be a pain but it 's worth it .
1	and i mean ever had . this place is absolutely a hidden gem and needs to be explored by all those who pride themselves on knowing good mexican food . the shrimp taco was so delicious and tasty . the blend of flavors was absolutely delightful . the steak mix taco had a great kick of flavors . i appreciated the contrast between the two tacos as a pair .
1	can 't wait to return . the guacamole was fresh and delicious . chips and salsa was out of this world .
1	the a la carte taco selection is superbly gourmet and no selection from it will leave you disappointed . 11 / 10 , would leave my wife to marry tacos & beer if it were a lady .
1	popped in after a haircut in the market , and i couldn 't have been happier . super casual , not a lot of seating , loud and crowded . but the tacos were phenomenal . i opted to try the carnitas , baja fish and octopus . everything was fresh and flavourful , the fish was perfectly crisp , octopus was tender and charred , and the pork was melt in your mouth . double tortillas just because the portions are so hefty , i 'm not sure i could give a stronger yes .
1	this place has a great rating by 1100 + people for a reason . amazing food , warm inviting atmosphere , and top tier service . i went for the 2nd night in a row tonight with a business partner . we 're from texas and we know mexican food and this place is totally legit . paco , the head chef , is an expert in his craft . just about everything is organic and fresh . and the margaritas .... holy crap the margaritas . one more thing . you must ... you must have the flan . do it . you 'll thank me . and i dare you to visit just once . thanks paco !
1	cochinita pibil tacos were amazing . the guacamole was rough chopped but really well balanced amongnst all ingredients . kids were both pleased with their orders as well . cool , small space . i can definitely see how this place could get packed in a hurry . that said , i would wait in line !
1	best service . best food . best quality . clean and cleaner . definitely not what you would expect in a gas station . but you need to try this place . talk with ben . he 's fantastic .
1	far better than their competitors with way more choices and my burritos are always exploding !
1	loved the atmosphere and the service . must visit in phoenix .
1	they 're huge , meat is super tasty and usually cooked perfectly , and the guacamole inside is fabulous . they also have amazing hot sauce , both green and red , but i 'd sample before dumping on your burrito as it can be quite spicy sometimes , and i like it hot !
1	best service , best drinks , best food , best atmosphere , best everything . i 've been here ten times , never had a bad anything .
1	and amazing margaritas ! ! service is always good and this place is family owned ! ! if you have a hankering for authentic mexican food , this is your place ! !
1	being on a low carb diet , it 's hard to find fast food , endless options here ! their salads are also delicious .
1	super clean , friendly staff , and amazing super rolled tacos ! ! !
1	made to order , plus red and green chili sauces are incredible .
1	beats the hell out of macayo 's , garcia 's , serrano 's , carlos or any other of the chain dumps . sometimes you just have to gorge on sloppy , cheesey goodness and this place is the winner hands down .
1	if you like spicy , please get this sauce on anything you order . you will not be disappointed . it 's super spicy and full of flavor . i had a shrimp , green chili burrito with cheese and it was heaven . a great patio area and ladies night on thursdays which gives you happy hour all night ! sorry men ! happy hour is 3 to 6 pm . please come try this place ! full of flavor : - ) angel was the best waitress ever !
1	the pomegranates were a great addition ! my only criticism is there are not enough vegetarian options . in the future , i 'll stick with the guacamole and a side dish since the guacamole is super filling . in fact , its so good i will get an order just for me so that i don 't have to share . the portion sizes of the entrees my husband and i ordered were huge ! we needed to take half of our meals home . a word of caution , the menu is a bit pricey but well worth it . btw - the horchata was terrific , next time i will try the aqua frescas .
1	the table side service where they made it fresh was an unexpected treat and the guacamole itself was bursting with flavor . the atmosphere is casual and comfortable and the service was very friendly . so happy to have found this little gem , i 'm already looking forward to going back !
1	i have been going here for the past twelve years and i would guesstimate that i 've eaten more than 1000 chicken burritos from this place . always clean inside , the food is always fresh . i have know people that have gotten sick ( food poisoning ) from other taco shops like this , but in twelve years i have never heard of anyone getting sick from rolbertos at cave creek & sweetwater .
1	great service and the food was fresh and delicious ! i am from upstate new york and we do not have authentic mexican restaurants , this was such a treat ! ! !
1	amazing service ! the food is authentic mexican , its hot , they personalize any order for picky eaters ( me ) ! they also have a nice little american selection and kids selection to meet everyone 's needs . the staff is amazing so friendly and attentive . i enjoy every time i 'm here. the food is to die for ! melt in your mouth queso dip with chips mmm ! and the chefs special tres taquitos ! and dollar taco night monday and tuesday is great ! i highly recommend i have had only positive experiences with dos coronas ! love ! !
1	the fare was excellent , of course . you can always rely on in n out to deliver their food fresh and hot . what also impresses me are the work crews . no one can be jazzed about working a food gig after midnight , but these employees were serving up the chow w / smiles and a pleasant attitude . i 've always wonder what their employee hiring model is , because in n out crews are always top notch , and i appreciate that . cheers ! rs
1	01 / 2012 moved to sw alma school & warner ( s end of shopping center )
1	$ 0.35 cent wing tuesdays ... good wings and a killer price ... can 't go wrong with that !
1	our party of 6 was seated in 45 mins on a friday night . the host was very helpful . the shrimp was excellent . better than the cajun boiled shrimp i had in new orleans the week prior . we each polished off 1.25 pounds of shrimp with " the whole shebang " seasoning . the wait staff was courteous even though it was busy . this was my 4th visit to this location . will be back again when back in vegas and get the craving for cajun shrimp boil .
1	having never been here before , last night i attended their pig out , a 5-course presentation of food , buffet-style , created by the owner / chef and 3 fellow chefs from the lv area . the food was fantastic , not even factoring in the value the event turned out to be . i must come back just to try more pizza , but they should put that pappardelle and porchetta on the menu !
1	07 / 31 / 15 ; we have eaten at paddington several times , and never been dissatisfied. the service and the food was top notch. i had the eggs benedict firm with smoked salmon which was great. our friend mary had a standard breakfast of bacon , scrambled egg with cheese and home fries. she was thoroughly satisfied with that meal. my sister had the blt with fries one day and then she had a grilled cheese with friesthe other day. we have been satisfied with our meal at paddinton each time we have had a meal there .
1	a quiet little spot hidden away from busy tempe . all freshly made foods . triple berry muffin very good , packed with berries . thick sourdough toast , good quality bacon , and tastey eggs . most definitely returning . fast and kind service .
1	great food and reasonable prices . my only place for breakfast when in las vegas .
1	their brisket , ribs , sausage and jalapeno grits are simply awesome . i like their lean brisket over the fatty brisket & yesterday u can 't go wrong with the jefe sandwich - sausage with brisket or pork is freaking delicious . they have 3 bbq sauces which are crazy with flavor . hands down this is the best beef brisket which i ever had and i really think my move from fl to az is worth because of lmb : ) ) ) . please do try this place this place is beyond delicious and they make the food here with passion and love : ) and be prepared for the wait time because of the huge line but it is totally totally worth it .
1	1000x better than my first time experiencing at nyc beef was seasoned really well and cooked just right concrete was heavenly ( jackpot is aptly named ) overall thoughts whatever they are doing here please keep it up !
1	wonderful food , great service-quick and caring . the bread was delicious , we got calamari , and salad for appetizers . i got the shrimp angel hair , and my boyfriend got the carbonara ( i believe ) the portions are stupendous , & prices were very decent . definitely coming back very soon and recommending to all . thanks !
1	had lunch with my mom , and we were both amazed at the amazingness . i had the lamb burger - which was super tall and contained goat cheese , holy yum , and which almost literally melted my face with joy . mom had the open-faced brisket sandwich and was equally moved , though more maturely so ( slightly ) . we both had a " time to shine " beer , which was magical beyond wizardry . i 'm pretty much reliving this experience right now and it 's still great . go . eat . explode .
1	love love love love this place ! the owner is the nicest dude ever and super acommodating to vegans . every employee is always super nice and great . love this place !
1	the best option for two people or more are the feast platters . i would suggest the collard greens as well .
1	everything they make oozes amazing , homemade , quality goodness . the pancakes are heaven , the hog and chick is fab , and the rosemary breakfast potatoes are perfect . i have been a handful of times , and it 's always worth the wait . note : this place is ridiculously small ( but charming ) , so don 't go with a bunch of friends and expect to sit together ... or be seated anytime soon . carry out is a good option , but only for those who have had the sit in experience first ; )
1	i 'm hooked on their good service , familiar faces , delicious food and the charming , casual , deli-style setting . yum yum .
1	the food is awesome and unique and the lemonade is absolutely incredible . i forget our server 's name , but the tall skinny black guy is one of the best server 's i 've had in vegas .
1	100 % cracker barrel crack addict ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	i bit over price i think. hosted pretty and welcoming , lots of parking clean great atmosphere. will probably come back again. recommended 100 %
1	twisted farm food ? hell yes . very good food , freshly made , amazing presentation , excellent twists on traditional comfort food with portions that could feed two people .
1	the employees were very attentive and nice and the restaurant was very clean . it was our first time and we tried the wraps ( which were huge btw ) - you go anywhere else and you 'll get half the wrap for a larger price . the jalapeño hummus was great ! we also tried the fries which were amazing- idk how they fry them but whatever they use was superb and with the lil added seasoning on top ... whoo ! everything was amazing . i can 't wait to go back to try more items off there huge menu selection . i 'd rate them 10 stars if i could . thank you for a great meal and experience .
1	100 % prettiest , fanciest place i 've ever seen in my life. absolutely breathtaking. from the lobby with rock features and waterfall , to the lit up painted ceiling , to the enormous pools that overlook golf courses and lakes as well as wide 360 views of the surrounding mountains , etc ... just ... wow. even the stairs have little decorations as big as my head. a random pot of flowers sitting in a corner was twice as tall as me. i felt like a little ant .
1	100 % recommended , the music ... the food .. everything ... my favorite restaurant in all arizona , it remind me of my lovely mexico ! !
1	the staff is super friendly , food is ready to eat within minutes of ordering and you can see them make it !
1	been waiting all my life for a grilled cheese bar ! i got the grilled chees that has fried mac n cheese w bacon ! so good
1	a trillion awesome food choices , $ 35 with all you can drink mimosas . service was outstanding . i loved this place , we will return on our next trip .
1	the sizzling chicken plate was moist and juicy . the butter chicken was smooth , flavourful and ... well , buttery . the naan bread , warm and soft with a crispy skin . the rice , fluffy and delicious . in fact the entire mean was delicious ... and the waitress was attentive , pleasant and very helpful . don 't mind the decor with the aging carpet , drop ceiling and homey charm . it 's actually charming in a down to earth and honest kind of way . dump the chain restaurants owned by billionaires , support the local economy and come eat here instead .
1	the food is fresh the wings are crispy and the sauce is amazing . my favorites are the honey mustard and kung pao . the staff is friendly . go support this local business !
1	this restaurant is always my best spot when i travel to arizona . their customer service and food are top notch period . i haven 't found a restaurant that can beat them in these areas . i haven 't tried its bar tho . best dishes : 1st : prime rib ( medium rare ) . 2nd : roti chicken . 3rd : pork ribs .
1	great atmosphere , great service . nick took care of our 20 person group and killed it . custom orders , separate checks , whatever it was he took care of us . guy earned his tip , no doubt about it .
1	cesar took great care of us and the food was perfect . my mother and i never finish our food but tonight we made an exception . flavor town hit us were it counts and we were down for the count .
1	my second time here , just as comforting as i remember my last visit on new years eve . absolutely no complaints on anything , only straight from the heart suggestions : check out their iced teas . so good ! you may even consider ordering the fried chicken . crispy , moist and tender . mashed potatoes are unreal ! ! ! i ordered the broccoli cauliflower and leek casserole , don 't let the name intimidate your taste buds ! a stuffed skillet of hot , thick cream and veggies , ohhhh you won 't regret it ! southern rail has proven to be one of my favorites !
1	awesome bald guy who worked the register offered me a cup of water while waiting and we talked about the olympics for several minutes while i waited for my pizza . pizza itself was delicious - and im from long island / hard to please . was really greasy and that is a drawback for me but a little napkin dabbing did the trick ! wish i could order from them again but they dont deliver to my area !
1	the workers are great , and they never fail to disappoint .
1	i got the medium spice level today and it was awesome ! i got a pound of shrimp and they were pretty big !
1	shout out to adrian for taking care of my family and for making my sister 's birthday super special !
1	he was the best ! it 's been a long time since we have received such genuine sincere top notch service ! the food and atmosphere was very welcoming and relaxing . the music was great . will return and ask for sean ! ! love angry crab
1	kelly-o 's and deluca 's may have been on tv but totins is a true hidden gem . huge portions that are worth every penny . i highly recommend the french toast its life changing . great staff , the owner works in the back and is very personable .
1	in town from texas for a couple of days and was looking for a good veggie spot . wait staff is fast , friendly , and very helpful . sandwiches are pretty large in size and well worth the money . try the dutch-crunch bread !
1	benedict , bloodies and service - wonderful . will be back .
1	all food freshly made there . portions big . atmosphere casual and friendly . best crepes ever .
1	the atmosphere is casual and friendly and the food is outstanding . the crab cakes were better than any i ever had on the maryland coast . i was pleasantly surprised about that . the prime rib was melt in your melt .
1	awesome fish . awesome service . the fish is phenomenal . the batter used really seals the deal . tasty , flaky , and crunchy . the shrimp is huge and is definitely worth trying . give this place a go !
1	poke bowls , cheesesteaks , phat a $ $ burgers , gyros , you 'd be dumb not to go . kool-aid and cream soda as well as the regular drinks . my burger was so big i had to sit for 20 min after cuz i was so full . if you cant decide what to eat or where to go this is the place man . good music and a trendy / relaxing atmosphere . they make you feel like family , any place like that has my vote .
1	the food is great , drinks are great , and the service is even better ! love it !
1	would wife . what is there to say , great cocktails , atmosphere , and food . brunch is wonderful experience every time . one of those places that feels like you are in a bigger city than pittsburgh .
1	last couple times my friend and i have been having brunch . love their ' daisy sunrise-sunset ' drink . for $ 8 , their ' pick three ' breakfast is the best , except that there are so many choices ! morningstar sausage is a nice option , but their oatmeal pancake will fill you up for hours . service was always fabulous and appreciate the advice on limited fruit options . will most certainly be back .
1	nothing but positive things to say about this place . had the most amazing cocktails and bar service while we waited waited to be seated - thank you d ! dinner was was phenomenal ! our server was on point with everything , made our dinner experience 10 times better - thank you adam for making ag 's birthday a special one .
1	the deli side is open ! they have the best sandwiches ! i recommend the ham and cheese on pretzel bread or the turkey and avocado . as soon as you step in eugene makes you feel welcome , is helpful and genuinely glad to serve you !
1	food was great as usual and the service was excellent ! victoria our waitress was great . very nice , fast and professional ! two thumbs up ! ! ribs were excellent ! service was way better . beer selection and full bar . they are hitting their stride ! the mathews resturant is now coming up to the cities resturant . good job ! i highly recommend the pork rind basket as an appetizer ! subsequent visit i lowered their score . service was slow . food still great though !
1	unlimited steak and eggs , chile relleno , omelets , biscuits and gravy , fruit and pastries . all cooked to perfection and very flavorful . i stayed long enough to see what they had for lunch . there was crawfish , seafood paella , rotisserie chicken .... best vegas buffet ever !
1	with a nice sized baked potato and veggies , this was a meal that didn 't leave me hungry . and the prime rib tasted great and was cooked exactly as ordered . waitress was very hospitable .
1	natalie and lauren are fantastic ! ! you should come here .
1	all u can eat for $ 12.99 every sunday ... they also give away authentic nfl jerseys for monday night football . the patio is a breath of fresh air in a town where most bars are dark and dreary . what a fun place with great fun people to hang out with !
1	you won 't find a better deal or a more fun atmosphere . we has the best server named jessica--she was very professional , fun and attentitve even though she had a few other big tables . they were great about keeping our champage glasses full . this is now one of our " must hit " places on the strip--we have been a couple times before and each time had a great experience . the food was great , too--the portions are way too big !
1	it was a pretty decent buffet and the food tasted really great . there wasn 't anything that i didn 't like and a few dishes that were binge eating worthy . i like the tandoori and the chicken curry . the staff was friendly too and very attentive . never an empty glass of water and every few minutes , someone walks around offering more and more naan !
1	10 dollars and some change for a po boy drink and fries is a really great deal and this is also really great food. i got a catfish po boy and the catfish was crispy and moist. im a huge fan of cajun / louisiana food so its always cool when new restaurants open up. give this one a try and support local businesses
1	i didn 't have the food here , cuz i was only interested in the cheap ( relatively cheap ) drinks here . when other places in vegas are charging 14 dollars , it 's no wonder we came here 2 nights in a row !
1	chicken dinner is also really nice . the restaurant is clean . the owner is friendly and nice .
1	quick . fast . somewhat healthy ... but oh sssooo good ! open super late on those drunken nights and is always ready to eat . i go here at least once a week and i am addicted to this stuff . you will not be disappointed .
1	breakfast sandwich : bacon cooked perfectly crispy , the blend of guacamole and applewood smoked bacon is a true pleasure . the perfect breakfast treat ! the steak and eggs was a larger portion than expected and the chimichurri sauce was the perfect accompaniment . i 'm surprised it was not more busy ! they have a dog friendly back patio . honestly , how amazing is that ? the service was attentive and the options of beers is impressive . you must try as many as you can before you commit to one . it 's a must try . if i lived in town if be here every sunday .
1	) . this is perfectly hot , flavourful , with a flakey crust . there is science and love in these pies that is not replicable for $ 10 in your own kitchen , let 's face it ! we ate the butter chicken , and a prime rib ones . it was like a warm hug on a cold day . except it was summer , and we were just starving .
1	excellent . only complaint is they kept the restaurant a little on the warm side .
1	about 10 pounds of crab legs and prime rib later , i was finally full .
1	say what you will about vegetarian / vegan fare , i 'm pretty sure the most carnivorous of carnivores would leave zeniths sunday brunch satisfied . yep , 10 bucks will get you 1 entree ( you pick from 5 or 6 choices ) that comes with 2 sides . next choose your drink- coffee or tea ( hot or iced ) then get your ass up to the buffet table where cakes , breads , fresh fruit and salads a plenty await you . arrive early to get a table or put your name in and browse around the antique shop until a table opens up .
1	i have eaten at manhattan 's twice before and will definitely be going back again soon ! ! ! fresh , made to order , and delicious ! ! !
1	great drinks , great food , and excellent service . highly recommended .
1	marianne and stephen treated us to a feast . this is my third time there . no hesitation recommending .
1	did i mention that the food basically forced me to change my pants immediately afterward ? and i mean that in a positive way , not in a rushing to the bathroom way . i 've still never been for breakfast but i did order a couple breakfast dishes for dinner and was not disappointed . the crispy salmon dish is not only delicious it 's also healthy which i 'm not sure you can say for the rest of the menu . i did feel a bit like half the menu might kill me with how much food and richness they provide but what the fuck do i care . eat up and worry about your health later .
1	hands down best burgers ever ! i came here two nights in a row because the food was so good . rising sun and long horn are best ! great flavor ! it would be an insult to put ketchup or mustard on this burger . good food , good service , awesome place ! ! ! ! ! ! come down immediately ! ! ! ! ! !
1	vacation and when i 'm back on vegas i 'll be back here for sure
1	10 stars service , good food and very clean place : ) i love this place , clam chowder must try
1	the size , the flavors , the food , the fooood ! i can 't express my love for this restaurant in words . you must go here . please ! ! best chicken and waffles ever . i don 't know what they do to their fried chicken but it must have been rolled in gold dust and liquid amazing . my mouth is watering just thinking about this place . ok i can 't say anymore or i 'm going to have to drive here now !
1	vegas ' best kept off strip secret ! wow ! you know those places where every dish you taste , as son as you taste it , you go ... oh wow ... yeah , this is one of those . the prices are way reasonable for such an experience . just go . just order . you will be glad you did .
1	brunch was wonderful - chicken and waffles are must and bottomless mimosas - yes please . jp was our server and he was awesome ! he was upbeat and kept up with our table of 4 even though it was busy . our food was wonderful and jp kept our glasses full at all times . i would suggest checking this place out for brunch or any time of the day . thank you again and i will be back next time i 'm in vegas !
1	always remember the " wiz " ! ! ! makes a great start to the weekend .
1	the staff were very pleasant and tended well to our needs . there were 4 of us and we each had half of the turkey sandwich on a flat bread . we all agreed that it was very flavorful and fresh . delicious ! ! i especially liked that they used boston lettuce and the cherry tomatoes tasted like a tomato and not flavorless like so many . they must have a good produce purveyor . i will go back for sure . cudo 's to the staff and chef ! ! ! highly recommend the green house
1	they loved it ! gary was our awesome server , funny engaging , & one of the reasons we come here ( not to take away from the best pancake ever & the coffee is perfect heaven in my mouth ) . you do yourself a disservice if you don 't make this a regular part of your vegas visits ! !
1	always heard good comments about the food ... i have to say the food was incredible ! the service amazing ! the atmosphere soooo comfortable . had this to eat : the morehouse - chorizo patty + potato hash + poblano queso + sunnyside egg + green tomato + bacon aioli . paradise on a plate . side of smoked mac n cheese ( best mac i ever had ) 5 star recommendation
1	they were getting ready to close & he stayed open for me and let me order with a smile . get that guy a raise . as a business owner myself i 'd be happy to have him running my team . thanks edward , sincerely scott
1	ordered the endibias con queso de cabra again but the garlic sauce came out overpowering and salty . i was happy to see kevin and after having him make it again , it came out great like the first time at lunch . mary our server was sweet and attentive ! 3 : 00pm gary was our server for the day and he was informative about the each tapas and desserts . everything came out flavorful and fresh . to top it off , the last two desserts were amazing !
1	the bison , salmon , chicken and turkey all have received favorable feedback and i tried breakfast today .... very satisfied
1	1130 has everything to offer. i have worked at many steak houses ever since i was eligible to work , and find that the steak at 1130 is the best i have ever had. the prices are not as cheap as a steak at your local texas roadhouse , but it is so worth paying the extra money. service is amazing. always friendly faces and the servers are willing to do whatever it takes to please the customer. if mistakes are made , the managers are more than willing to do whatever it takes as well to make the customer happy and come back as well. definitely downtown 's best kept secret !
1	greeted at the door as soon as i walked in , sat , and given menu , all in under a minute . michelle was an excellent waitress , attentive and polite . she moved with a purpose , and it showed . food came out quickly , a sandwich and fries w pop / coffee . she checked on me several times , and was really sweet . got a nice hot coffee to top off the meal . standard denny 's quality chow , but service makes the difference .
1	11 / 4 / 17 had dinner here tonight every thing was great leonardo b our waiter was outstanding great suggestion on wine that was terrific and very good suggestion on our entrées and appetizers place was packed very good sign on a saturday night will go back as often as possible highly recommend this to everyone price is excellent for the value in service that you get dinner here tonight with friends drinks apps and entree and deserts very good service was excellent owner came over to see how things were will go back prices very good value
1	even had breakfast there once . the food is always exceptional and the service is great . food always comes out promptly . i seem to always end up with the almond crusted pork , asparagus , and white cheddar mashed potatoes . don 't even get my started on the rolls . yum ! ! ! ! slightly pricey . great location . always clean . they do take reservations or walk-ins . happy hour has great prices and great selection of appetizers and drinks . definitely recommend and will be back . try the margaritas !
1	food is always great , staff is friendly always ! my dad still talks about how kind the manager was ( a year later ) when he visits my house . i think some people just have to write something negative about everything . but from personal experience this is the place to go . they always make my day great ! keep up the good work !
1	? ! i got the zucc it bowl . it tasted amazing and seriously it was only 115 calories ? i don 't believe it for how much food it was . it had a spice to it that was just right . i also got a side of truffle fries . it was actually a lot more than i expected . first time here definitely impressed me . will definitely go back to try other things on the skinny menu .
1	we arrived with a lady in the parking lot trying to sell me and my friend jewelry to buy laundry softener , super random and declined politely . wait time was less than 15 minutes , getting our drink order was also quick and ordering just went smoothly . i admired the three plate specials displayed by the front along with the rotation cake fridge . i ordered a chilequile which meant i cleared my plate . my group cleared their plates as well and didnt forget to tip our server . while we were heading to pay our tab the wait line was pretty long but i was digging this old lady 's style with wearing two eye glasses trying to keep the queue down .
1	$ 11 for a drink , chips and tuna melt with banana peppers .. the best $ 11 i 've ever spent in my life .
1	what can you say . $ 9.99 for steak and eggs . $ 4.99 for 3 eggs , bacon or sausage , hash-brown potatoes and toast . i sprang for a $ 5 bowel of sliced strawberries ( so good and good for you too , don 't forget your fruit and vegetables ! ) great late night food with a friend .
1	my absolute favorite sandwich shop to ever exist . i went everyday once for 3 weeks . not only is their food delicious but the employees couldn 't be more attentive and kind . this place really values their customers satisfaction to the full extent . greatest customer service i 've ever received . i hope to see this company grow in years to come ! !
1	service is amazing ( if you 're lucky you 'll get ryan ! ) , food was delicious , and drinks were great . you get a ton of food for your money and it 's quick . great environment with a few tvs to watch some games on . would absolutely recommend !
1	this capriotti 's is located on charleston blvd next to the walmart neighborhood market . the moment we walked in we were greeted by a friendly employee behind the counter , who had a hilarious sense of humor . i ordered my sub that was a medium philly cheese steak ! great sub , it wasn 't super greasy , and the best part was that it 's a really flavorful sandwich . now i wasn 't thinking when i ordered the medium , it was too big , but oh well- i ended up bringing the other half home .
1	the food was fantastic including the lollipop lamb and yummy shrimp and duck fat fries ! ! we love this place . the food and drinks and the staff are all excellent .
1	ordered a steak bomb , clam chowder , and a junior roast beef sandwich , three-way ( mayo , cheese & bbq sauce ) to-go . everything was amazing ! simple but quality is there . portions are pretty big for a decent price ! definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu ! : )
1	licked the plate after the last slice . a little pricey for a large ( $ 30 ) , but definitely worth it .
1	excellent service , used plate gone before back to table . drinks refilled before half empty . food delicious , japanese food tastes just like moms ! only downer no crab at lunch . teriyaki flank steak , sliders , even thai salad was good ! desserts were mmm mmm good !
1	rack of lamb , all seafood , fresh sushi , truffle fries , prime rib , etc . great food !
1	this place is set up beautifully ; and it has a microbrewery inside of it so there are plenty of beer options available . we were seated , and got a friendly attentive server- you can 't beat that . i ordered the porchini halibut with bok choy , asparagus , and mashed potatoes . this was ridiculously delicious , everything was flavorful and cooked perfectly . i also go a moscow mule , and it was nice and strong . i will definitely come back to try more of their dishes .
1	especially with the salad / potatoe of choice . occasionally you 'll get a good waitress who will gladly change the side salad to caesar salad . those waitresses deserve an extra tip . graveyard specials ? learn to love them ! this place is the perfect example of south point being a great value . $ 3.95 for a ny steak with eggs / toast / hash browns after midnight 7 days a week . all the servers here are good , the food is excellent and the bar area is perfect for people like myself , who dislike waiting in line and skip right through ...... to eat and then run back to the poker room .
1	i had the chicken fried steak for 4.99 ! ! huge freakin serving and the waitress was super funny .
1	totally worth the price - especially if you love mussels , oysters , and shrimp . everything is in abundance and fresh ! the buffet options are plentiful and have your breakfast staples . some things are also made to order . can 't go wrong with brunch here , just make sure you place a reservation or arrive earlier than the actual time you want to eat . sunday funday - no doubt !
1	an experience of a lifetime . every single dish was well cooked and imaginatively served .
1	be warned the wine bottles are $ 40-44 . amazing fries ! ! !
1	the server was great to serve us . the food was absolutely amazing . all 12 of us ate every bite and the chef even comes to your table to check on how your service was . highly recommended . stellar service .
1	now i just need to learn how to properly prepare it and this is going to be a go-to stop after visiting vegas . they recently moved to a new and bigger store and have a small pop-up restaurant inside that serves a few pretty unique dishes . looks like the menu is always changing so hopefully they 'll have the foie gras pancakes still . looking forward to the dishes they have to offer me when i make my next visit !
1	our food came out fast ( in a packed house on saturday night ) , was delicious , and the portion was so big that i ( a 20 year old college athlete ) could not even finish . the waitress was great and very attentive . i 'll definitely be back soon .
1	life is good ! food here is amazing ! by far best pizza in town !
1	going to eat there again today . the pork loaded french fries are great . i also tried a special fish taco dish that was really good as well . it 's not that crowded on saturdays when we have gone for lunch and the staff is very friendly .
1	this place was the first eatery i saw when getting into mgm from their self parking lot . there wasn 't that many people when i got there around 1pm on a sunday . the employees here were pretty friendly especially the cashier . the ingredients looked fresh , woot ! the eating area was kept very clean , there was always someone cleaning up ! it takes about 8 minutes to bake in the oven . when it came out , it smelled , looked , and tasted delicious .. maybe cause i was super hungry ... the crust was super thin , just the way i like it . will be back again .. !
1	please ike my review after this sandwich changes your life .
1	now we bring new friends here too . it 's changed over the years , adding a bar , with lots of local beers on tap . just a matter of changing with the customer needs . food stays great though and the hot sauces are my husbands favorite ( aside from the nuclear wings ) nothing is too hot for him . my daughter and i love the chicken and black bean combo con queso ! the garlicky new potatoes and stir fry are our sides of choice but they have a pretty assortment to choose from .
1	i have consistently had great food & top notch service . if you sit at the bar , the bartenders are well educated and make you feel at home . tuesdays is half price bottles of wine all day , and half price starters til 7pm . of course , it gets crowded so get there early to get a spot at the bar , or make reservations for the dining room .
1	the menu offers a variety of dishes without being overwhelming . their awesome roast beef sandwich is , well , awesome , and their salads are always great . i love their panfried flounder , pork chops and prime rib too . i 've had their dessert only one time - the banana cream pie - and it was delicious ! 131 main is a great place to eat in the charlotte area - consistenly good food , attentive servers and a low-key environment .
1	we ordered the ribs and crab cakes for our entrees . the ribs was perfect and the crab cakes was great as well the string beans were seasoned just right as well as the asparagus . the service was excellent and the wait staff was very attentive . can 't ask for much more .
1	it never disappoints . the menu is great and the food is always fresh and delicious . the ambience is very romantic and my husband and i will keep this as one of go-to place for date night
1	the service and food are impeccable . i have never had a bad experience at the restaurant and feel like the staff truly make the evening enjoyable .
1	excellent service , and every meal was delicious . this is even more impressive since it was during queen 's feast . let 's face it , the chaos of queen 's feast usually results in poorer service and rushed meal prep . if the experience is good during this week , then normal weeks will be phenomenal . cedar plank salmon was some of the best i 've had anywhere . crab cake salad was awesome as well . qf selection desserts were excellent - and ginormous ! overall great dinner at a great value .
1	that 's a pretty good deal , and you can bring your own cooler filled with booze ! i never liked golfing , but i took on this course with two girlfriends . we aren 't great golfers , but this course is fun to play on and not intimidating at all . the course is quite pretty too , set against the backdrop of the papago mountains . i thoroughly enjoyed attempting to golf while getting drunk . next time i 'm bringing cigars , then i 'll feel like a true golfer .
1	need i say anything else ? ok , here 's the catch . when you walk in you will feel like you have found the walmart of all casinos . people are dressed in pj bottoms , slippers , sloppy t-shirts and have cigs hanging between their yellow teeth . i 'm past all of that . hang a left pull up a chair and have a delicious inexpensive meal with the locals .
1	you wish more places and owner / operators existed like this .
1	manage your expectations cause at that price there are no frills . also , it 's a throwback 1970 's style steakhouse , not a hipster enclave . however the portions are good and the food is solid .
1	this place somewhere where everyone can feel like they can " duck out " of their busy day and truly .... relax . they have a small outdoor patio with palm trees lit at night where again ; allows customers even options for something hot or cold to drink ... and continue to enjoy the dining experience . i love their $ 6 sunday burger platter which is ... huge . the staff is always attentive , and sitting at the bar is always a pleasure . wonderful place and one of my favorites in this area .
1	this chain beats subway , togo 's & quizno sub hands down ! we were shopping at the outlet but decided not to eat in their food court because the choices were truly horrid . i am glad we came here because the ladies that were on shift were very friendly & greeted us well . the place was clean , customer service was excellent & , of course , the food is always delicious . i just love jersey mike 's .
1	my favorite part about my college experience was union grill , without question . i remember the barrels soda cups ( which is great because i drink gallons of diet coke ) , and the enormous portions of delicious food , and they always had an appealing , legit vegetarian option . i remember my favorite items included pirogis with the slowly sauteed caramelized , savory onions on top . slap yo ' momma good ! so after 4 years in pittsburgh , the conclusion : college : sucked union grill : my reason for living
1	i ordered the bacon jalapeño cheeseburger and i 've had it several times before at other locations but none like this ! the burger was cooked to perfection , they didn 't skimp on the fries , and oh did i say the burger was cooked perfectly ? glad i work nearby because i 'll be stopping in a lot more often .
1	, love yes love the capistrami it is a pistrami with coleslaw 20 inches huge feeds three no problem , or 2 or one big huge eater ! its really good and for the price pistrami , fantastic bread , colesaw , dressing salt and pepper , the perfect pairing of each . if you go to one place for lunch dinner call it in and they will have it read ! really a pleasure to write this review . absolutely the best ! ! !
1	the service is great , the food is tasty . though if you order a schnitzel , please specify that you want it pan seared in butter ( they 'll gladly do so ) . if you don 't you 'll get a dry deep-fried schnitzel ... and believe me you do not want that . the way it 's prepared makes all the difference . this is not the fault of the kitchen , it 's just what they 're told to do , so it in no way reflects badly on them . oh and get some pretzels , they 're good stuff .
1	set menu 15-20 courses . i loved the ash crackers . the menu was innovative , every dish had a unique twist . decor was very restoration hardware like most trendy restos to . i definitely enjoyed my meal . : )
1	they were perfect . i have dreams about those pancakes .
1	full , local and organic menu- the fish tacos were spicy and delicious . our waiter was awesome , friendly and had great recommendations . a little more expensive than the surrounding spots but totally worth the extra buck ! !
1	went there with husband on friday night . sandwich really good ! ruben , cuban , crispy chicken . all very good !
1	.awesome cheap prices for the amount of food that is served . i chose the denver omelette with a side of fruit and wheat toast . mmmmmmmm .. perfect mix of onions.bell peppers . and cheese . .delicious. you gotta come try it . .it looks a lil wierd outside but oh well . the food is goood ! !
1	busy and noisy but clean . very friendly and attentive staff . brenda waited on us and was sweet and made sure to take care of us . manager walking around greeting people . will be back : )
1	nice , thick , and juicy ! i always come back and bring new people here and they all enjoy it
1	we got cheese only and it 's the best pizza i 've had in las vegas so far . i think i may stop looking . it will be tough to top it . so gooood ! perfectly greasy and chewy ! i can 't wait to puck up another one . the homemade lemonade ain 't bad either .
1	happy , upbeat , wonderful ! i will be coming back just for her service ! thank you mandy ! ! !
1	thats a good ass deal . great place for brunch . i always heard this place was expensive but i thought the prices were actually reasonable ! the drunken goat sandwich was gooood !
1	heavenly food and the most impeccable , ceremonious and customer oriented service . food heaven . close to perfection !
1	prime cut rib eye was the best steak i have ever eaten in my entire life ! ! ! i was literally in heaven while devouring this precious piece of meat ! i couldn 't even open my eyes while i was chewing bc it was so mf ono just melting away in my mouth ! thank you baby jesus to the steakhouse who closed at 930 who reccommended me to come here ! ! ! ! ! best steak ever ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i am definitely going back on my next visit to vegas !
1	birthday celebration . no reservation . the staff at cbcb made it work , in very little time , and with a smile . it was trivia night , to boot ! i love this place ; customer service counts in the service industry , and the team working here know it , and it shows . and , they have my favorite beer , college street 's big blue van !
1	monday 's = $ 5 burgers tuesday = 40cent wings wednesday = tacos & quesadillas thursday = 35cent mussels friday = buyonegetone appetizers
1	if you 're not a fan of omelets or scrambled eggs , they have an extensive breakfast menu as well . still have yet to try their lunch and dinner menu , tho .
1	wow ! ! ! now that is ' crazy fast delivery ' . our sandwich was so tasty . i 'm impressed , and cannot wait to order again . the bread was so flavorful , as was the meat and veggies . they did not even charge a delivery fee . choose your sandwich , add your tip ... and have a nice day ! boo ya .
1	i randomly went there the first day of my vegas trip for lunch because we were staying at the wynn across the street and couldnt wait to go back the next day . simple sandwich with a lot of lobster meat . yeah , only a few tables outside in the heat but that didnt bother me all that much . i wonder if they would deliver to texas . : )
1	you would probably walk by this spot 100 times and never walk in . do yourself a favour and order # 18 on the menu . flatbread style mixed ingredients pizza . awesome .
1	the butter cake for dessert is amazing . best service in town !
1	lobster mashed potatoes were good . the portion was huge . it can probably feed 3 to 4 people .
1	but i 'm going to . if you work in this area and you want a wonderful salad i highly recommend coming to taylor 's cafe . i have met a couple of my work friends here on different lunch outings and i am never disappointed by the salad selection . they ordered the greek salad and it looked amazing-- they confirmed that it tasted just as good as it looked . i have ordered multiple items and have always enjoyed them ! so glad i found this little gem !
1	postponed raidtion surgery just to go to the cne. it 's always a family treat walking around taking in the smell of all the foods and sounds of the rides games and the jets flying over head . see all the smiles from people that win prizes . the food is great from corn dogs to ribs and chicken wings there 's something for everyone . .99 cent pasta is always a treat and let 's not forget the waffle ice cream . a big family favorite . the only bad thing it marks the end of summer .
1	$ 19.95 pitcher and smoked meat poutine was a total win. service was quick , but not too terribly attentive. the patio was small and busy , but there was no wait to sit down .
1	the cafe has a special for $ 1.99 breakfasts for late nighters ... meaning right after you just danced your butt off .... get in a cab and come down here for some yummy grub . the food is pretty good , normal breakfast regulars , eggs , potatoes , pancakes .. nothing crazy special ... other than the price . just what you need after you paid for bottle service ... something cheap !
1	that really covers it ! i 've been going here since i was a youngin ' and couldn 't enjoy vegas beyond the sights and the food my parents took me to . this being one of them ! cant go wrong with the cheap shrimp cocktail here , served up in an old soda fountain sundae glass ; jam packed with shrimp smothered in cocktail sauce . its a shrimp sundae of goodness !
1	a free airport shuttle ( i 've hopped it while staying at another hotel ! ) cheap buffet that 's reminiscent of college dorm cafeteria food . terrible 's rocks .
1	ac is nice and strong in the morning 2 . the service was super attentive and fast 3 . the vibe here is super cool must come when in vegas 4 . the food is large portions 5 . more expensive than other diners but well worth 6 . will come again when in vegas
1	we went and ordered 2 3 meat combos with pulled pork , tri tip , ribs , sausage and chicken breast . the sides collared greens , pork-n-beans , potato salad and cole slaw . the food is excellent . i will be back . # 1 bbq in town
1	best 3 am diner ... ever . 2 . milkshakes = incredible . 3 . always an eclectic and eccentric crowd . especially if i 'm there . 4 . mac and cheese sucks . except after about 6-8 drinks . then delicious . 5 . burgers are awesome . 6 . prices are just right . 7 . awesome shirts . 8 . right near some of my favorite bars . what 's not to love ?
1	2 ) best manhattan i 've ever had ! the staff is very friendly and the environment is very cool ... i also like the unique foods on their menu . if you have not been there before , then you have to try the chopped salad .
1	best . best . 2 ) fantastic service . 3 ) by la standards , super cheap .
1	best latté i 've had in over a decade . 2 . cappuccino was amazing , just not my thing . but very yummy and well-prepared . 3 . the price was very reasonable . 4 . the owner is quite a character who will make and serve your order quickly if that 's what you need . on the other hand , if you feel like staying and chatting , you will not be disappointed . you just don 't get that kind of personality anymore . 5 . a family-owned business that 's been open for fifty-one years . awesome .
1	although the decor could be updated , their food is great . my favorite is their fried zucchini . it 's amazing ! ! ! it didn 't take long at all for us to receive our food and they were very courteous . i will definitely go again .
1	lots of selection unlike the other buffets around the strip . great price for great food : ) best value ! loved the steak , seafood & desserts ! will def come back when in vegas .
1	normally you could not pay me to eat at a restaurant in a strip mall , but this place is worth driving for . the strip mall almost is needed though because the wait to get a table is almost always 30 minutes plus ( i have experienced 60 + ) . i wish i had two stomachs so i could actually finish a burger in a shake . always a long wait , always loud , and always awesome !
1	1 ) chicken for 2 more like chicken for 4 2 ) food is great , chicken delicious , flavours work well , not over spiced , not heavy handed with the sauce , sweet buns are boss , pickled onion is pickled right and saw a waitress walking over a sick looking burger with a beautiful runny fried egg on it 3 ) they make good drinks , like really good drinks
1	4 ) fresh sushi 5 ) cocaine 6 ) awesome breakfast items 7 ) delicious pasta. come here for lunch , stay for dinner. trust. it 'll be worth your time. the line can get long , but come on ... they serve # 5 here. you just gotta ask for it. no lie ! you can believe me . ^ _ ^
1	close to my house . 2 . good pizza . 3 . really good cheesesteaks . best in town ? maybe . best in se vegas ? yes . 4 . amazing prices . got the weekend special - $ 3.99 large cheese pizza . $ 7.99 cheesesteak with drink . 5 . friendly service . if they had a couple tvs up for watching games , and offered a few craft beers , it would be amazing .
1	cornbread ! 2 . amazing southern food , everything was equally delicious . great place to feel at home and fix your craving for fried chicken and all things southern . their cakes look incredible too . try and save room , i wasn 't able to and regret not taking a piece to-go .
1	dennis , waitperson , is awesome , great product knowledge and service delivery ; 2 . the food is good . fresh and tasty , with interesting spice palets ( afghan , indian and mediterranean ) . standouts : chicken samosas , afghan " pico , " the various naan breads , the white dipping sauce . special mention : the habanero and the jalapeno chutneys . would i eat there again ? yes .
1	double barrel buger cooked perfectly . 2 . fries , perfectly cooked with great seasoning 3 . loaded nachos with beef brisket and pulled pork , outstanding ! 4 . dogfish 90 , perfect . 5 . staff : well staffed , friendly and good . this place could just coast based on its location on the strip , but the place is excellent !
1	the burger is great , and the cheese curds are beyond phenomenal . very fresh . the atmosphere is wonderful as well- with the all glass windows overlooking the capitol .
1	however , that doesn 't change the fact that they have some pretty darn good pies ! plus they come in the cutest and convenient take out boxes ever . i 've tried both the braised beef and the pulled pork , but pulled pork is my favourite ( for now ... ) .
1	not only the value , but the food itself tastes great . the only place i really think about when people ask me what we should eat while out in vegas . the only thing i really don 't like is the small dining area which causes a long waiting time to be seated . this is one of those few places i would gladly wait for however . the casino itself is pretty drab and doesn 't compare at all to anything on the strip , but that 's not why i go there .
1	gordon ramsay is my favorite celebrity chef . 2 . eat with confidence that the kitchen is spotless . 3 . the shakes are absolutely delicious . 4 . the burgers are cooked perfectly 5 . expect me to eat there again .
1	great location 2 . did a kinda sorta blind date ( enriched experience , new place and new person .... interesting ) well in short , i really like citizen public house and the menu rocks and the staff makes killer suggestions . now on the other hand , nothing to do with the restaurant , but no more meeting anyone from tinder . that would of been the only part of this meal that was not so appetizing . but as a good sport , went with the flow and enjoyed myself and let the food , ambiance and alcohol do the trick . i just wish the reviews on tinder were as accurate as yelp. lol ... strongly recommend and will be back ... sooooon .
1	+ 1 waiter was attentive- filling water , asking how the meal was , etc
1	my tip is to try the cucumber salad instead of fries ! ! ! ! ! you won 't be disappointed . side salad is phenomenal also , all fresh ingredients ! ! ! ! ! ! support local ! ! ! ! ! best sauce i 've ever tried ! !
1	here is a link to my ( and a friend 's ) food vlog ( youtube video ) about tbbqj : https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = kjymvaay0gw 2 . they have moved , and have added new additions to the menu . try the smoked corned beef reuben and the honey chili glazed wings . omg omg omg omg .
1	we waited about 20 mins and someone finally came over . it 's the holidays so we get it . the food was amazing as always !
1	3 ) pancake flights ? genius ! ! really good quality and interesting smart unique options atmosphere is loud but really energetic with a live dj . leaving full n happy
1	anytime i want to go out for a special occasion , no question where we are going . classy atmosphere , good service and the food is off the charts . bone-in filet & lobster mash are divine . definitely my favorite of the mastro 's line . this place is a keeper .
1	everyone has their favs .... the capistrami , the cheeseteak with mush ... mine is definitely the bobby . in case you haven 't viewed their menu yet , the bobby is thanksgiving leftovers in a huge sandwich ... yeah , exactly .
1	i was greeted right away . 2 . cashier was very kind and funny . 3 . got a little burger ( that is not really little at all ) with fresh jalapeño peppers with cajun fries . burger was awesome . fresh ingredients . fries were a little too spicy for me but good . 4 . i come here once a quarter for my " indulge ... eat whatever i want " day . service is always awesome . not to mention the food . fresh and delicious . i wish i could give this guys 10 stars . great work ! ! ! ! i shall return soon .... more like within the next 90 days . oh yes .
1	this place is way too fun and everyone seems to be so friendly . plus they have their beers for 2.50 ( it 's also a brewery and they are delicious ) this place will deff be my go to anytime i go out to vegas
1	its my new place to hit up for a fast and great bite . i give them 5 stars ( :
1	great job , dakota and crew . oh and a tenaya creek beer .
1	the food is amazing , the place is great and the service was excellent . i will definitely go back .
1	the burgers were very flavorable and juicy . i need to do some research and see if they have other locations . we got seated right away , the wait time was not to long and our waiter was awesome . answered our questions about the burgers and didn 't seem to mind when we kept changing our mind on the drink orders .
1	my family of 4 has now gone to this restaurant 3 times . it 's been consistent in service and quality of food . i highly recommend the steak salad and the rueben sandwich . my toddlers love the alfredo pasta with broccoli on the adult menu . every time we go in it 's busy with regulars and new customers yes service is always quick . prices are also really reasonable , overall great place !
1	their biscuits are so delicious and warm . portions are so huge that you 'll most likely have leftovers for tomorrow . service is great and everyone that works there is friendly and always checking up on you . pricey .... but worth every penny
1	best thing about it is the atmosphere , its warm and fun and feels like a big family get together with out all the horrors of actually being with your own family . only thing to note is that becasue he is just one man the food can take a long time . soonly go if you are prepared to stay a while ( which you should ) , don 't go if you have an hour to eat before catching a film .
1	i told him the sweet tea i purchased wasn 't great , he compensated me & had excellent customer service . polite and sincere , even dealing with a customer bragging about some stupid french fries not being fresh . he was amazing . dont forget to mention the military discount ; )
1	2 ) the menu is amazing and i love how they list how many calories is in each meal for those who are watching their calorie intake . 3 ) chilean sea bass is out of this world ! ( gotta order it , melts in your mouth ) 4 ) scallops are as equally awesome as the chilean sea bass . you can 't go wrong here , it 's a beautiful venue with an equally beautiful menu .
1	this place is great ! we have had just about every thing on the menu and it 's all fantastic ! the service is always great !
1	$ 1 oysters during happy hour. and that 's all you need to know .
1	they were fresh and delicious . worth every penny ! !
1	perfect bread 2 . great unique menu 3 . super fast service with quality food . 4 . great filling my favorite subs are the beach club and club lulu ! try this place you won 't regret it .
1	my fave is the super six ( well done ) . just wish they were open later .
1	i mean obama chose these pancakes once which is good enough for me . i remember when after living in pittsburgh for six months an employee of mine looked at me like i didn 't speak english cause i had never been here . now that i have been here like 25 times i wonder how i haven 't reviewed this place before . i have to be honest everything is average except for the pancakes which are are like 27 stars !
1	be patient because it does take a while to get food and beverages . they could also improve on the biscuits , i 'm from the south so i have high expectations when it come to biscuits .
1	loco moco with garlic rice is delicious and the red velvet pancakes as the upgraded side is the perfect amount . pass on the mac salad . nice spot to check out away from the strip for a bomb meal at a much nicer price .
1	if you like hot sandwiches , very affordable and filling , the bread its toasted lightly , and just crunchy enough on the outside & soft on the inside . they have a set menu for the different ingredients in your sandwich , & i would recommend the full montagu , comes with roast beef , turkey & vegetables in a nice cream mustard sauce ! ! oh & if you happen to be here around thanksgiving & xmas , get the holiday sandwich , its like having turkey left overs with all the goodness inside !
1	he was exemplary . a good server makes the meal great , and he was great . 2 ) . we had the burger which was amazing . and the fries were some of the best i 've ever had . had the corned beef hash special which was very good . the poached egg on the hash however was fantastic . 3 ) draft beer was cold and crisp , nice clean beer lines . overall , everything was perfect . prices were high but reasonable . highest recommendation .
1	just not much to choose from in desert ridge . still i thought the food was good , and will go back there .
1	1 star for attentive service 3 stars for the amazing foie gras brulee ! ! ! definitly unique. sweet and salty and perfect . i had the restaruant week menu with corn chowder , halibut , and chocolate smores dessert . food was excellent . my husband ordered the foie gras brulee appetizer and the kobe steak . i stole the appetizer . it was so yummy .
1	1 star for having a huge menu and good portions . 1 star for not kicking us out when my friend fell asleep at the table . 1 star for allowing us to throw french fries at her and make a mess . 1 star for making it ok to do this all post-club at 4 : 30am , barefoot . thanks for being there during my birthday trip to vegas . i 'm not ashamed to say i visited you , at times , more than twice in a span of 24 hours . i can only hope i 'm lucky enough to visit you soon .
1	my cousin had her wedding here and it was truly fabulous fancy experience ! you know the food is unique , when the table was mesmerized by the salad . wellington beef was delish . try their trademark pink lychee drink ( u can ask them to spike it for u ! ) which all the relatives ( even the aunties ) loved . may have been all the romance in the air , the breathtaking view ... spending 7 hours up in canoe , the world looked so much more beautiful than when we had to finally come down to earth ( sappy , i know ! ) .
1	in-n-out is a socal institution , still family-owned by the snyder family for their entire history .. every location is company-owned , there are no franchises and no " big corporation " behind the brand . simply put , this is the best fast-food burger in the land , bar none , imho and of many , many others . they use nothing but fresh ingredients - nothing is ever frozen - and their employees are the best in the industry , no doubt the fact that they 're the best-paid in the industry has something to do with that . if you 've never had one - drop by for a double-double and experience true burger bliss .
1	there is a atm onsite if you need to get cash . this location is always busy ! drive thru or walk up . the fish and chips is delicious . i love the pete 's sauce . you can even buy it by the gallon . if you do not like fish they offer chicken strips , burgers and onion rings . except they do not serve chicken on fridays . seating is only outside but they have misters if it is hot outside . but the weather does not prevent people from coming ! ! ! not open on sunday 's .
1	everything was fresh and delicious ! our service was quick and friendly .
1	1st good food , really good 2nd great service 3rd fair prices 4th dogs outside ok ( truly pet friendly ) what more do want ?
1	the server was very friendly and very helpful . was even able to make the pizza the way we winter with out any problems . very good experience and we will be back .
1	2nd , it 's because of great leadership provided by the owner , that creates such an atmosphere in which these employees work . now on to the fare served here . if you would like to enjoy a " home cooked meal " in a restaurant setting , it doesn 't get any better than this . i brought friends from out of state here for their first taste of vegas . it happened to be my first visit here also . we all were most impressed by this off the strip hidden jewel . this will be our go to place for breakfast in a peaceful atmosphere . thanks for a job well done to the owner and staff here at mr. mamas .
1	went with the fatty brisket and ribs with a mac and cheese side . ton of food so i didn 't finish everything , but it all was great . nice job .
1	we started out the the chicken nachos , i ordered the one-eyed jack and we finished with the outrageous banana split ( coward 's portion ) . all was awesome . i loved them each . the nachos were huge and the sandwich was even bigger and extra tasty the banana split was everything you can hope for and the cowards portion was big enough for my wife and i. next time i 'm in vegas i will be sure to come back here for more . my advice to those who want to try this place is do not go on a budget ... don 't cheat your self treat your self
1	if you have not tried flatiron , i invite you , just a solid good place ... it 's not stuffy , but it 's dressier than finding " norm " at the end of the bar everyday ... while other new " pop up 's " are still finding their way in in davidson ... this has a good menu for very diverse tastes .. indoor & outdoor seating , good place to people watch ... extensive beer list , for those whom it matters to .
1	1st let me say that serve kyla was one of the best people to serve us in a while she was spot on with the drinks and when it came down to food she told us what was good now on to the food it was a 10 all day

1	although we weren 't super hungry , we stopped by on our last night in town . we originally started " light " with 1lb of king crab and 1 / 2 lb of shrimp but ended up enjoying our meal to the point where we had to have more . even though we were rushing to catch a show , we could not resist ordering another round of the very flavorful crab in the hot n juicy seasoning with some corn fritters on the side . the seasoning is sooo good that you will want to sop it all up with everything in site . awesome place to go if you like seafood with a kick ! yum !

1	party of 11 and our waiter really took care of us ! ! i had the king crab with the trifecta , and the 4th level of heat ( ghost ) , pretty damn hot and really very good ! everyone in our party really enjoyed their food ! if your looking for something different when eating your seafood , this is your place . warning if anyone in you party is not a seafood eater , all they have is chicken fingers , wings or a buffalo chicken sandwich that is none seafood .

1	located upstairs in the brand new home of the las vegas golden knights training facility , mckenzie river has the feel of a pub with the ambiance of a sports facility ! service is spot on and very attentive ! i got the stockman pizza with italian sausage , steak , bacon , mozzarella and cheddar cheese ! the original crust is light and flavorful ! the pizza sauce is amazing and bold in flavor ! i also tried the mud pie and of course it was amazing ! great views of both ice rinks too ! great place to eat and kick back ! i will be coming back and be a regular ! so glad this place is finally here ! welcome to summerlin !
1	located near sunset station & galleria mall this place is hopping ! 15 cars in the drive-thru @ 2 pm . but anyone who 's eaten at in & out knows -it 's always worth the wait . one of these days i 'm gonna order a 10x10 and see how long it takes to finish it ! today however i went for the double-double extra pickles & onion with sauce . my usual ! fantastic down to the last crumb of bun ! i hear there are now 7 locations throughout the valley-we could do with 10 more or the nice catering truck they have at in-n-out !
1	everyone was very polite , chef even came to table to ask how the food was . wife had pulled pork , i enjoyed the meat tortolleni and both were very good , even had enough to take home for another meal . will definitely be back . by the way they will even take reservations for only 2 people .
1	i had chicken strips and grilled shrimp my sides were black beans and mac n cheese . it was all scrumptious with healthy size portions . the cocktails were amazing . i definately plan on returning .
1	fantastic chicken kabobs and lentil soup . served quickly . great service .

1	so happy i made a reservation because it seems as waiting it unpleasant .
1	i ordered the so cal sandwich . it came with fries . best sandwich i have ever had and best fries too . the bacon had a hint of sweetness which complimented the grilled chicken which was plump and juicy . the bread was great too . it 's a messy sandwich , but well worth it ! ! ! i will definitely be back soon and will tell friends about this place .
1	an old high school friend works here . i 've eaten it all , memphis , eastern nc , lexington , you name it . this is as good as it gets . had the pulled pork sandwich with the sweet tomato sauce and brunswick stew . porky was very smoky and flavorful . the stew was perfect . thick , just the way i like it . took home a pound of the pork . i 'll try the ribs next time . you will not be disappointed ! ! !
1	groupon deal . saw none of the negatives on other yelp reviews . waitress was kayla . one of the best . polite and professional . food was outstanding and abundant . was impressed enough that bought groupon same day .
1	we sat down she tended to us quickly the menu has a variety of foods and drinks on it i chose saddies stuffed breasts and it was amazing we had mozzarella sticks for an appetizer and it was amazing my friends had gotten a shepard 's pie and the other an egg burger . how ever our waitress bri . was very friendly and helpful for when it came to figuring out what to eat . if your looking for a fun place to get great food and great service that not only looks great but is just as good as there looks i definitely recommend the tilted kilt on 87th in peoria . and a shout out to bri . for the memorial time .
1	i can 't believe i have lived in pittsburgh my whole life and never came here to eat until now . we had really good service and just walked in and got a table immediately ( 5 : 00 on a monday ) . ordered the bumbleberry beer and frickles ( which could serve 4 people easily ) as an app . also had the pittsburgh salad and wondered when the waiter asked if we were sharing it ? ! and then it came and was huge ! ! we were offered a sample of the holly jolly beer and it was good too . this place is a must go ! !
1	service was good , could have been better but with it being full understandable . great environment music playing tvs with the music video . food was great had ribs and pulled pork combo , came with fries . two side one of beans and coleslaw , these are small dipping sauce container size . however was definitely full afterwards , no room for dessert .
1	looking forward to many , many , many more . portions were great and opted to eat at bar . bar staff was by far the best around , knowledgeable of beverages and menu alike . good food and great atomphsere . had the lamb burger at medium and it was awesome . so , stop reading this review and get inside and enjoy yourself . you won 't be disappointed .
1	i had the shrimp burger ; as if it was made in the sf bay area ! the cole slaw was also very good ; not overly spicy . ( 2 ) the selection of beer and whiskey was amazing ! ( 3 ) the staff was friendly and knowledgeable . just sitting there listening to jamie and crystal giving lectures on the whiskeys and the beers was worth it !
1	seth is new to vegas and the west in general . he is 20 years old and from kentucky . i am sure this is a big deal coming west and getting a job with so few hours . so anyone lucky enough to be served by seth , please give him encouragement and a hand up . if people did that along my sons path in life .... i would surely appreciate it .
1	the tuna stack is my favorite ! 2 . the butternut squash raviloi is amazing ! 3 . fish tacos are good not amazing . but good ! service is 10 / 10 i would highly reccomend this place .
1	the works bloody mary 2 . in house banana muffins 3 . habla diablo potatoes 4 . carrot cake french toast 5 . tuna melt guest service , large food portions , great pricing , delicious food and kid family friendly . worth the wait if busy !
1	there burgers are so good , and their sweet potato fries are even better . staff is always awesome , love ohso , ill be back again and again
1	they serve delirium beer here , huge plus . 2 . food is fantastic , when my brother comes to visit it 's our go-to place 3 . service is great , but better to go earlier in the day and get a window seat : )
1	2 ) when we first arrived the staff and owner were so pleasant and greeted us when we first walked in . 3 ) super cheap and extremely attentive . they were constantly on top of our coffee refill and ensured everything was to our liking . we ordered the breakfast special of 2 eggs , 2 pancakes and 2 pieces of bacon . not realizing it doesn 't come w home fries , we asked if we could change the order to have home fries and vickie was sweet enough to take care of us . they 're open 24 / 7 , 365 . i am definitely coming back ! ! : )
1	i had prime rib sandwich and my wife had the chicken salad . i believe the waitress name was lametri . she was very pleasant and food came quickly . the area was clean and everybody seem to be working on the same team i would recommend this for a great lunch
1	# 1 with everything on it minus the black olives has been my favorite sandwich for going on a decade now .
1	burgers were delicious and service was great ! will definitely be coming back here .
1	from beginning to end it was an incredible experience ! some of the best food and service in pittsburgh . highly recommend trying the bone in ribeye , fries , and ratatouille ! they also have an exceptional raw bar !
1	seriously ... healthy and cute . i 'll be honest ... i 've only tried the breakfast buzz ( most delicious protein shake ever ) . i promise you that if i 'm ever in south scottsdale for lunch or dinner d 'lish will be my first preference . i 've looked over the menu and everything looks wonderful . i live in east mesa and work in north scottsdale ... i go out of my way to get a buzz and will continue to do so . highly recommended !
1	and hummus . open late . free delivery . i order from here a few times a year and that 's all i 've had honestly . and it 's smackin ' . i would like to try the moroccan chicken pizza with dates ... and i 've heard good things .
1	every bite or drink of everything i 've ordered is mouth watering good ! ! ! definitely give the shrimp grits appetizer a try ! you will never have grits like this anywhere !
1	you need advance reservations . 2 . its a little pricey ( dinner for two with two glasses of wine each , two course meal , coffee and tip was about $ 225 us . ) 3 you might have a problem if you are afraid of heights . very worth doing at least once . the view is amazing and the food and very good . we sat in a table right next to the window which as nice . they suggest business casual dress but many people were dressed very casually ( sneakers and shorts ) .
1	you need to ask for cole to be your server ! he made our night . 2 . don 't pay attention to the reviews discussing the prices . it 's a great restaurant with outstanding food and worth the price 3 . the portions are huge ! we came home with a " bag " of doggie boxes ! highly recommend .
1	great cheap late night eats ! sliders , onion straws , fries and beer $ 2 eac hi went for the full-size burgers this time however , we ordered the cheddar & mushroom and the greeen chile burger.-both were fantastic the warm potato chips with cheese & onion was quite delicious as well ! ! service is good , the atmosphere is great for people watching and is really nice in the fall here in vegas since its an outdoor bar . be sure to check them out this coming weekend 10 / 17 at desert breeze park at the bite of las vegas ! !
1	after spending the day hiking in the grand canyon , everything about this place hit the spot . my party ordered a few different wraps , a rice bowl , a couple salads , and a rice plate . the base ingredients had flavor beyond what you 'd get from your grocery store produce , and that flavor was enhanced by the best yogurt sauce i have had in all my trips to greek restaurants . for my own dish , the gyro woke up your taste buds when it hit your tongue . in short , the great greek has a commitment to both price and flavor , something that 's not nearly as commonplace as it used to be .
1	tori is , by far , the best , most attentive , fun and sexy bartender in the city ! catch her from thursday through sunday evenings . you will not be disappointed .
1	i myself have the filet , which is by far my favorite piece of steak at any steak place i go to ... i must say though by far the best i 've had & i live in the bay area we have some pretty good steal spots here as well . deserts here are fantastic as well , the mac and cheese was amazing , when i come back to vegas who knows when that will be , but i will be sure to stop in and have another meal at chef ramsey 's !
1	2009 : this is the golden nugget from chicago but in las vegas . perfect menu for standard american food . the place is super busy all the time and you can have any menu item 24 / 7 . the staff all seemed in a good mood .
1	adam richman - amazing sandwich . fried chicken , ham , honey , pesto , avocado and swiss . definitely will be back . nice break from the other basic sandwich spots .
1	she was excited to find out that it was our first time there and took time to help us navigate their many menu options to choose from . while the first impression was excellent the food was even better . brisket was so tender and flavorful , kc sammy ( barbecue sandwich with a twist ) was delicious and the footlong corn dog was awesome ! the portions were plentiful and the sauce options fit all of our tastes . we never felt rushed even though it was after closing time . service 5 , food 5 , experience 5 . we will be back .
1	hop knot and blackened salmon blt = amazing ! ! ! great service , friendly bartenders and beer selection on point . definitely stopping by whenever i travel through phx .
1	came here on a sunday morning for an impromptu brunch with a handful of very hungry friends , and we were not disappointed ! we were seated right away , which was impressive for a group our size in a crowded restaurant . we split the pimento cheese fries ( definitely add bacon ! ) and the fried pickles , both of which were delish and exactly what we all wanted after a night out . the staff was friendly , attentive , and super fun . would definitely recommend it as a weekend day drinking spot with good , quick food .
1	i don 't even care about everything else . that gets five stars alone . our server was also so friendly and engaging , especially to a drunk , obnoxious group . the crab legs were cooked well and so delicious , even better than the last buffet i visited where it was $ 35pp . there may not be as many other options , but everything was still pretty tasty . i was also a fan of the salmon and mussels .
1	the cereal was fantastic , not to mention the bagels as well ! there 's a toaster oven conveniently right by them ! toasted my bagel to perfection ! only thing i will say is that the restrooms were being remodeled , after downing a few apple juices ( which were splendid ) i really had to go !
1	from wetsons ( for those of you old enough to remember ) , to shakeshack , smashburger , five guys , sonic , etc . today , i have never experienced a burger as delicious as the brie / wildmushroom burger that i was served today . the staff couldnt have been nicer and the owner maury , forget it . he sat next to us at the bar while we ate and couldnt have been friendlier or more accommodating . he even walked us out of the pub to help us find the metro subway . we will be back for sure .
1	ive been coming here for years and its always consistent- good food and lots of it ! i got the eggs benedict , which is my go to. it was delicious. i go to vegas at least twice a year so i cant wait to be back in august .
1	i love how their specialty rolls are included ... and the rolls are made fresh ( compared to most sushi buffets ) . my favorite rolls were the love affair roll and the monster roll . don 't forget to get a dessert too ! their creme brulee is delicious ! : )
1	bone-in ribeye with mashed potatoes and asparagus is incredible . made to perfection . somehow this is the best side salad ever also .
1	the server 's name slips my mind , but she had the row of booths on the right side of the bar when you come in and she was the best server that i have had in a long time . professional , attentive and even wanted to shake my hand and thank me for my service as we were leaving ... which was a first for me . the food was excellent and i had an very pleasant experience and will be back real soon . thank you .
1	great hospitality , quick seating . ordered crawfish 2 lbs was way to hot for me ( hubby ate ) , so the waiter ordered very mild for me 1 lb , didn 't have to wait to long for my ordered . as i waited i chatted with people next to us , the young man ordered the very hot crawfish ............. he said he couldn 't man up to it , it was to hot for him ( but he ate it anyway while sweating ) . i must go back . i want the crawfish again but wanna try something else on the menu . certainly recommend when in vegas and wanting crawfish ! ! !
1	service was friendly and food came out within a reasonable time . i would return and try other dishes as this is what i think of when italian deli comes to mind .
1	next time i 'll take it to go , maybe heat up it more than they did . tall , like lasagna is supposed to be , wonderful italian sausage . i haven 't had lasagna this good in 10 years . in fact , writing this review now it occurs to me i 'll go back there again tonight . what better recommendation can you give a restaurant than ... " i 'm going to go back again and again " ? defalco 's occasionally has a misstep but i 'm telling you this is a solid , solid pick ! and great lasagna !
1	lentil soup , gyros , kabobs , hummus , etc . everything is just terrific ! owner is the nicest guy you 'll ever meet . so are his wife & teenage kids .
1	22 ounces ribeye steak was absolutely perfect and filet mignon was melting in the mouth. service was spotless and busboy was all around our table make sure to make our dinner an excellent experience. beautiful atmosphere in tree house make it even more memorable
1	shared scallops , smoked salmon and cream cheese , meditteranean bass , grilled shrimp , fresh fruit and real greek yogurt . so worth it . i 'd definately recommend the place . nice ambiance and located on the 3rd floor at the cosmo where all the other restaurants are located . would have never known about the place if weren 't for our good friend jimmy - professional foodie . highly recommended and service was as expected .
1	$ 22 seafood buffet was excellent with crawfish , raw oysters , shrimp , and tons and tons of crap legs !
1	all the food we had was fantastic and definitely worth the cost . you cannot go wrong for breakfast at this place . very nice decor with a garden right in the middle . all the food was fresh and placed in a way that looked fancy without having the cheap buffet look which it isn 't . will definitely come again on my next vegas trip .
1	always been one of my favorite places in phoenix . i brought my out of town family here and they were treated to an unbelievable night of drinking and fun . the owner treated my mother some free boxing lessons ! ! ! could not have asked for a better night ! ! ! ! !
1	prices are great , service is great . i really wish they had an east side location .
1	i visited this restaurant twice last week for lunch . service and food were great ! i read the other reviews about there service , so maybe my expectations were low , but i must say the service was fast , the wait staff personalities were definitely in tune with me . by the way , the burger was very fresh tasting and 2nd only to the white chocolate grill on mayo .
1	one of the best chili dogs i have ever had- very clean & fast service . you must try it out when you are on fremont street !
1	love the king cut prime rib here : 13.99 with beer . the service is always great .
1	what more can you ask ? la banquise is easily one of the best poutine spot in montreal , if not the best . the only con would be that they only accept cash . i have only tried the pogo poutine so far , which was asolute bliss .
1	? tasty bbq and sides galore . customer service to match their great eats . i love finding gems like rsbbq - definitely need to be in the know to find this joint !
1	this buffet also have good sweets too. if you want sushi and crabs this is not a place to go .
1	6 fried catfish . a bunch of fried mushrooms . done done and done ! ! ! not your kfc or popeyes . you can tell this place has a secret family recipe ( the lady who rings you up is from chicago and is super nice ... she calls all of her customers " baby " ) . the taste and texture is something else ! off the strip quite a ways but consider this recovery fried chicken after a night or nights of binge drinking and early mornings in vegas !
1	this place is absolutely amazing , all of the food is cooked to order and tastes 100 percent like it does in philly . love this place . btw ... the onion rings are to die for .
1	but i 'll go on , they have other things on the menu too , hot dogs , burgers , poutine , milk shakes and all that . it 's where you go when you want some down and dirty grub and preferably when you are drunk . apparently some major nhl players used to eat here ( patrick roy ? ) . i 've only once ate here in the morning .
1	i ordered the $ 9.99 prime rib . it came with soup or salad and a desert . drink extra . i sat at the counter so service was prompt and friendly . entire tab was $ 13.51 . prime rib came with potatoes and green beans .... it was good .
1	? ! this is brilliant ! ! everyone needs to be able to get poutine any time of the day . it 's 4 am , it 's poutine time . it 's 9 am , it 's poutine time . 5pm you say , oh yeah that 's poutine time . obviously the poutine here is amazing . you can 't go wrong with anything you pick . and try some the local and in house beer while you wait for that poutine .
1	spaghetti thursday is a great deal ! staff is friendly , bit dicey but always beats ihop
1	they have an amazing staff . on my last visit i had a ruben sandwich and i devoured it ! the chicken wings were amazing too .
1	24 hours and the best subs in las vegas ! ! ! ! !
1	buttermilk pancakes , cheesy grits , crazy bloody mary 's , breakfast all day and night . seat yourself and self serve water / bloody mary toppings , environment with great corner view of state street and people watching . need i say more . give it a try
1	i wish i had tried this place earlier . i 've tried many different options , and haven 't been disappointed yet . i highly recommend this place for people who want to sit down and enjoy a healthy meal , or someone on the go . very delicious and worth the price .
1	702-333-8000exceptional chicken fettuccine alfredo ! white pizza is to die for ! ! ! everything is homemade i love it . 24hr delivery and pick up . the owner is super friendly ! ! ! 5 stars ! ! ! ! !
1	5.50 for a philly cheesesteak , as of 2-27-2015 . now i 'm a man who doesn 't like onions , but the onions in my sandwich were sweet and succulent . exactly what i needed for a late-night meal .
1	love love love this spot ! if you haven 't been here yet , this will become favorite spot to hit as soon as you get into vegas . it 's definitely ours ! everything is great here . enjoy !
1	the cheese curds are squeaky and the fries are crispy ; perfect as a base layer before hitting up st denis or before crashing into bed after a night on st denis . every time i go to montreal i head on over to la banquise . the only reason why i almost gave this place 4 stars is because of the ' no liquor on the patio ' policy , but in the summer , i guess it makes sense .
1	i have enjoyed both of my meals here . once drunk and another hungover : / but both times the food tasted great . service was fast , friendly and excellent . for me , having a full drink is always a big determination on my rating of service and here i am not sure my drink was ever passed half way empty before i was asked if i wanted another . thumbs up for me . their breakfast was great . bacon was thick cut and cooked perfectly . i will be getting and extra side of bacon my next meal here .
1	you can 't beat this place for breakfast ! plus the waitress are movers ! and they don 't screw around. hit it up no matter the time , you 'll be happy ! french toast is pretty good for using regular white bread , no texas toast but oh well. everything is amazingly cheap ! but great quality. peace
1	24 hr real quebec very own poutine , what more can i say , staff friendly , vast options , food basically ideal for after hrs , solid all around
1	since there is enough said about the cheesesteaks , thought i would add something different . pop 's has the best breakfast sandwich ! ! steak , eggs , cheese ! ! i love it and it has saved me from the hangover monster on more than a few mornings ! also , the turkey sandwich is top flight ! the bread is amazing , and makes sense that they bring it in from back east . i don 't eat " fast food " and i consider pop 's to be anything but typical fast food , the higher quality is obvious , and i don 't mind paying for it . highly recommended !
1	greeted by a really nice employee .. was super generous with the veggies , and though we ordered two separate 6in sandwiches ( it was the same sandwich , just different bread ) , was charged as only as one footlong . first time in vegas where i finally feel like i 'm coming out ahead ! woohoo !
1	pizza is alway perfect , cavatelli are amazing and the house salad and dressing are a must . have also had catering for large events and again everything was perfect . a true family run business where the guests are treated like family .
1	she quickly saw my prime rib was overdone and promptly brought me out a new one . suze is the best ! ! be prepared for a thirty or forty min wait . otherwise you can check in line on their app possibly ..
1	must get : popcorn shrimp , pulled pork , brisket , ribs , bacon potato salad , mac n cheese , mashed potato , corn bread and banana pudding ! !
1	best buffet i 've ever been to . the decoration is beautiful as well . this place even satisfy my mom and sister , who are very picky when it comes to buffet . thank you wicked spoon for making my family happy !
1	don 't come hungover or you won 't get your money 's worth . 2 . you can keep asking for more champagne . 3 . just don 't be rude or break anything . * slaps forhead * anybody who doesn 't enjoy bottomless champagne , i do not consider my friend .
1	that has to say something about the quality of the place . of course , a trip to cleveland isn 't complete without a pit stop to slyman 's . this time i managed to drag the in-laws and they were equally as happy . you just can 't get a reuben anywhere else like you can at slyman 's . i wish they would ship their corned beef . i would certainly be a loyal customer .
1	the burgers are tasty and not too greasy ( the grilled cheese is pretty decadent as well ) , the fries and onion rings are awesome , and the drinks are just right . good service , reasonable prices , and delicious food . love it !
1	could easily feed two people . my first authentic greek food experience and it did not disappoint . the kebab meat was amazingly seasoned , juicy and tasteful . the feta cheese was the obvious standout with the salad and the greek fries ! the atmosphere is great and the staff is friendly and very welcoming . highly recommended !
1	servings are good for 2 people . price is reasonable ranges fr $ 8- $ 15.defitinely going back w / out of town visitors ! !
1	the food here definitely outshines the decor and portion sizes were massive . everything is market fresh and cooked to order . will definitely return for their rotating menu .
1	i liiiiike ! ate here two nights in a row while i was in vegas and yuppp , you read correctly , wings are only 25 cents each !
1	it was amazing food , service and overall experience . the sangria was amazing as well . we recently got married and before went there with family and friends to celebrate where we first went out . everything was fabulous ! the food , ambiance , service and again , the sangria . we all got different entrees and everyone loved theirs ! we had asked about a kids menu and although they did not have one they offered us several options that worked ! above and beyond ! they even provided him with some entertainment during the wait ( which was not long for an adult , but can be for a child ) . i would highly recommend this place !
1	yeah , if you haven 't figured it out yet , it 's really good ! if you are debating on trying it , just do it ! the food is amazing !
1	went in expecting a mediocre selection but came away more surprised . other buffets with this selection don 't charge anything less than around $ 40 per person . getting my own drinks is nice because i know the glass will be clean and only i handled it . thanks monte carlo .
1	the staff there is super friendly & makes everyone fill welcome + they can make any drinks under the sun , so make sure to stop by when your around you will not be disappointed ! ! !
1	top sirloin and picania are my favorites . come hungry , pace yourself , skip the meal prior to ensure you can engorge . nice staff , good salads . convenient to strip
1	good food for a ridiculously low price . my hubby and fil had the corned beef hash and cleaned their plates . they liked the coffee as well . very friendly service with obvious regulars .
1	shut your muthableepin mouf ! for $ 2 it don 't have to even be that good , but for a sit in diner thats as good as it gets .
1	they have the best brisket i 've had outside of texas . came to find out the pitmaster is from oklahoma , and has won awards for his brisket . the ribs , sausage , and pulled pork are spot on too .
1	along w / 2 draft beers from their own brewery . all for under $ 20 ! ! ! & it was sooo yummy ! cant beat it : o )
1	i trusted yelp and it was just as great as the reviews were . we had breakfast . i had the waffle breakfast ! what ever you do say yes to the apple cinnamon butter with it ! it was so good . my bf had the steak and eggs ! steak was a tad bit dry but would try it again ! service was great and on top of things . host even open the door for us on the way out . they also have a full bar . can 't wait to go back !
1	came here again yesterday with my family and since my son is sensitive to many things the manager came out and asked us exactly what he was allergic to in order to make something custom just for my son . he was so accommodating that i just had to write another review on it . i had to order my usual talapia and it was fantastic as well . i also did not know that they ship in new seafood daily and everything here is homemade , which is probably why this place is full of awesomeness !
1	the triple beef taco is so good that i just told a visiting co-worker that they had to get one before he returned to michigan .
1	sports on tvs ! lots of tvs ! there 's just this special something with chain restaurants where you know exactly what you 're expecting . no complaints here ! staff are very accommodating and nice . woo hoo !
1	great way to start off your morning . i 've heard their lunch isn 't half bad i 'll have to check it out one of these days .
1	cajun on the teezers with side o ranch . damn i 'm fat
1	amazing crepes , good coffee selection , my boyfriend loved the meat lovers hash skillet . we were stuffed ! love this place !
1	free soup , free bread ! ! i love this place . the meal portions are so generous ! ! the workers are so nice . downside in a not so nice area and it has no air conditioner
1	the service is warm and they do a good job supplying samples and water while you wait . the beef ribs are a must have while the sides disappointed a little . if your looking to support small business and want authentic bbq with please smile , bring something to keep yourself company while you wait .
1	open 24 / 7 . i thought my sandwich was great ! ( breakfast blt ) and the girls i dined with loved their breakfast sandwiches , too . it 's good for what it is-- a fast food sandwich place . they had lots of options & are very reasonably priced for a vegas strip eatery . and they 're open 24 / 7 .
1	loved it as usual . the staff here is awesome , always so nice and friendly . thanks again ! !
1	$ 2 mimosas ! ! excellent service . our group was seated a minute after we got there ( we had 5 in our group ) and we sat outside . beautiful saturday to have brunch . the menu selection was excellent . i had the steak & eggs benedict- and it was perfect . and the potatoes that came with it were delicious ! ps . $ 2 mimosas ! ! !
1	the rigatoni is just divine . dining room has an old hollywood feel , glamorous and gorgeous . service was excellent . during my trip to vegas i ate here 2x in the span of 3 days . it 's that good . call ahead though , u will need a reservation . first time i ate there we ate at the bar because we had no reservation . equally great service , but the dining room is so beautiful that eating within the room is an experience in itself
1	we were there in early may . great burger , better fries . get the fry sampler , you won 't regret it ! with so many great food options in vegas it 's hard to think about coming back to the same place twice , but we considered it more than once . a must try amongst many great food options in vegas .
1	the oatmeal is the grandest oatmeal you 'll ever have , so simple yet so delicious . the " oatmeal " part is actually quinoa which provides a great amount of protein and will keep you full until lunch time , if not later . extremely healthy oatmeal that can 't be compared to other places . overall , such a quaint environment ... their name speaks for itself when it comes to the food . the " house style " frittata is also pretty d 'lish ; it 's served atop hash browns and toast , and topped with a spicy sauce . coffee drinks are above-par .
1	this place is amazing . the big bear is one of the most tremendous breakfasts i 've ever had , the local scrambler is awesome , and the waitresses are pretty !
1	when we reached the front of the line we were greeted by the friendly staff and explained that it would be about a 20 min wait . wanting to try the burgers we put our name in , wait time was about 10 min . food was delicious , staff was friendly , service was great !
1	i 'm a huge fan of the " pesto " white pizza nom nom nom ! i highly recommend dining here
1	2nd mother 's day in a row and service and food was amazing as always
1	don 't ask anyone here about pizza , they love their food so much , that you 'll end up in a 45 minute discussion about the intricacies of dough and varieties of flour . but , actually , if you love food as much as they do , it will be a well spent 45 minutes . the chef gave me pointers on sour dough starters and my own homemade bread and pizzas are thankful . awesome place . will be back whenever we are in the area . try the homemade lemonade . best i 've ever had .
1	service is outstanding , food comes out fresh , hot and lightening fast , sauces are yummarama and it 's a great value / large portions ! oh yah , the hush puppies are super tasty which they serve complimentary . overall exceptional experience the only thing that everyone didn 't rave above were the fried pickles , we just didn 't expect them to be soooo spicy . what we did rave about was the pulled pork sand ( xl one is plenty to split ) , the brisket , ribs and pulled turkey . we will def be back ! omg i almost forgot to brag about the onion rings !
1	stuck with the holy chuck ( bacon caramelized onions and two patties ) , no extra toppings as suggested , fries , coke in a bottle and a salted caramel and nutella milkshake for desert . i would eat here once a week if i lived close enough . they are the dreamiest .

1	this place is definitely top 3 favorite places to eat . we enjoyed their amazing appetizers including cauliflower and corn dishes that are to die for . the hamburgers and fries were awesome . they really know how to cook the perfect fry . for dessert we had popcorn profiteroles and they are unlike any dessert you 'll have anywhere else . a truly wonderful and unique experience . our server , justen , loves his job , the food , and taking care of customers .

1	the first time was eh so we were hesitant to come back .. with glad we gave it a 2nd try . . our waiter was craig and he is great ! we used a groupon and he treated us like we were paying full price . he didn 't skimp on the service at all . the meat guys are nice too ! we left the place stuffed and could barely walk lol . thank you , craig for your awesome service ! we will be back ! : )
1	2nd time at this place and it was great before and even better now. the lentil soup is absolutely delicious. i ordered extra to go so i could have some more for dinner. food looks and tastes fresh and the guys manning the grill looked like professional chefs at work. i will be coming back again and again. after the second time here i think it 's got la shish beat. don 't get me wrong , la shish is good as well but this place has it beat by 3 / 4 stars .
1	the food and service as awesome as the last time i was here . i ordered the chicken bellagio and it was amazing . calamari was great as well .. luv it ! ! last visit i ordered the chicken madeira . it was soooo goood ..
1	we shared the beef tartare ( delicious to share ) , prosciutto pizza ( great the next day ) and short ribs ( good but i doubt i would order them again ) . i would highly recommend all . great eye candy too , there 's lots of male workers looking fine , which is nice compared to the typical place where it 's primarily good looking females next time i 'm trying the jerk shrimp

1	great food , great service , and clean ! first time i enjoyed the 3 meal combo special . 2nd time we did family style plate for 4 people . i just loved the flavors and how fresh it tasted . hummus is a must ... they make it right ! the lentil soup is perfect ... especially now that 's fall season . salad is so fresh ! portion is more than enough and so worth it . give it a try and you won 't regret it .
1	the service is great and the food is wonderful . it 's tucked in the corner off of shea and the 51 and i would have never found it if it wasn 't for yelp . if you like bar bbq you have to try this place out . killer drinks too !

1	i 'd like to give a special shoutout to colin the manager . it 's absolutely amazing when a business owner takes such a active role in customers and service . stop by and try the 1 . with the " runny egg " and some garlic fries and you 'll love it ! ! !
1	2nd day in a row ! ! ! consecutively amazing food and service ! ! today i tried the pesto pizza ... which my server highly recommended and happily amended for me haha ... no cheese , added tofu and it was awesome ! ! she even brought a huge side of extra pesto sauce without me requesting it ! i can 't say enough great things about this place ! they make eating clean , healthy and vegan-ish sooo easy !
1	5 star food with 5 star service ! luz was our server , she was welcoming and accommodating . we were needy ( food to eat-in , food to go , + we had a rambunctious 2 year old with us ) but she handled everything in stride and with a smile .... this was a great start to our day after obviously being beat down by alcohol , loooooong walks , and little sleep . sunshine cafe we love you !

1	started with the goat cheese queso fundito which is always amazing and was treated to their amazing bread basket . blue corn muffins and jalapeno corn bread are both delicious . their roasted corn soup was truly decadent . liquid corn bread . entree was the cornmeal chile relleno which i had last time and this was even better ( the only vegetarian entree ) stuffed with roasted eggplant and manchego cheese on top of a delicious red pepper sauce . finished with the pear buttermilk upside down cake that tasted like christmas , and the deep dish banana cream pie which is exactly as it sounds . both perfect desserts . oh and about 5 glasses of their cactus pear iced tea .
1	two of us had the short rib . loved it ! ! also had two very unique deserts . one was peanut butter something , the other was a decadent cheesecake . great place for birthdays , christmas parties etc .
1	girlfriend and i stopped by for a meal the other day l , not knowing much about this place . have to say it was way , way above our expectations ! staff is very friendly , food is delicious , and prices are good as well . loco moco is by far the best i 've had from a local place ! totally recommend it to anyone looking for a quick bite or a big dinner !

1	yummy breakfast , fast friendly staff ! the wait staff are pretty nice and usually typical breakfast places have grumpy staff ( i don 't blame them i 'm not a morning person lol ) staff seems to very well organized & restaurant is clean and happy ! i have had the same waitress both visits , she is very sweet & told me the protein pancakes were nothing to be afraid of ! and she was right- very delicious ! love they serve cocktails & beer !
1	i was surprised when i was able to reserve a table the same night when other plans backfired . even nicer , free corkage on the bottle we brought because we sat down at 9pm ! service is so on spot , polite and not pushy at all . food of course was done perfectly , served at the proper temperature , and delicious ! people at first glance may say this place is expensive .... but these days its no more expensive than some newly hyped up restaurant that is still trying to figure things out with their menu and service . for the price the value is certainly there . see for yourself .
1	nice to have a different style of food , delicious southern style for a change . nice having lunch with my son ! ! i ordered the chicken wrap . wishing the food would come out just a little bit quicker , but on that note ! ! ! ! delicious
1	i refuse to even share them with the hubby , he can get his own . eventually i 'll get to trying the other menu items .
1	one of the best pizza places in town . placed my order via an android app . was given a call within 3 mins of placing order to confirm i placed my order correct . 1st i ordered i was given an hour delivery time frame due to the busy day of week . my order was delivered within 30 mins . cutting their estimated time in half . 2nd time i had a pickup order and was given a 25 min estimation yet my order was done within 15 mins and was hot and ready when i arrived . their prices can be a little pricey for specialty made pizzas but well worth the price .
1	was in the area for a bowling tournament so a group of us decided to come early and get a round of golf in . the course is hilly and challenging with readable and fairly flat greens . but , as the name suggests , what a grand view of both the course as well as the surrounding areas . carts are in excellent shape and provide you with electronic scoring and course gps . the folks here take pride in their course and take very good care of it .
1	this place was 3.5 starts the first time i came , but stepped up large tonight . waitress was righteous and very fun . food was all excellent . caesar salad tasty--got with tomatoes big $ on that , fettuccini carbornara with bacon n smoky cream flavor . can 't wait for the leftovers ! ! the white pizza is that star though . the crust / dough is heavenly and the flavor is top shelf . i don 't throw those accolades out easily , especially on pie , but this joint serves it up . good vibe , great service , phenomenal food . ill be back .
1	many delicious items on the menu . i 'm definitely coming back .
1	the food is really good . there pancakes wow huge and yummy .
1	very nice gentleman took my order . even let me order off the breakfast menu before 11pm . allowed me to take my time , to look at menu . didn 't rush me . i appreciate that . i know people expect " fast " all the time . i appreciate him taking the time . he did forget to give me my daughters milk . i am in line getting it now . very nice man . accidents happen .
1	have had the fish and chips and caesar salad with salmon , really fresh and big portions ! food is delicious and wait staff is awesome . have had holly both times and she is so sweet ! great place !
1	we love it ! endless salad ingredients , everything perfectly fresh . salad bowl enough for 2 . don 't bother with the grilled cheese , just ok , not great . the fries were better the 1st time . today they were way too done , crunchy , crispy . need to reset timer on the fryer . employees all very pleasant . will go back again & again
1	definitely wins the 5 star review today for deliciousness .
1	their sandwiches are so yummy and the side of greens is awesome ! i loved the tuna salad sandwich . the food is great quality and the ingredients taste so fresh.the service was great both visits and the place is cozy and quaint . its a great lunch spot and i will definitely be back !
1	it was a monday , so we got a seat right away . it was busy , but not packed . our server , michael was outstanding . fast , friendly & professional , but not stuffy . we had the banana bread pancakes & the garden of eden omelette . they both tasted great , the pancakes came with banana butter , which was great on the toast from my omelette . highly recommend both . a great place for breakfast as many can agree , as some days the wait is quite long for a table .
1	the buffalo egg rolls are to die for . i had the pecan crusted salad with chicken , huge and very good . my husband had the turkey melt and would order again . their homemade chips are delicious . westlake location is just as good ! ! ! already planning our next visit .
1	we ordered the baby back ribs and they were simmered in thai spices . oh . em . gee . sooooo tender and delish . spicy goodness . the kids chicken strips are huge . the masala fries were perfection . this food is legit .
1	the food was fantastic and the service phenomenal ! highly recommended !
1	hostess , wait staff and russ , the manager all very attentive . food awesome . decided i 'm not going to any other restaurant in the area unless i know for a fact it is of this caliber . this is the only restaurant i have been to that never disappoints .
1	don 't miss it . don 't eat anything that day before dinner . take lots of people so you can try one of everything .
1	not the place to go if you are trying to save some money but fun for a splurge night out . the wait staff and hostesses give impeccable service . i was particularly impressed with mohamabu ( sp ? ) . he kept this pancetta bread loving girl well stocked all night and seemed to actually really enjoy and take pride in his work . food was amazing - perfectly cooked steak , delicious truffle fingerling potatoes , and finished off with the most ridiculously melty rich yummy sticky toffee pudding . the music was also great !
1	get the american style kobe from idaho and you will be happy . best steakhouse in vegas !
1	misters outside . fast service . gr8 tasting salted caramel / cookie dough ! awesome as always just like the scottsdale waterfront location . there tends to be a line especially at night . order via ubereats and you don 't have to wait in line ! great location next to kona grill across from the wine room . parking garage directly across the street ! cookie dough is fave mix in !
1	i am glad i did ! ! service was 5 starts for sure ! nathan was our server and he was amazing . checked on us frequently and or drinks were always full . the food was also good ... we order the fondue again , cheese was amazing this time . zucchini fritters with aioli were very good . burger had good flavor and fries were great . lastly the carnitas were also very tasty . i was hesitant to come here again after my last experience , but the second time was amazing ! we will come back here again for sure !
1	rare for us to all find something we want . my duaghter got lobster mac and cheese . we all taste each other 's meals the mac and cheese was yum . and as evidence of how we enjoyed it was the only thing we brought back home . i had a fish fry , i really liked it , howard even made cocktail sauce for . my 12 year old son is a pescatarian and he got a dish he didn 't like they gladly took it off the bill . my wife got a burger and downed it all . usually she 'll bring 1 / 2 home . the owners howard and jamie make sure the experience is good . thanks
1	not sure why theyres so much negativity about this location , our every visit the staff has been amazing , the food was just as ordered and yummy ; no complaints here .
1	2nd visit to this place since moving across the coast ... it doesn 't disappoint ... drinks and food rock .... looking forward to coming here on sundays to watching football , refueling , and trying to get some homework done all the same time after sunday hikes .
1	the cannolis are the best ever . this is a definite keeper on our next visit .
1	did not disappoint ! i had the halibut special and she had the lamb chops . everything was scrumptious . best part was dessert ! we are locals and will be back !
1	this place is delicious . the property looks amazing , the food looks amazing , and it tastes just as amazing . love this hidden gem , i make to stop here whenever in arizona .

1	3 big thumbs up ! great fresh food ! great friendly and prompt service ! try the pancakes they 're big and awesome !
1	both were great , and plenty for both of us . we got the tarts comp , i guess to spread the word , and they were pretty special . great patio and fires . i could recommend the hop knot beer and the sauv blanc . both were great and hit the spot . will definitely return to try again .
1	1 ) food was fantastic . filet cobb salad was amazing and you can 't go wrong w anything salmon . 2 ) the staff and management could not have given better service . wife and i were out for our last date night before our baby boy got here ( due date is 3 days from now ) and there was a small delay in the kitchen before our entrees came out . literally maybe 20 min ..... we were just enjoying our time together and they went way above and beyond to compensate for the delay . hannah is a fantastic waitress . can 't say enough about there willingness to ensure we had a good experience .
1	my husband and kids love it here . so juicy , crispy , cooked to perfection . sunny is still in business for a reason . he knows what he is doing !
1	always excellent beers ( head hunter i.p.a ) and wonderful service .
1	+ 2 the cilantro pesto + 1 the red pepper pesto + 3 $ 6 entrees + 1 spinach stew : neither stewy , nor spinachy + 2 seafood kabobs , in wisconsin + 1 spacey sweet staff
1	i walked in one day excited to try something different . i ordered garlic pepper wings . i was served garlic parmesan by accident . thank god that happened . they were delicious . on a second visit , i invited friends to join . one of them ordered catfish . they asked me to try it , which i replied no . after a while , peer pressure cracked me . let 's just say , next time i will be asking for their order of catfish ... 14 flavors of wings , topped off with a side order of honey biscuits . can 't beat it ! thanks mike for bringing atl to the area ! ! !
1	just ordered from here for the first time and was very pleased ! had the philly cheese steak sandwich and supreme pizza and both were excellent ! the food was delivered very hot and tasty and even tho a little pricey with the delivery charge i still will most definently order from them again !
1	iceberg salad with tomatoes and cheese . choice of dressing . delicious chocolate lava cake with vanilla bean ice cream and chocolate sauce ( the dessert cost was in addition to the $ 34.95 steak dinner special for 2 as dessert was not included in the special ) all for under $ 50 including tax ( tip was extra ) . solid value for a delicious steak dinner for two off the las vegas strip . great service . warm and friendly atmosphere . clean restaurant . you will see a lot of locals here ( and locals know best ) . will definitely visit again after this first visit . outstanding ! !
1	my 86 year old father loves this place- huge portions , fairly priced .
1	1st class . loved the selection and the hot donuts ! worth the 90 minute drive . be sure to call ahead for reservations . they will be full
1	they made my eggs just as ordered and i was able to enjoy my friends without sending it back . meal was also quite affordable .. great stop for my first time there and in charlotte ..
1	some . great fish & chips , great po ' boys , so far have loved everything i have tried .
1	2 words , darn good , had the 1 / 2 rack , mac and cheese and yams , everything was good to the last bite , i must say the location is not the nicest but it is true to its roots as a local hometown bbq , so guys keep up the good work and you now have a customer for life even if i have to drive 20 miles and around the closed tunnels to get there , well worth it !
1	doner pita ! ! ! ! this is the only place i order this from . the salty , crispy , mixed meat with tzatziki and chewy pita . omg , so good ! thank god i don 't live close by , or i 'd be there 4 times a week ! then there is the marathon salad , you have to order this with any meal you get . the dressing is perfect . oh , and of course a side order of tzatziki to go with the complimentary garlic bread and your fries . the service is always great and meals are fairly priced . just go and try it ! you won 't regret it .
1	for only $ 20 too ! that said , i don 't recommend coming here for brunch if you have to be sober and productive later in the day ; ) the staff is great , the food is amazing , and did i mention unlimited mimosas ? ! just plan to wait for a table cause their sunday brunch is really popular-not just for the mimosas but for the atmosphere . plus it 's a local joint run by locals so it has that special flair to it .
1	ng amazing ! ! ! we had the sage chicken benedict and it was definitely more than enough for me and my wife . i also ordered a side of biscuit and gravy which was unbelievable but unecessary since we were not even close to finishing it since we were stuffed lol . the wait is kinda long but definitely worth the wait . hit up the bar inside while you wait . they have great hangover fixes .
1	i 'm from cali and am super picky about my food . i wish we had a gyro guys in la . i got the super gyro with extra meat and it tasted incredible . i 'm greek so i already went in with high expectations of what i thought the food should be like . very authentic ! the staff are friendly and most importantly it was a clean environment . i love supporting local businesses . i actually got to meet the gyro guys which i gotta say reminded me of my cousins back home. great food , great people , clean environment ! i 'll definitely be coming back .
1	it 's a little hard to find , but worth searching for . this was my first stop after arriving in phoenix for asca15 . i had the pork chop chorizo ( see photo ) .
1	the food is delicious and the portions are outrageous . our daughter lives in vegas and she knows good food and fine dining . this was so good the first night we went ... we went back the second night again . we had the ribeye steak , eggs benedict and chicken and waffles . all of it was deeelish ! ! can 't wait to go back again . oh .. and the service was excellent ! !
1	nom nom nom ... speak no more ! ! their a la carte menu is pretty great and amazing as well .
1	lobster bisque ! ! ! ! ! member that episode of seinfeld , when elaine is like : " we went to dinner , i ordered the lobster bisque , went back to his place yada yada yada yada , went home the next morning . " and jerry is like " you yada yada yada 'd right past the best part ! " and elaine says , " oh no i mentioned the bisque . " that is south side 's bisque ...... i 'm serious it is that friggin ' good ! i 've only been here a few other times and had their burger , salads & beer ( all delicious ) ... but nothing compares to their lobster bisque . * drool *
1	ohmygosh . absolute heaven . and this coming from a girl who likes her coffee as black as midnight in the north pole during the winter solstice ? yes , indeed . oh and the food 's good too. haha . i love everything chef tory makes . plus the home made chips are to die for .
1	a ) that means it 's awesome . b ) i need to get here earlier next time . starters we had fried mac n cheese with salsa and smoked sausage . it was the happy hour special . we also had the bacon wrapped jalapeños ( amazing ) . for my entree i had a half rack of ribs and more mac n cheese . ( see photos ) p.s. great beer selection .

1	total game changer . i 'm yet to have anything from this restaurant that isn 't great . everything is delicious ... but the smoked wings are a real " one of a kind " treat . the pulled pork requires an immediate " mmmmm " at first bite . the staff is fun , friendly , and helpful . these guys catered a work event and did an amazing job . the cuyahoga falls location is always super clean and family friendly . whom ever you decide to take here ... friends / family / date ... it is guaranteed to be a comfortably casual and delicious dining experience .
1	so . bomb . i 've never had poutine before . but i 've definitely had each of the ingredients separately . i got a regular serving of traditional poutine . it was extremely good . my co-worker had the cheesburger poutine and we 've already discussed going back next week . worth it !
1	i ventured into this place as a semi regular to las vegas and discovered soups . i highly recommend this spot . chris ( lil soup ) the owner / operator is not only a gr8 go-to person in vegas but makes a mean sandwich .. again .. get the combo !
1	try the fish burger , the sweet potato fries , it 's all simply delish !
1	... and for under $ 15 quick service . new york style ( sticking with the theme of the nyny hotel ) . i would go back to vegas just to eat here .
1	2 years later and it 's still excellent and i am still getting to the blackened grouper sandwich .
1	the burgers are soooooo delicious . writing this review is making me crave one ! love the loaded fries and the shakes as well .
1	this is top top top unpretentious cooking at its best .
1	the food is deeelish . i had the beef brisket and it was melt in your mouth great . staff is friendly and sandy is the best ! !
1	we live 60 miles away , but the drive is certainly worth it when a meal at 300 east awaits . we ordered the cod and filet----each was divinely cooked ! i recommend this restaurant to all my friends . my theatre group came here and were as impressed as i with the service , attention to detail , and certainly the delicious food .
1	i 've only eaten here once but i enjoyed it so much i plan to be back many times . the food is great , the atmosphere is phenomenal , and the staff is amazing . it 's a place that is worth trying . even if you don 't love it as i did , you will find the experience to be a good one . if you go , make sure you visit the bathroom for a good chuckle . how do you know which is the men 's and which is the women 's . ; - )
1	they have an amazing brunch on the weekends , with a great variety of sweet and savory selections . i honestly don 't think you can go wrong with any option on the menu . everything is fresh and flavorful , and the service is impeccable . one tip : i 'd definitely try the roasted joyce farms half chicken and the grilled gorgonzola-stuffed filet mignon .
1	$ 30 for lunch buffet , best buffet in town ~ ~ ~
1	because i can 't remember the guys names that helped us . yummy ! i had the burger . my guy had the steak sandwich . as soon as we walked in the door we were greeted . both of the guys behind the counter were super helpful . answered all of our questions . every thing was super clean ! ! ! my burger tasted like it was grilled in my own backyard . it was yummy and super juicy ! and when we left , they thanked us for coming by ! : )
1	but worth the trip , nice ipa selections , bells and lagunitas . broke my virginity on chicken and waffles and it was delicious , the mix of sweet and salty really hit the spot . save room for a cereal milkshake with vanilla vodka , you will not be disappointed ! staff was attentive and helpful . make it here
1	the blue kool-aid is the best and the sauce for the fried green tomatoes is amazing . the waffles weren 't what i expected and i loved them . not too sweet ! the fried chicken is spot on , delicious , fresh , home cooked food !
1	this restaurant serves up the most delicious and best waffles , eggs benedicts , house potatoes , and more . my blueberry basil mimosa was absolutely amazing ! love , love this restaurant .

1	you gotta come and get a coney and coney fries . indulge in some faygo and vernors . they grind their own beef .
1	training very well ! 4 / 20 / 17 not too busy tonight ! we still love this place ! maddy is working tonight she 's so sweet ! thank you it 's our go to spot especially when family comes to visit from new york ! no ones been disappointed ! thank you guys ! ! ! ! !
1	she was and is amazing ! yes , for a chain restaurant that i 'm sure most food is all brought in and heated up , i didn 't care . she was personable , fun , happy , excited , interactive , the list goes on . her passion for others around her was nothing short but amazing !
1	$ 31.95 for the saturday champagne / bloody mary brunch , and oh my god was it worth it. i drank that much in mimosas : ) prime rib , rack of lamb , king crab legs , made to order omelets , and one insane dessert station .... i 've never eaten so much in my entire life. i went back for fourths. it was a very very long meal and the fact that they kept bringing me alcohol didn 't spur me to go any faster. definitely a high point in my dining experiences in las vegas. if you have a chance to go , take it and drink your money 's worth but please dont forget the amazing food : )
1	i 've been everywhere including the strip and this is the place . if you are visiting , do yourself a favor and eat here .
1	having enjoyed zzeeks for a few years now , i thought i should update my review . zzeeks has a great variety on their menu . i recently tried the meatballs and i swear they are fantastic . i have to note that i do believe they have the very best service in all of ahwatukee . totally kid friendly . the delivery service is way above par . i ordered a salad for 12 people on christmas day and the owner actually delivered it on christmas . they also have yummy deserts ! this is a wonderful family friendly restaurant . the pizza is fantastic and the customer service is great . they make you feel like family .
1	inspirational quotes create a feel good experience all around . fresh food , incredibly reasonably priced , and healthy eating that is yummy . wish i lived here to come more often !
1	? i watched three people get seated before me and get their orders and food before me . four different people have come out on the patio and we still have not even been asked for our drinks ! we informed someone that we had not been served or even asked our order and then it took another 20 minutes . how can you not see someone sitting at a table with bright pink hair for 40 + minutes .
1	i work nearby and stop by a few times a week . it 's such a cute place . the decor is fabulous and the patio is delightful . such a great place to hang out with a glass of wine . the coffee is excellent and i 've never had any issues in the drive-thru . i 've tried a few of their limited / seasonal lattes and they 've all been great . the lunch menu is excellent- the salads and sandwiches are incredible . try the tuna and the omg . i 've never had any issues with long wait times . in fact , i 'm amazed at how quickly they get food out- the kitchen is miniscule .
1	32 years growing up in chicago. this place is heaven for me. the hot dogs , beef , and deep dish pie are beyond fabulous
1	excellent service - i appreciate it when my server checks table without being obtrusive . and , it 's a pepsi place ! : )
1	love santa fe rolls - next time i 'm asking for two each of the sauces because then i don 't have to worry about double-dipping accidentally at home . same for requesting an extra sauce with pot stickers when i 'm sharing a meal with someone : ) tonight the takeout food is as good as in restaurant & it 's a rare restaurant that can do that .
1	best burger in lv. we ordered the bacon blue burger . awesome garlic fries . they had a special . great service , food cooked to order , husband and wife mom and pop place , cant wait to go back there to try more from their menu. they also served free coffee with our meals .
1	yes , please . make that two . the place was packed , both customers and employees . but it was organized chaos . i was 13th in line and barely waited 5 minutes for my burgers . the fries looked good , and i 'll be back to try them and maybe a root beer or shake if they have those . great , fast service , and the burgers were great ! thin and crispy on the edges , but not overcooked . fresh onions . some type of sauce reminiscent of mcdonalds ' or big boy special sauce . no complaints , and i 've had a lot of good burgers lately .
1	their french toast is amazing ... sour dough bread dipped in egg and deep fried . the result is a firmer french toast ( not as soggy as the traditional style ) . it 's a must order even if you don 't care for french toast or sour dough . this place had successfully converted many of my friends , including myself .
1	$ 35 brunch , sunday before 12 line not too long beet salad eggs benedict bone marrow omelette station pork shoulder bacon all very good pass on vermicelli and mac and cheese great service $ 12 for bottomless mimosa
1	it 's worth it ! just check out all the unique ways your food and dishes are presented to you . also , consider the wait time , this buffet is almost no wait every time i went so far . i have been to this 3 times . my longest wait time was 5 minutes to get seated after payment . this is a must try buffet in vegas ! can you say , save some room for dessert ? look around before getting too much food on your plates !
1	this place is amazing. the ambiance is perfect , the food is delicious and the service is impressive. i went here for my birthday and had a delicious steak with lobster mashed potatoes and asparagus. to start , our table shared the bacon-wrapped shrimp and the caprese salad ( though the portions were pretty small ) . our server came out with a delicious warm chocolate lava cake and ice cream with a " happy birthday " written on it. its kind of expensive but it was a really good meal and i was impressed during my entire stay .
1	not so . i 've been there twice now and i 'll definitely keep coming back . best part : it 's closer to my house than sunny morning , which so far has been my favourite breakfast / brunch spot in mississauga . the space is kinda cool , with plenty of tables and a nice decor . service is super nice and quick . i tried the greek and spinach and feta omelettes , breakfast burrito and pete 's panini . everything was really tasty and not at all greasy . their home fries are yummy ! the portions are generous and the food is reasonably priced . i really hope that you can look past the 3.5 star and give it a try !
1	the service is so unique . i like to describe it as a " sonic from ww2 . " same pa speaker as when it was built . it 's a little hard to talk into but they 'll come out if it 's challenging 2 . get their cherry limeaid soda . my oh my is this good 3 . most important . get their sampler platter the bbq pork is wonderful and the bbq fried chicken is unbelievable . a combo could feed 2 people butttt who wants to share . i like their hush puppies too ! 4 . i can never photograph my food because we crush the food immediately . 5 . attached is a photo of the sign at least
1	we had the portobello frites which were quite tasty . the top shelf margarita pizza and cbr pizza were great choices . our glasses were never empty and christopher was knowledgeable . we are very pleased for coming .
1	mmmmmmmmm . living in nyc , how i missed you so ! legendary burgers , still reasonable prices and service was fairly quick considering the mob scene inside . love this place .
1	yes yes yes and their food , super awesome and tasty , everything is made from scratch ! ! ! mind blowing ! ! ! my favorite place now ! and manager and owner , superb ! service ... excellent ! !
1	for my birthday dinner , i chose pizzeria da enzo . 3rd year in a row . true story .
1	and if we 're going just to go , i guarantee half our conversation is about how amazing the burger is and how in the world do they make such a perfect burger ! ! i always get a cheeseburger animal style with well-done fries. try it , you wont regret it .
1	$ 3.75 .... steak and eggs ... can 't beat that from midnight -0600
1	my husband and i were married and hugo 's cellar opened . we have been visiting las vegas one or two times per year since then and every single time ... we go to hugo 's . we love , love , love it ! things we cannot live without ? lavosh , shrimp cocktail , salad , sherbet-in-the-middle , any entree , and the chocolate-covered strawberries , coffee with real whipped cream and chocolate chips . mmmmmm ..... at 55 years old , we are totally stuck in our habits and love hugo 's . you should go and start a tradition of your own . : )
1	casellas is one of the best lunch spots in town . family owned and operated , always friendly and the food is consistently delicious . the pastrami sandwich and the cheesesteak are both excellent but don 't forget to try the potato salad and their home made cannoli !
1	got the chicken fried steak and though it ' not texas large , it 's a decent size and good gravy . better than some chicken fried steaks i 've paid a lot more for . eggs were cooked right , potatoes crisp outside and soft inside ... ... basically comfort " normalicious " food ( stealing that from yelper angela h 's vocabulary ) . yes , it 's not the best breakfast i had- but it 's solid and a much better alternative to a shitty night at a denny 's . it starts at 12am so stop by for your after drinking breakfast noms . beats a lot of the graveyard specials in taste and price .
1	was excellent and worth the drive to arizona charlie 's . fun adventure !
1	need i say more ? ? ok i will ... the diner was such a cool , laid-back , art-filled environment to enjoy a simple , yet satisfying meal at . this will be on the list next time i 'm in ohio city .
1	the guy making food was really nice , and the place seemed like a pretty busy ( though small ) burger joint . no complaints about the burger ( nothing amazing , but not at all bad ) or the buns ( unique but pretty good ) . a nice quick place to refuel .
1	the food is delicious and extremely affordable . the staff is accommodating and the waitress is lively ! i recommend the eggs benedict , i substitute peameal for tomatoe slices .
1	we did not know what to expect except this was a french restaurant i want to say that this is the best restaurant we have eaten in in charlotte . we went to paris last year and celebrated our 20th anniversary at a wonderful restaurant and even though we did not have a nine course meal here , the food was just as good our server stacy was very professional and patient with all our request . not ever do 6 of us go out and have everyone totally pleased .
1	amazing . place is so good . service is not great but i continue to go back . grab a bottle of wine on the way in at the adjacent wine shop as its byob
1	better than the meal we had for dinner at maison boulard for 4times the cost . amazing .
1	great place to end the day with very reasonable prices and amazing service ! we will be back !
1	what a great happy hour and fun atmosphere to hang out . we had the cheesy bread , pretzel bits and boneless wings . pretzel bits were probably the best , however all food was pretty good . our waitress ( antonia ) was very attentive and extremely quick . constantly coming around and asking if we needed anything . if you wanted to watch a sporting events there 's probably over 30 tv 's ! great place for watching games . first time here and won 't be my last !
1	3 fingers combo with texas toast- hot off the fryer and tasted great sandwich with fries- fresh and tasted great sweet tea- great crew- efficient and friendly
1	so nice outside on the patio .. everything was great ...
1	the sweet potato fries are almost too expensive but we 've never regretted ordering them . they have a couple vegan options too .
1	there was enough food for 6 . holy smokes .... the bbq was fantastic . now we all have lunch for tomorrow .
1	burger , burger with cheese and double burger . the prices are very reasonable and the food is as good as any fast food .
1	both times i had the gyros with fries , and the gyros is amazing ! never had one before , so this place has set the bar high . the lamb was very seasoned and cut in thin strips , and the fries were cut thick , almost like wedges . service was very accommodating ( they remembered my order ) and clued me in on just how to pronounce gyros ( yee-ros ) . truly a hidden gem , but i get the feeling they have a loyal customer base . if you go , make sure to order extra sauce for your gyros !
1	i live right next to this place , so i have been coming in occasionally and have been consistently impressed by the service and the food . the staff are usually friendly , quirky , and fun individuals . food always comes out hot and fast . sandwiches and burgers are good , onion rings are great , fries are pretty good too . i 'm not a soda person , but if i were , they have a massive collection of craft sodas and root beer . definitely recommend this place !
1	just pulled a ruby out of hickory . the yocals seem to be repeat customers , i dig the small joint feeling . i paid my tab , which means i would like to return !
1	lighting is subdued . this place just says : " worth it for whatever you spend ! " service was by pros , not your run of the mill wait staff . the beef tenderloin was excellent , the chicken was tender : everything reeked of quality . you cannot go wrong here . desserts knocked it out of the pnc park ! we cannot wait to go back in the spring to visit our pitt kid . this will be first choice for dinner . gorgeous restaurant .
1	i had a perfect steak , my husband had the pork chops and our sides were great .
1	we left very satisfied , and every single dish was delicious . my favorites were the carrots , broccoli , and rutabagas - creatively prepared and hearty enough to be meals in their own right . their standing butterscotch pudding is worth it - get it even if you 're full . we also ordered their cheapest arizona red wine , and it was great ! the owner was warm and welcoming , and all of the servers were really friendly and helpful . there was no snootiness here , but real enthusiasm for great food and people who come to enjoy it .
1	2 of us had the almond crusted french toast ala carte . it was fantastic and the portion was huge . the almonds are ground fine , so your not crunching the nuts , and there is a slight hint of cinnamon . it was the best french toast we ever had . the other person had the cinnamon roll french toast combo which came with 2 eggs and sausage links . he loved it as well . service was great . the place is very nice , lots of great things on the menu . can 't wait to go back and try something else . i wish you had a location in the nw .
1	the waitress was very familiar with the menu and ingredients , alternate meal arrangements and substitutes to accommodate . she gave multiple options for everyone and was very thorough . the food did take a while to be served up to about 45 minutes or so but we were in no hurry and enjoy conversation , ambiance and drinks while waiting . the food was good and follow up / attentiveness of our server was fantastic . we enjoyed ourselves and will definitely return .
1	hush puppies were great ! worth the drive , we 'll be back for the jumbo shrimp taco .
1	i would try to find something to nit-pick , but this is simply astounding value for $ 19.95 . the seared flank steak , thinly sliced at the carving station , was phenomenal - - an ideal cut of meat . unexpected favorites included the creamy herbed polenta , the super-tasty pesto mashed potatoes . the rotini with a bolognese sauce had classic bolognese flavor - - not just another meat sauce . the raw tuna nicoise sald was great . incredible dessert selection . tasteful furnishings ( sat at the nicely marbled bar - - a nice option with the constant drink refills a glance away - - and you might get seated quicker if you volunteer to sit there ! ) .
1	i 'm new to the area and am delighted that this gem is in my neighborhood
1	plenty of breakfast and lunch options . indoor and outdoor , which are options i always love having . salads and soups here have all been superb !
1	and the food , especially the veggie burger , is awesome . we 'll be eating there more often . love the beer flights too .
1	we had the falafel plate and gyros plate which were delicious . the mvp fries and the tsatsiki are fantastic . got a free dessert : )
1	the flavors are ridiculously good . it always surprises me how creative they are . plus the naan , is delicious as well . definitely going back and of course trying something new .
1	food is always good and so is the service . unique atmosphere that is fresh and inviting .
1	, , , , dirty martini is a must w cheese olive . i recommend steak tartare , mix greens , and cream spinach . very delicious . for a party of 3 - porterhouse steak for 2 , salad , appetizer , 3 cocktails , cream of spinach - approx $ 200
1	the food is homemade and fresh . the fried chicken is very good , which i had on my first 2 visits . on the visit i got the west side burger and onion rings . one of the best burgers i 've ever had and the rings are great , no frozen deep fried rings here ! they are fresh and crisp . i 'll be back .
1	great visit to the bullpen ! ! ! the server kelly did an amazing job tonight staying on top of our orders - presently surprised ! the cheese curds , quesadilla , chicken wrap--all highly recommended by our table !
1	the best reason to visit pittsburgh . we had blueberry , banana walnut , and banana chocolate chip hotcakes . each was excellent , but love the banana chocolate chip . service was efficient , but not rushed .
1	3rd times the charm , great food 3rd 1st friday in a row great creative food every time !
1	could potentially relocate just to eat here . a vegetarian 's dream . perfect menu . and all the diners are uber-fit ( well , perhaps , except for me : )
1	this place rocks . on last visit , i started with the radishes - who knew they 'd be so good ? i went with the wings and foie gras clams as my dinner and egg frites as a side . i can 't describe exactly how delectable and satisfying it all was and how everything just went so well together . the black label in cans for $ 2 was the topper . the entire place was packed , lively yet our table of 10 was served promptly and courteously . every person in our group raved about their experience . each time i am on the north coast , greenhouse is on my list of ' must do 's ' .
1	gumbo is out standing . shrimp boil is a must . wish they had some sweet tea ! !
1	its that good . great food , personal service , and reasonable prices , can 't expect more . special s are just that . don 't miss the soups , they 're better than seinfeld 's soup nazi
1	got a visit to the back operations . always willingly sharing samples before you buy . personal favorite smoked butterfish and portuguese sausage . always have new items today we tried smoked sturgeon & ahi . also 3 varieties of beef tougne sausage .
1	here 's a tip for patrons , sit at the bar , if u see open seats . much faster service and brian is great at multitasking . wife had the fish special and i had the green chili cheese burger . both meals were quite tasty , no complaints at all . another gentleman would from time to time come back to give brian a hand when drink orders were flying in . both guys had a great attitude and seemed to enjoy being there . place has always been packed when we have come . that means something must be going right . will visit again at next opportunity .
1	great experience as always . horses and the falcon are absolutely wonderful , staff is super friendly and they all stay in character throughout the whole show . food is nice , portions are huge ( i am yet to ever finish the whole thing ) great place for the whole family , or a group of friends . totally worth it to upgrade to royalty package and arrive early . : )
1	service is really friendly an fast . today i had egg benedict it was wonderful .
1	half price appetizers . the food is excellent . maybe we got lucky but the burger was excellent , as were the buffalo wings and the spinach dip . i didn 't find it that overpriced for the quality ( and quantity ) . hot waiters .
1	bacon is served here ( the good stuff ) . 2 . exceptional service ... even when there 's a bit of a wait . 3 . the bella-bella benedict with prosciutto , arugula , and balsamic glaze is downright awesome . it can also be ordered with a side of bacon . : )
1	yes . food is always excellent , staff is always nice- what more could you want ?
1	i tried the same thing with mcdonald 's eggs and they tasted like some kind of fake egg filler substance . j in the b eggs taste like teal scrambled eggs . tell them to put it all in the same container so your eggs pick up the yummy sausage taste too . ever since i 've been running 2 miles every morning , skipping breakfast is not an option . i 'm hungry ! this is good , cheap and filling .
1	food is amazing ! ! ! ! the calimari is so yummy but the portions are small of it for the price , the dinner bread is mouth watering , lightly salted and garliced and melty butter . mmmm ! the soups are omg ! ! ! thick , creamy , ingredient filled . now for the main courses make sure you read the menu , i messed up and what i got wasn 't what i was expecting , but they will make it right . most definitely will be back : - )
1	we had breakfast here and decided on the build your own omelette.it was perfectly done with the sliced avocado placed decoratively on top and the hash browns had melted cheese .add to it a generous helping of toast and it all looked and tasted awesome . the price was not cheap but normal for this type of place and this type of food.i highly recommend this place !
1	i had my usual corned hash beef with buttermilk pancake . delish ! !
1	hreat deal ... love the spinach artichoke dip ... and flat breads esp the margarita flatbreads ! ! ! sirena our usual waitress is the best ! ! ! ask for her ! ! !
1	i 'm not kidding , i would smuggle their biscuits out by the dozen if i could ! ! wish it wasn 't 90 minutes away . loved eating there . it 's a typical diner atmosphere but the food is stellar ! !
1	i have always loved this place . the atmosphere is great ! my fiance and i always get the oysters and alligator . it is a bit pricey , but well worth it . we go every chance we get . service is always on point ! love love love !
1	i always get that , plus the italian . my two usuals from earl 's . i 'm definitely a veteran and long-time fan of this convenient location because let 's be real , can 't be fine dining for every meal in vegas now . i love that this place is open 24 / 7 and the consistency of the sandwiches is always up to par .
1	liver and onions . great breakfast . good service . tasty food . third best liver and onions in the city . best liver and onions on the westside .
1	their breakfast is killer ! my friend and i came back from red rock ready to eat a horse . fortunately when we got there , they sat us quickly and our food came almost as soon as we ordered ! i love this place . the food is stellar and the service is out of this world . just talking about it makes me hungry .
1	just do it . you won 't be sorry ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! there was truly a party in my mouth after eating them . couldn 't stop thinking about how amazing they tasted . such a cool , fun & funky vibe in this tiny ( too tiny ) 2nd floor spot . just order 4 or 5 things & split them all . or not since they 're tapas . their wknd brunch is awesome too . i had a breakfast panini , which was absolutely amazing ... berries & cream cheese ... who doesn 't love that all melty & gooey goodness ?
1	i could eat like 5 plates of this ... soooooo delicious !
1	can you say food coma . saw this place while driving down black canyon freeway and i realized why it sounded so familiar . i saw it from an article i had screenshotted naming the 100 best restaurants in the country . so of course bf and i had to go . we decided on the whole hog heaven . 2 types of ribs , 2 types of meat , and 3 sides to share between us . sooooo good . meat was tender , flavor was delicious , and it came so quickly . shoutout to our server jason for being so friendly and attentive . oh , and they give u free mini donuts in the end . sold . lol .
1	fries , well done , animal style . some employees don 't know their own menu , these kids know the " secret " one no problem .
1	love the sunday night special price for the fixed menu choices . great place for special meals with out of town visitors .
1	now , i do love the smoked meat , but for me , to have it on the poutine is almost enough . the french onion soup is my god good . the sandwiches , well , they just make them amazing . this is another place that is a staple stop on my yearly trip up to montreal , almost wish they weren 't so far away and i could have them every day .
1	the consistency after all these years is hard to find in resturants but they are still top notch . nick the cook is always awesome and has been there since i started going.thank you : )
1	the sirloin chili nachos are the amazing . i 've found out that you can order them in half sizes too . i always get the donnie 's blackened wings and my husband always gets the killer bees . the thai pb & j are amazing too . the service is always impeccable no matter how busy it is . easily the best wings in the city .
1	i 'm a creature of habit and somehow always order the same thing , but it 's fabulous , so why not ... ? ! ? my boyfriend and i were smart this year and got there super early in the morning - no line - score ! ! ! our waiter checked on us just enough and didn 't hover over us or annoy us at all . all in all , a great experience , as usual . we 'll be back every single time we 're in vegas !
1	the chicken and lamb were ok . the service was really good .
1	salmon wellington , lobsters , pea pasta ( ? ) and tons of good quality food for buffet . one of the best restaurants i have been in toronto . will definitely come again , possibly during the summer , for croissants , macarons and the patio !
1	expect to wait on the weekends . the much hyped raspberry french toast was incredible ! pumpkin pancakes also noteworthy . great prices and service .
1	once again our food / service was awesome , ambience great and drinks were too good ! * try the dream berry martini if you like strawberries . * try the mambo salad . it is a cesar salad with horseradish in the dressing so it has a spicy kick . have them serve it with shrimp for something really delicious . * lobster mash is good and sinful . don 't let it get cold
1	the food here is always hot not warm , and if something is wrong with your order , just talk to the manager who takes care of the problem ( only happened once to me ) . all the employees smile , gives you their name , asks if they can get you anything else , even offer to take your garbage to throw away for you . they show appreciation for your business . i live closer to another different one that i refuse to go to as the manager has turned grumpy , to bad i will just go to 40th street for my meals .
1	one of my favorite restaurants in las vegas ( and nyc ) . delicious , innovative dishes made all the better by friendly , attentive service , a fun , relaxed ambience , and the bonus of being able to watch the fascinatingly painstaking food prep process . highlights include the decadent braised pork belly and pommes purée , and the refreshingly light les légumes ( mediterranean vegetables layered with buffalo mozzarella ) . the only disappointment for us was the dessert course---a tart assortment which didn 't live up to the perfection that preceded it . can 't wait till my next visit !
1	the view is spectacular as expected . the service is outstanding ( dan ) . the food is excellent , osso buco , gnocchi and tortellaci . the owner / manager very solicitous . the prices much more reasonable than many neighboring establishments . the only drawback is out off their control- a $ 10 parking lot across grandview ave .
1	ellen is my favorite waitress . i usually get beef tips and pancakes yum ! recently i tried something new strawberry crepes ! yum ! my new favorite ! all the food is good ! only thing i 've found i don 't like is the strawberry splash drink . maybe more of a kid drink . the restaurant is always clean . usually a short wait time . balloon guy is a fun bonus . kids love the balloon master peices . my father-in-law has to use a walker . i 'm impressed that your staff always goes out of their way to seat him in a booth close to the door . your staff rocks ! see you next saturday !
1	we had two different employees come by to see how everything was tasting . one came back and cleared our table for us . don 't mean to compare you to another restaurant but you got cane 's beat . it 's all about the sauce selection for me . although i do like cane 's i don 't like their sauce . only other option is ketchup . you guys rock with all the sauce selection . i also like that i can get grilled chicken for a healthier meal . love love love the lemonade . prices are affordable . very clean restaurant with happy employees .
1	place doesn 't look like much from the outside , but trust me . it 's a hidden gem . from full blown burgers to deep fried oreos . this place will hit all your late night munchie needs . tony marc 's is my new spot !
1	they were crazy busy , and he took the time to hook a brotha up . katie rung me up , and asked me about my weekend . they both made for a great experience . the third employee was visibly busy , and doing her job . killer stuff guys
1	split it with a friend although we both agreed that of we go back we might each get one of our own . had it with the white truffle butter , which was a good touch , but not necessary . the truffle fries are above average ; as a note i 'm usually not wild about truffle fries as they 're somewhat over played and underwhelming . service was good too , cocktails were all well made and garnished . the wine options offer good variety .
1	we had an amazing meal there on valentines day . -dates with goats cheese and pesto : amazing ! ! -beef carpaccio : wonderful dish , however this is quite large for a starter and could easily be shared -duck confit : wow ! the duck was cooked to perfection , so juicy and delicious . the wine menu was extensive and the waitress was helpful with the wine selection we will definitely be back for more !
1	she was one of the most attentive servers i have had in a long time . the food was great and we were eating within 10 minutes of ordering .
1	absolutely amazing . we had a hard time getting reservations but it was worth the wait . i highly recommend the wood-fire mushrooms , squash ravioli and iron steak ! the service is top-notch . cute place - great option for date night !
1	best pancakes i 've ever had . service was great and the wait was nonexistent when we went . wasn 't a huge fan of the turkey sausage , but my dining partner said the normal sausage was fantastic . i had the banana chocolate and it was amazing ! will always be a pittsburgh favorite .
1	the service was good and the food was very fresh . it doesn 't seem like you can go wrong with anything on the menu . definitely a great place to grab a bite and chat with your girlfriends or an afternoon date spot with your significant other . 1 ) signature strawberry chicken salad ( with grilled chicken , vine-ripened strawberries , mixed baby greens , toasted almonds and poppyseed vinaigrette ) 2 ) mediterranean melt ( with roasted seasonal vegetables , smoked mozzarella cheese and basil pesto on warm ciabatta ) with a side of potato salad . the service was decent , the food was amazing . i wouldn 't mind going back again !
1	friendly staff and great sandwiches . you can call ahead and order , order on the cap ap , or order online . great location , clean restaurant , and wise chips : )
1	this incredible restaurant is a 5 minute walk from the hilton monona terrace hotel , where we are staying . loading up before the 70.3 triathlon on sunday . place was packed at 10 : 30 am . devoured the large broccoli & feta & walnut pesto omelette . with the crispy potatoes i was in heaven . so fresh , so reasonably priced . the cookies are tempting me right now ... maybe after the race ! !
1	great servers ... very nice decor and soundtrack ... and great food ! warm . friendly . i 'm a single late 50s guy that loves a good caesar and i walk past a bunch of places to go here once every couple weeks .
1	while an la carte menu is an option , pricing encourages you to order the seasonal or tasting menu . a foodie friend of my always said , you can gage the quality of the food to come by the bread in the basket . when the perfect baguette and multi grain arrived i knew i was in for some thing special . my tasting menu included , lobster bisque , frois gras brûlée , shrimp and scallop and finally the dick breast . i finished with the creme brûlée and a trio of cakes . coffe and tea were also included . everything was wonderful , if i had one complaint a little salt was needed for nearly every dish to make it shine .
1	fries are sold separately and are about $ 4 , the atmosphere is good music is a bit loud . playing mostly classic rock 5 guys channels the burger joints of the 70s and it works ! ! !
1	i might be over rating but this area ( cornelius , north east huntersville ) is under served by this type of bbq restaurant . i thought the wings are awesome , smoked and fried . $ 9.99 for a bbq plate and two sides was reasonable . the bbq was good and for sides the onion rings are good homemade and thick . i thought the slaw was average . kids had bbq plate and hot dog plate $ 6.00 with one side and a drink was reasonable .
1	and boy did they deliver ! i chose the regular burger with bacon and fries . i don 't think i will have to eat for another week ! ! the burger was cooked to perfection , pair that with the fresh lettuce , tomato , 3 sauces , cheese and the bacon and it was heaven ! i could only manage to get through 3 quarters of the burger and fries , before my stomach said no more , even though i wanted to keep going it was that good ! only taking marks off due to slow service , but they can be forgiven as it was at capacity with minimal waiting staff .
1	) finally thought i 'd give it a chance cuz i was lazy but really wanted fish and chips and i 'm glad i did ! they have so many varieties of fish , it 's awesome . i had the rainbow trout which could be cooked grilled or battered and fried . the batter was light and not oveepowering ; it 's always tough to get that right in fish and chips ! i added the coleslaw which was delicious and should probably be included because it goes so well . i plan to try at least 2 more types of fish before i move out of the neighborhood soon !
1	food was very good ( regular naan , lahori 's dahi balah , tarka daal ) , and of decent portion size , prices are very reasonable . service was very friendly , although it did seem a little slow even when there were not many customers . they were " in the back , " so i cannot be sure if they were attending to other restaurant business , but it did appear that way . i 'll be happy to return .
1	: ) this is my second favorite buffet in vegas ( after wicked spoon ) . again , the quality of the food you get here is totally worth the price ! i especially love the sweet pea risotto and the crepe station : ) yum . one trick is to come here during lunch and stay until dinner ! that way , you get to try both lunch and dinner menu , but only paying the lunch price ! however , you 'll probably be wasting a lot of your time in vegas here , but hey , it 's worth it !
1	every employee we talked to was super helpful and pleasant . took the staff elevator due to heavy conference intake . staff service just exceeded all expectations and everything was enjoyable . no issues and great location .
1	everything was so well balanced , a little touch of acidity , a tiny bit of sweetness , something with a bit of crunch for texture . you could just tell there was a lot of thought put into the inception of each dish . the bison tenderloin carpaccio was exceptional . the candy bar dessert with coffee icecream was phenomenal . i will definitely be eating here again !
1	love the belgian-cut style fries , the japanese mayo , nori and sesame seeds on top . i would add scallions , pepper , and ketchup on the side as well to make it taste even better . overall , great place to get fries and poutine that stands out from other fries stands .
1	i will preface this by saying we 've only been for brunch but we are regulars . it 's a great neighborhood restaurant with some of the best brunch around . the restaurant itself is quite small but they have a great patio when the weathers nice . most weekends you will find a 30-45 minute wait for brunch . food-wise , best biscuits in town ! add some of their apple butter and you 'll leave happy . they also do great omelets and a wonderful cinnamon vanilla pancake .
1	otherwise , i have not found corned beef hash or hotcakes as good as what pamela 's serves here . the strawberry hotcakes are filled with strawberries , brown sugar , and cream , and the crispy hotcake with an occasional brown sugar crunch is always more than satisfying . then there 's the corned beef hash that i dream of whenever i taste other kinds of hashes elsewhere . it looks simple and homely , but somehow it tastes heavenly . i always come here whenever i 'm in town !
1	my awesome friend took me here and we ordered some scrumptious desserts ! french white chocolate bread pudding 4 / 5 white chocolate raspberry cheesecake 5 / 5 the ambiance is nice and if you order one of their whiskey drinks in comes in a fancy glass that rolls around in a circle . the bartender educated us and said its to add to the flavor . awesome place ! ; )
1	meatballs on main is the new sunday post-church tradition for my family . look forward to it each weekend !
1	it 's actually much more casual than the reputation implies , and the food , while very good , isn 't fine dining per se ... but that 's great , and the price point actually fits well with it . had the curried squash soup with coriander , which was quite good . also had the fennel pierogies , which were amazing . the garnishes and sauces came together really well . only bad thing was i was too full to order dessert ! all the staff were extremely friendly - attentive enough for this type of restaurant , but not constantly checking in ; great for meeting friends or colleagues for dinner , but probably not a great ambience / setting for an intimate meal .
1	i really enjoyed their rainbow potatoes with the breakfast panini as well as their chilaquiles . coffee is pretty average .
1	just about the right amount price : 3.0 / 5.0 - each brunch entree averaging to 20 cad plus tax & tip.not the best pricing yet not too outrageous service : 5.0 / 5.0 - prompt , attentive waiter we got : smoked salmon benedict - taste grade : a ratatouille - taste grade : a funghi pizza - taste grade : a- ( portion is a little small , not enough mushrooms but still solid flavor overall )
1	excellent restaurant . had a great meal at tarbell 's . ambiance and service were very nice . food was truly wonderful . we had the famous spaghetti ( trust me-its a main course ) and the special ravioli . both were very tasty , cooked to perfection and the ingredients and spices just exploded on the palate . also , prior to that had the beefsteak / ' tomato salad , and the house salad . all greens , fresh , crispy and tasty . nice wine list . split the bourbon chocolate bread pudding to finish the evening . highly recommended for fine dining in phoenix .
1	finally tried this place after a few months and was not disappointed . food absolutely gets 5 stars . service was a bit spotty and disorganized , but whatever . got the boneless wings ( real chicken , not processed meat ) and pulled pork and fries . for a non bbq place , the pulled pork was actually quite good . fresh cut fries , everything was great . ended up getting the cookie dough cheesecake for dessert , sadly not that great . quite dry and the ice cream wasn 't that great either . kitchen is open till 1 , and tuesdays has $ 2 beers past 6pm with a great selection on tap ! check this place out !
1	the food was tasty with a lot of flavour . i enjoyed the deconstructed strawberry shortcake dessert . their mixed berry juice was amazing but would have been perfect with some alcohol : ) . service was incredibly great compared to other high end restaurants i 've been to . i would love to come try their regular menu . only thing i disliked was the dark lighting in the inside of the restaurant .
1	would recommend trying this place out ! just shy of 5 stars only because our server could have been a little more attentive but was prompt overall . portions are healthy sized .
1	very nicely designed space . great menu . excellent service . good pricing . an excellent weekend brunch choice . ( bottomless mimosas ! ) meats on the mto plate might have been browned a bit more for better color and texture but were nevertheless good . great breakfast wraps as well ( which can , alternatively , be omelets instead ) . fresh juice choices as well as coffee and espresso . very impressed .
1	the burgers are extremely juicy and flavourful , with a wide variety of different types of burgers available to choose from . their milkshakes are fantastic if you 're into shakes , and their fries are spiced up quite nicely and actually taste good . the prices are pretty standard for a premium burger ( around $ 15 for a meal ) and its worth every dollar . the service is fast and the seating is usually plentiful . the interior is clean and welcoming . overall a great experience .
1	we got the mahi sandwich and grilled chicken sandwich which both came with fries . they weren 't anything to die for but $ 4.99 for a sandwich while you are seated at a fancy outdoor patio in miracle mall ? do it !
1	yum ! i am all over this place like nobody 's business . i love me a great gyro . but to get it at a great price with a clean restaurant and really nice people behind the counter . i 'm all for it . : ) great job gyro 's house !
1	im a family of four with two kids so finding a place that gives my kids something to eat for cheap is great ! you have many options to choose from . a good place for breakfast , lunch and dinner dates with the hubby . cheap wines and more.i wish i had one closer
1	excellent spot to stumble into and unwind / recover before cabbing it back to your hotel : ) you will leave full , happy , and spending less than you did on tips alone for drinks at that snazzy club you just came from . so kids , to review : $ 4.99 steak and eggs in the wee hours of the morning . cooked to order . so good . that 's whassup . also recommend the onion rings . yeah , we threw that in as a drunken impulse decision . the best we ever made in vegas ; )
1	comes with 2 slices of buttered toast and hash browns . service was great and fast which is excellent when it 's 3 in the morning and you kind of just want to creep off to bed before the food coma hits you too hard . my steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare , and was much more tender than the steak over at ellis island . no sawing necessary . park to the rear of the casino building for quick and easy access .
1	so worth it . this is a very hidden gem , located off highway 73 . well worth the trip . this pizza is reminiscent of my days back in nyc . just terrific pizza .
1	4 adults and 3 children dined in on a thursday night - food was great and so was service - loved the owner - he was so nice and accommodating - will def be returning here
1	they don 't make em like this anymore . the only thing better than the food and drinks is the service . this place is for the best of the best times
1	and $ 4 bud drafts too . tons of food , so do your health a favor and split a meal with someone else . cooper donates a lot back to our community . a friend of mine from college received a scholarship to grand canyon university funded by alice cooper . support local ! : )
1	love the live music in the jester room side of this place ! . volleyball outside ; huge patio with tv 's : huge spots bar ..... affordable food and beverage and they serve late every night of the week .
1	every time as good as the last . pizza , meatballs , hummus , and greek salad sandwich all so good . our new favorite friday feast
1	i 'm a super fan . i love coming to south point just to go to steak ' n shake right before hitting vegas . the service is okay , but you get your food fast . the atmosphere is like ruby 's diner and in n out put together , haha . try the $ 4 burgers and the shakes ! it 's definitely a steal !
1	service , food , prices , ambiance , and overall restaurant experience was fantastic ! ! ! would definately be back ! ! !
1	3 had burgers , 1 fish and chips . all of us were satisfied . i was impressed with my special requests ( burger as a wrap instead of a bun-- turned out great . ) i would definitely go back here .
1	only $ 3.95 here . now that 's a great deal in vegas ! ! ! you get what you pay for in portion and price but definitely a good drive to make off the strip . expect the same service you get at any ihop or denny 's .
1	4 keggs is a good bar i love the food i love the staff inside are so nice the food is awesome
1	for appetizers we had our complimentary bread with our meal that had a sweet butter to go with it and some jalapeño pretzel bites which were also very delicious . i also had their clam chowder and a sandwhich with portabello mushrooms on it . this was my first trip to this restaurant and will not be my last ! i haven 't been this pleased with a new food spot in a long time !
1	i drive out of my way to go here at least once a week but i have been there 4 times in one week ! delicious every time . service would put any establishment to shame ! there is no hit or miss here it 's always square on !
1	ordered the brisket , ribs , 6 rolls , 2 mac n cheese and a mashed potato casserole . preordered it for pick up . it was hot , fresh and ready just as we showed up to pick it up . the food was absolutely delicious ! so happy i got to finally try this place out as i was eyeing it for a while now . $ 40 bucks and it fed 5 people plus a little left over . will definitely come back and recommend !
1	we enjoyed dining on the patio . great service and food ! try the sweet potato tots- so yummy ! everything we had was fresh and delicious . wish we had a lazy dog in reno - hint hint .
1	you could tell by the atmosphere that it was going to be good and it was . our first time there and we all had something different . oscar our server was great , will definitely go back again .
1	one couple had the chicken & waffles , and we had the fried chicken . everything was perfectly prepared , without any typical greasy fried chicken heaviness . if it 's possible that chicken , waffles , mac & cheese and cornbread could be tremendously tasty and yet healthy , yardbird seems to have found the secret . in any event , it was one of the best meals in a long time . considering that most entrees are large and should be shared , prices are reasonable . and finally , service was very prompt and professional .
1	the 4 of us all ordered something different and were very pleased and look forward to going back real soon . fred the owner is very friendly and excited about his restaurant and sharing his appreciation and passion for different flavors !
1	i know because we all sampled one another dish ! i ordered the hot italian sub and the wife got the pork sliders ! both were amazing ! boy ordered chicken alfredo with broccoli and garlic bread and mom got the veggie wrap ! highly recommend this little neighborhood joint to others ! clean and attentive ! it 's a sun devils and corn huskers joint so that 's nice come football season for my asu games ! go and you won 't be disappointed !
1	excellent meal and unpretentious atmosphere . highly recommended it . a short walk from paris , flamingo , or many others .
1	great selection for breakfast , lunch & dinner . my western sandwich was huge ( 4 eggs ) and came with home fries for 5.99 . my kids ordered the breakfast skillets . lots of food , had to take some home . i for see this little restaurant becoming a local fave ! reasonable pricing .
1	i originally loved them because of the wings ... try the garlic parmesan . i 'm glad to see an " older " pittsburgh restaurant become so popular . i like the chips and the rachel sandwich is great .
1	he was very knowledgeable , patient and personable . he made our first time at del frisco 's one to remember ! the food was good - my husband and i had the filet mignon , salmon , oysters , crab cakes , onion rings , mashed potatoes , butter cake and cheesecake . the oysters were my favorite and the cheesecake was his .
1	you can reach 2 if you sit on the patio . a lot of action around here ..... oh , and try the the bernie omlette . capers and salmon scrambled eggs .
1	i ordered fried calamari , lobster soup and a grilled salmon with mushrooms and bok choy in the side . everything was very delicious . i recommend the lobster soup for those who like strong flavor ( wine ) , there are some small pieces of lobsters inside , it 's better eat with the bread they serve as courtesy . the server was very kind and attentive , i really like the service . the window view was wonderful and the price is fair for the quality of the food .
1	great breakfast , it came swiftly . i had corned beef hash , she had eggs benedict . very good . raul was our server and he was great . customer service has led us to walk out before ordering at other places . not here . raul was top notch . would come back again .
1	4 stars for being as good as the one in houston , tx and an additional star for no wait , scoreeeee ! !
1	she is awesome , she hustles and makes sure we have everything we need . we had the mexican omelet and french toast with a side of bacon . when you check in on yelp you also get a free banana nut muffin . food had a lot of flavor and came hot and fast . definitely a place to come back to .
1	good but i didnt wow me . 5 stars for the honey glazed salmon . best salmon i had so far . it was cooked perfectly ! ! ! !
1	chicken strips were absolutely delicious , not overbreaded and not greasy . great , great , great for the lunch the day after partaking in the consumption of high octane beverages !
1	10 dogs down . all amazing ! ! had the waffle today , oh my goodness was it delicious . diana ( owner ) and melanie ( daughter ) are always wonderful . sofia ( daughter ) hooks it up with the best waffles ive ever had .
1	i try something new each time . this visit was the fish and chips . great ! large serving very tender . previous visits , i have had the burgers and steaks . all good . best of all they long poor on the drinks . you get your money 's worth .
1	adobo . fried . rice . omelet . a legendary dish . for those who don 't know adobo , it 's a filipino dish that 's main ingredients are soy sauce , vinegar , and onions , complimented by chicken or pork . not spicy , but really flavorful . they have other hawaiian dishes like loco moco , mac salad , kalbi , etc . , too . bring your appetite . this thing is about the size of a chipotle burrito . it is soooo delicious a friend came along after breakfast at the bellagio buffet and still managed to finish it .
1	i love this place. i try to make a trip here at least every other week on my lunch breaks . i usually go to the " to go " side of the restaurant just because i 'm grabbing a quick lunch during work. i have always had fantastic , fast , friendly service. i strongly recommend you going here for a lunch or even a romantic evening out . always a winner !
1	this place is amazing . food is delicious and i 've never had a bad experience . be warned that weekend mornings you might wait up to 30-40 mins but once in the food is fast and amazing ! definitely worth the wait .
1	you won 't be sorry . and all their beer is delicious ! !
1	whether you get them spicy or regular , get the atl wings . trust me
1	4 words. rib eye medium rare. and cinammon butter rolls. hands down , the best steakhouse. better than outback , ruth chris 's , all the fancy places .
1	chicago style deep dish . this is as close as it gets in this town and you 've gotta give them 5 stars for that alone . i 've never understood why nobody does it right out here . its not the water no matter what they say . they don 't have sausage patty but the crust is great and the za is super tasty . if you 're done with the artisan style or you just need a good old fashioned " comfort food meal " than go with the chicago style . it 'll do the trick .
1	what a nice way to end the work day . sports on the tv for the guys . features a full bar and the menu is unique . they also have a secret menu . ask for the arizona menu . i like the grilled cheese from the az menu . everyone is really nice and there is no pressure to hurry up eat and get out . they also have a nice patio that also is accommodating to the bartender for perfect weather like tonight . beautiful water fountains outside too make it more enjoyable . probably will come back when possible .
1	i got everything i wanted : american , breakfast , asian , indian , and sweets . there was even more than this , but my stomach just couldn 't take any more ! so happy i went . the wait was too long ( and there were plenty of tables available ) , but i was happy once i got inside . highly recommend it !
1	only in vegas ! this is the perfect greasy food for your hangover cure !
1	) . great food & nice ambiance , but very slow service . don 't be in a rush & you 'll enjoy it !
1	i always get their chicken and waffles , perfect pms dish , my mouth always starts watering when i think of it. so freakin good ! their chicken fried steak and gravy is really good too . can 't wait to go back , i 'm already getting cravings .
1	excellent food - huge portions . our waitress jamie was great very personable and attentive . we will definitely be returning . the menu has a large selection to chose from .. something for everyone .
1	yikes ! ! yes i will admit i have a fear with heights but after alot of drinks i made it up to the top . the food here was amazing ! the service was world class . but you get what you pay for here . would i come back ... yeah probably once i 'm not ballin on a budget .
1	nice roomy seating .. large raw bar with plenty of seating . friendly staff . plenty of smiles . lobster soup was excellent the salmon blt sandwich melted in your mouth . fresh buns and the side of slaw was fresh and unique with pineapple chips in them . very tasty . a little pricey but you get what you pay for . a seafood winner !
1	got cynthia again . just perfect service . small issue handled ! ! ! ! ! ! no problem . would recommend to all . new gm , great service and great food . this is now a five star for us . love it . get cynthia for great service . well done love the changes
1	love the ribs , wings , smoked sausage , bbq burger ( available on mondays ) , and brisket ( available on thursdays ) . the owners and staff are always friendly and make an effort to get to know you . give 521 tega cay a shot and you 'll be a regular before you know it ! enjoy .
1	if you love " wisconsin " food , you will love this place .
1	it 's enough to make you content . extremely fresh and delicious . definitely going to be here often for lunch ! cash only , long lineups during prime times .
1	the smoke house burger , loaded fries ( don 't forget to request some cherry peppers ! ) and some amazing frozen custard . i always enjoy checking out the special flavor of the week . also , i 'm pretty picky when it comes to milkshakes , but this place does them right . they 've never lost any flavor , they 're very rich and thick . this location is great because it 's never going to be quite as crazy as the one on the strip . that means shorter lines and shorter wait time ! also , the service is very friendly and helpful !
1	worth it ? yes . by far the best buffet i have had in my life , the quality of all the food here was well above what i had imagined it would be . the beef brisket they had here was worth $ 55 dollars alone . and for the price you get a glass of wine or beer . they have something for everyone , if you a bit hesitant to try it because of the price , just do it , it is worth it .
1	that 's all you need to know . the burgers are damn good too . they aren 't at harbord room-level , but just one-tier below it . definitely get there as early as you can because they sell out . which will just leave you so so sad .
1	food was on point and we had a great time . we were in our own area since we had a large party , but the atmosphere was great and the service was quick . the waiters gave great recommendations and were happy to assist us . had the lobster bisque to start which was amazing . for the main course i had the ny strip with asparagus which was cooked perfect . would return .
1	this texas style bbq the way i remember it . brisket comes shaved , not chopped , with a healthy dose of sweet and lightly spicy bbq sauce . i also loved the rib tips , as well as the pulled chicken , and everything we had was excellent . i 'll be back for sure .
1	it has been awhile since i 've given a place 5 stars but this one deserves it b / c of the food , service and special cocktails . all 4 dishes were magnificant : broccoli salad , pan seared scallop , filipino fried chicken on brioche ( taste like mini mcchicken sandwiches but better ) and lamb kofta lettuce wrap . each dish was unique and satisfying . i highly recommend the burbon cocktails . must try
1	had the scallops special and the salmon special and they were both amazing . the mashed potato and risotto cake sides were amazing and the vegetables were amazing . there was probably too much butter on the food but it was sooooooo good . 3 / 5 on the atmosphere . it is in a small mall . fine since everything else is closed . not romantic at all . would definitely come back . a little pricey .
1	i agree with their saying , " think global , eat local . " i had the monterey scrammble and added avocados to it and my taste buds were more than satisfied . it was hard for me to choose this dish , seeing as there was many options of eggs and i wanted to try them all haha the atmosphere is trendy yet casual and laid back . the service was on point and super friendly ! definitely a place to bring the family or your group of friends for a delicious brunch : )
1	the customer service was top notch , " kris " is the lady who was serving was friendly , attentive , and helpful . the cook also stopped by to say hello and and asked how everything was . i could not stop praising the fresh , all white catfish , homemade mac & cheese , yams , and mashed potatoes w / gravy ! my experience was so fantastic , i promised to come back with my family and even got a to go order of chicken for tomorrow ! if you 're looking for a soul food place that beats m & m 's , ella em 's , hush puppies , etc. you have found the place ! thank me later !
1	came here on a weekday night to celebrate an anniversary and was seated almost immediately with a reservation . every lady gets a rose when you come in which is a nice touch . never had to ask for a thing as our server was constantly filling our glasses and asking if we needed anything . sorbet was given to cleanse the palette which again was kind of cool . we ordered the filet / shrimp combo & a chicken dish ( can 't remember the name ) . night ended with our server comping us a free dessert and wrapping our rose to go . has an old school vegas vibe to it which was unique but definitely worked .
1	the bellagio buffet offers a wide selection of asian , american , italian , and seafood . soy duck , chorizo , tuna hand wraps , snow crab legs , flank steak , caramel brulé , etc can be found . service : concierge is nice , waitress was prompt . be sure to get a mlife card to avoid line ups quality : the quality is definitely a step above your average buffet . the snow crab legs were full of flavor , the prime rib was not overcooked or lacking flavor . the tuna hand wraps tasted like the real thing if you 're looking for a solid meal but wanting to keep it casual .... the bellagio is the place !
1	i usually don 't write reviews but it 's worth giving this place a try . it 's hidden away next to mccaron airport across sunset park . the philly cheese steak is one of my top 3 favorite in las vegas . there delivery is always fast and efficient .
1	came here on a week day night and was not let down . made a reservation but probably didn 't need to , wasn 't overly busy . food is family portion style , octopus and hummus were really really good ( can 't remember everything we ordered ) . finished with some sort of chocolate cake with strawberries and bananas . do yourself a favor and check this place out , a +
1	i travel to the east side of cleveland frequently for work and am always searching for new spots to dine . 56 kitchen 's menu is diverse and well rounded providing the guests with a wealth of delicious entrees and options . vegetarian , vegan and gluten-free options are available as well making this a one stop shop for everyone . i recently had the hawaiian pizza and french kiss salad and was very happy with the quality in both presentation and taste . if you are seeking a new restaurant in the solon area , 56 kitchen is a must try !
1	7.99 , all you can eat buffet , including an omelet station . french toast , pancakes , eggs benedict , fruit salad , etcetera were all top notch , and i highly recommend it !
1	2 eggs , a choice of protein , hash-browns , a pineapple slice and coffee / tea - what a steal when in vegas ! xoxo amy nguyen
1	2 eggs , 2 bacon strips , hash brown & toast .. can 't go wrong ! !
1	the gyros are stuffed with delicious meat . i would prefer a little more tzatziki sauce , but thats just personal preference .
1	i got - fried chicken , bbq rice & veg mom got- jerk chicken , rice & peas , coleslaw moms first time having jerk chicken and i 'm glad it was here ! ! ! ! authentic & & delicious .
1	good portions , great taste . thanks ellen for letting us know about this place .
1	we came as a party of five at around 1am and were seated immediately . service was attentive . they were always checking up on us and refilling our waters . steak and eggs are cooked to your liking . you also get a choice of toast , as well as hash browns . extremely filling ! fantastic portions for the price ! i would actually recommend sharing if you aren 't famished . this place may be a bit hard to locate . it is in the 1pm direction of the casino . definitely worth hitting up when you 're in town ! also , no split checks allowed so have cash or venmo ready if you 're coming in a big group !
1	we came here because it was cheaper than at ellis island haha ( only by $ 1 though ) . it was pretty great to finally try a midnight / late night steak and egg meal , and we are happy we came to this restaurant . the meal came with steak , eggs , hash browns , and buttery toast , with plenty of jam to go with it : d it was definitely a great meal and a great deal !
1	the steak was actually great , cooked to medium perfectly . ordered pancakes too which were delicious . slightly off the strip but worth the drive or taxi or walk . you can 't find more food that is actually great for this price . the casino is nice too which makes the 35 minute wait managable because it has $ 5 roulette . staff and servers so friendly too . go here , you won 't regret it .
1	wait , what ? ! you really can 't beat this deal ! steak , eggs , potatoes to your liking , and your choice of toast . 11pm-11am is the magic time . but wait , there 's more ! $ 9.99 and you 'll get a drink of your choice ( handcrafted root beer or a ice cold glass of their microbrew ) and a steak dinner . you can 't ask for more ! love coming to this place !
1	steak medium rare done properly . best place to eat for late night on da strip . its great service with a great price . : d
1	organic coffee ! several interesting books to read and relax in upper loft ! delicious food , great service .
1	the staff was very accommodating of our party and the food here was well worth the wait ! ! if your ever in the phoenix or scottsdale area this is a definite place you want to stop and eat .. on our next trip out here we will definitely come back ! !
1	girls in the overnight are happy and nice . location is kinda clean . but most important staff works hard and made the food fairly quick .
1	$ 5 before 5 : ) got to love a " pitcha " of brew for that !
1	great burgers . also have the no cost option of chicken boob or turkey burger ( which was surprisingly juicy ) , different flavored mayos , and fry options . i have only been there for the burgers so far , so that is all i can comment on . service has always been good . i hope more people start taking advantage of the burger special to keep it going !
1	i 've never been disappointed by the food or drinks here .
1	do it ! my fiancée and i had dinner on saturday night with a reservation for the table in the vault . she was amazed to see that they offered a gluten free option for the 5 course dinner . we opted for the wine parings with the courses . what a perfect dinner , we did not have to decide on a thing , everything was selected for use from the food to the wine . the service was just as amazing as the food . a truly special dining experience in cleveland .
1	great energy , fresh and innovative dishes and great cocktails . wait staff works hard !
1	alex was our server for my folks & 2 boys and he has his stuff together . he made our sunday lunch experience one to remember and the food was great . i recommend the ribs as my kid loves them ! will definitely return .
1	5 dollar happy hour wonderful sliders , double stuffed potato rolls thai chicken and shrimp spring rolls pork tacos and drinks , wow great it 's a must
1	but the new deep dish pan is worth the few extra bucks and steps it up for the ready to go idea ! !
1	staff here always a pleasure and the place is very clean . love jimmy johns . conveniently located off the 215 and charleston so if you 're headed hiking to red rock , grab a sub for the road !
1	great food , great meals and rock bottom prices . the line is always out the door and this is a super long restaurant and that says a lot . and given the fact that the area has many times of similar cuisine which have low prices and high quality , the fact that people come her says a lot . whenever i am in the area i spend maybe $ 25 or $ 30 and that gets me and the gf food for days ! if you are ever in the area you must give it a shot !
1	patio seatings the way to go when enjoying happy hour . also a great place to watch games . great investment mikey bidwell
1	awesome food , even for not being vegetarian . we 'll be back when we stop by vegas again .
1	went w 3 others i work with from all over the country . i started w beets salad and had the pork chop . both had great presentation and quantity . had a glass of cab . $ 68 total for a dinner that in nyc would have been easily $ 140 and in dallas at least $ 110 . ambiance and decor was modern chic . amazing meal really . all guests at my table were very impressed . i 'll go back .... in fact i can 't wait to get back to cleveland !
1	fries + $ 3 surprisingly delicious ! especially for airport food , the price is not bad at all at around $ 11 for a meal and it tasted great . soft bun , high quality patty , and who can deny a fried egg in a hamburger ? ? ? the fries were on the healthier side similar to in n out , but with a little more seasoning . they tasted amazing too . very fast service too , i don 't see anything wrong with this place at all .
1	this place is one of my top 3 spots to eat . the food is always excellent . the service is even better . the feta fries are to die for . the only complaint i have is it i wish there was some closer to my neck of the woods , summerlin . but it 's always worth the trip ! ! thanks great greek for living up to your name ! ! ( :
1	service was great as well . will definitely be back !
1	great food good price nice atmosphere and they also sell beer soda root beer floats and much more .
1	if you are unaware of 5 guys then you have been living on mars , in a cave with your eyes shut . i could argue that i find it the best burger place in town . the service is courteous , the place is clean , ordering is easy and free peanuts are a bonus . we ordered and sat down and the guy behind the counter brought our food to us , something that usually doesn 't happen in a burger joint . if you have never been to 5 guys , you are missing out . might i recommended go on youtube and watch " dyamdrops 5 guys burgers and fries review " for inspiration .
1	wish we had one in hawaii , but i guess i 'll have to settle for visiting whenever i 'm in vegas . this location is very clean and employs a friendly staff that definitely knows teamwork ! great experience 5 guys !
1	the food was really delicious too . if i lived closer , i would come more . the patio and location cant be beat .
1	i 'm a vegetarian , and off the menu , there is a grilled veggie subsandwich , that 's hot ! superb value , excellent authentic taste with natural ingredients. this is the place to be. excellent service , great location , perfect food ! ! : - )
1	5 minute walk from my spot .... full bar , they open at 9 am .. perfect for day drinkers. awesome staff. melissa is a queen , and is really , if she keeps working day shifts - she will quickly become my new bff .
1	unfortunately it had to be early . when you got there you had to wait in another line up before they seated you . we waited for about 5 mins and then got in . we each ordered different foods . i got the beef wellington , cutting through was like buttwr it was amazing ! ! ! ! ! we also shared a few sides which were also all amazing . we had the mac and cheese , pureed potatoes , baked potatoe . all were great . finally the bill . it was definitely not cheap . 530 for 5 . but the experience was cool .
1	5 of us came for breakfast short wait at 9 a.m. we all had something different and all meals were very good outstanding waitress will be going back soon
1	the service was good and the food was excellent . i had the fillet with the duck liver on top . omg i cant explain how tasty it was in words . the desert can use some improvement but i am not much of a desert guy . i would recommend to sit next to the window so you can enjoy the show . depends on time of the year sitting outside might be too hot but best .
1	what a wonderful place . all of the food was great . i will go back if i 'm ever in cleveland again .
1	our waitress , rosalynn , was terrific . the food was very , very good and the portions were generous . the atmosphere was very pleasant . great experience .
1	we have made this an annual stop over the years and are always pleased by the team that takes care of us . asking to split 3 steaks is always no problem for this crew . love the large cubes for my makers mark . the sides were perfect , and complimented the steaks nicely . we ordered the ribeye and t-bone , they were cooked exactly as requested . for the desert we sampled the monkey bread . it is the perfect end to a great meal . we are looking forward to the next visit .
1	we were warmly greeted at the door . karen , was our server and she was wonderful - funny , pleasant and on the ball . the food was also great . i had the citrus salad with chicken added ( karen 's recommendation ) and it was amazing with finely chopped apples , mandarin oranges , red onion , blue cheese crumbles and a poppyseed dressing . my companions had the salmon salad and quesadillas which they all raved about . we all really loved this place and having just found out it 's locally owned makes me like it even more . i highly recommend this place .
1	absolutely recommend this restaurant ! ! i 'm not normally a burger person but this is seriously the best burger i have had . the bean burger is fantastic , the turkey burger amazing and the mushroom burger unbelievably good . highly highly recommend this place ! ! the vibe of the restaurant is as good as the burgers ! ! i didn 't try the milkshakes but they looked yummy ! ! ! the fries ... delicious ! ! defiantly a must to try !
1	food was delicious ! eggs cooked perfectly and to cap it off the service was flawless ! highly recommended , will not disappoint ! do yourself a favor and check it out .
1	the retro atmosphere was fun . i 'd recommend this place if your looking for an old school , main street kind of meal .
1	i had the best steak i 've ever had in my life . it 's pricey ( about $ 60 pp ) but the food is amazing . great for a special occasion !
1	the beer is fresh and so us the food . the waiters and waitresses are great too . it 's also a good place to watch any sports games or have a guys night out .
1	janel was the best server ever ! ! this place has such a nice and homey feeling . the food is so good , i recommend the chicken and waffles or the french toast ! !
1	outstanding . great service , excellent wine list with some relative bargains . just remember it 's vegas . had the soft boiled egg with black truffle and the veal cheeks . dinner companion had lamb saddle . all delicious . would eat them everyday if my cholesterol could handle it . service excellent . a lot of young hipsters and dressed up folks . would return tomorrow if i could .
1	do you ever get annoyed when you 're at breakfast and you have to literally stare down the server with dagger eyes to get a refill ? our server came to our table , i exaggerate not , 10 times to refill our coffees . i had to put my hand over my mug at the end to keep her from refilling . it was heaven . i haven 't had a caffeine buzz like that in a while . the kind where you can feel it behind your eyelids . 4 ) the tablecloths . so unique . 5 ) decently priced . bill came to $ 16 for eggs benny and coffee ( 10 cups of coffee though )
1	$ 5 shot wit a beer that cesar salad - have no fear pepperoni pizza , the choice is clear cpk is the airport restaurant of the year ‍
1	awesome food and service . you can tell they appreciate their customers .... we ordered the # 1- gyro plate , gyro was very good and the fries were definitely something to write home about ... our favorite gyro place shut down about 6 months ago .... we have absolutely found our new favorite gyro place . thank you pits kitchen !
1	seriously stay here if you want to be pampered .
1	customer service is awesome ! ! great place to stop and get some healthy food ! ! turkey corizo panini is bomb ! !
1	good service , hardy servings , of delicious amish made favorites . save room for a piece of fresh made pie !
1	how anyone can walk by the smokers is beyond me ! best ribs , corn bread and ( collard ) greens i. have.ever.had ! with a freshman at pitt , we will be back . oh did i mention rib dinner with two sides plus corn bread was $ 12.50 ? yum ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	manager and i agreed that we didn 't like the patriots ! everyone in there was super friendly ! oh and the sub was perfect !
1	they have the freshest vegetables and a great menu selection of healthy foods . the vegetable crudités and quinoa burger are amazing ! the seasonal grapefruit soda is bomb as well ! only downside is they always seem to be busy , so expect a wait . it is still one of my favs though !
1	the amazing burger ( the big t burger ) was shared and more than enough . great home made chips and wings were great too . definitely recommend !
1	deliciously wood-fired , slow-cooked , tender and moist chicken roasted to perfection with an outstanding flavor . unlike other large chain restaurants with mediocre quality , this place always offers the best . small simple menu sticking to what it knows best since 1944 . everything to the sauce fries and coleslaw is done right . one of my favorites !
1	plus it 's a 7-eleven , they are like everywhere and specially at vegas you need access to cold drink driving around this town ! oh yeah , they also have a gas station at this 7 / 11 .
1	steak and eggs were fantastic , well cooked , mash was awesome . brioche bread as a topper , tasted like desert .
1	it is my second time coming to d 'lish and i just more in love with the food and service . the popularity of the restaurant is amazing ! # healthy # organic # cantnevergowrong
1	we used a buy one get coupon from the hotel and enjoy a breakfast well worth the price . left extra full and the service was good . the omelette lady was awesome ! ! ! would come back !
1	everything is fresh and delicious . i highly recommend it if you like pakistani and indian foods .
1	i have to say great food great and great service ! if i pass through again i will make it a point to stop .
1	i give it 5 stars because going in i know what i am getting . this a 2 egg , meat , grits / hashbrowns , toast / biscuit type of place . yes sure they have pancakes and french toast but most of the people are eating the $ 3.99 special . i eat here quite frequently because it is cheap , convenient , and it taste good ! oh and when you come , if you are getting a tea or coke then you can bring your own cup because they give you a small styro cup that just gets your mouth wet ... not quench your thirst .
1	i 've been to chicago and this hot dog is almost exactly the same . it 's a small mom and pop place with straight to the point service . always order the dog with everything on it otherwise you 're just not getting the full pleasure of a chicago style hot dog .
1	not only was the food amazing and the design of the restaurant but service was superb too . all portions were very big . my lamb was to die for . ambiance out of this world . i normally do not eat bread but i just had to here .
1	great sandwiches , good service . call ahead to see how long the wait is . they turn tables quick and staff up so wait time isn 't bad . located in front near chandler mall fountains . you can walk around with pager .
1	still miss the special bread they use since i left . you need to make a trip there if you are in vegas . a must ! ! ! !
1	their cookie butter french toast is unreal ! ! ! we showed up at the height of their busy hour . that hour when people finally decide to roll out of bed from saturday night . they were very busy and the wait time was expected to be 40 minutes but we were seated and waited upon in 10 : ) . everyone there is always so happy and up beat . great way to start my day . thanks babystacks ! ! ! you guys rock !
1	food and service were impeccable . food was delicious , wait staff was very friendly and accommodating too ! sliced pork place with fries and cornbread was good too . very good , very good value for the price and a convienent location at that too ! thank you . : - )
1	get the zack 's special if you 're a big mac fan and don 't skip the onion rings
1	breakfast eggs bacon and best home fries in province ! delicious baked beens . poutine best in town because the fries are made fresh . chicken yero tasty . definitely will return again and again . staff friendly ! price is good . great place to take my kids . many variety of food offered at a low price .
1	this is a picture of their outstanding cinnamon bun pancake ! and they scramble their eggs to a light consistency that is out of this world .
1	this place is awesome ! i see people complaining about its loud , noisy etc , the place seats around 500 people and most nights it is packed ! why = because the seafood is the best anywhere around here ! with 2 people no wait , 5 people or more you will wait . but once you sit down , its ordering and coming fast !
1	you don 't find that very often . love this place . thank you dave at the bar . we would eat breakfast here too if they were open for it .
1	i ordered the 2 meat combo . 2 ribs , sliced brisket and mac n cheese . everything was great ! i first tried them at the pigs for kids bbq competition . my favorite bbq place in vegas . thanks rs bbq and thanks to karina at the front counter !
1	amazing service , atmosphere and food is phenomenal . we were very pleased to see how low calorie or food was for such a nice meal . we will be back ! we recently went to their yelp event and loved the fall menu as well ! ! negatives : none .
1	this place is on the pricier side but it was worth it in my opinion . service was fast and friendly also .
1	my husband and i usually go there we had a great times every time , i recommend to going there my favorite juice is lemonade strawberry
1	$ 20 ribeye ! yumm nom nom nom ! 2-3 for our waiter ehh not so great !
1	looks like a mini fluffy pillow ! sooo cool ! mixed grill was ok . the beef sirloin was way overcooked and def. not juicy .
1	5 star from me for this restaurant food is amazing service is awesome .... ambiance is so romantic thumbs up all the way
1	all servings are huge . you could easily share salads , sides , and deserts . i loved the ambiance of the restaurant . it felt , sounded , smelled , etc. like a steak house .
1	also great value - gyro meraki is 8 bucks and is excellent . gyro with beef / lamb- the meat was delicious . feta fries are also great . service is old school and fairly fast and friendly . food takes about 5-7 minutes to hit the window . been here a few times now and they are very consistent . 5 / 5
1	excellent service , food was impeccable on all levels , from apps to main course . will make this one if my go to places for an amazing dining experience . great job !
1	as if the $ 3 long islands , rail drinks and drafts weren 't enough - the bar side of paisan 's now serves up chicken fingers among its handful of happy hour munchies . you could sit in a cozy booth ( or out on the patio , not recommended november-april ) and have a couple of drinks , fries , and of course , chicken strips - and land yourself a $ 15 tab . not too shabby . i 'm not completely sure which hours are happy . it starts early , i want to say around noon , and goes until 6 : 00 or 6 : 30 .
1	we had a bunch of beverages and a bunch of food for 35 bucks ! can you believe that ? the bartender ... i think his name is geoffrey ... took great care of us . next time we need to leave room for a pizookie . that harvest hefeweizen is so good it took me back to old bavaria and made me blaspheme . now that 's a great beer ! we always enjoy stopping in at bj 's .
1	wide variety of breakfast choices quick and friendly . if you get there after 9am you will have a 30 min wait when there is an event across the street . lunch always seems to be fine
1	if youre on a ketogenic diet this place is a definitely a place to eat for keto . i ordered uncle sam no bun very delicious and southern style omlette no lyannaise potato sub with cold tomato . highly recommend breakfast joint .
1	i went there 2 days ago . they 've dish of different steak and ribs that you have to try it .
1	excellent food ! french toast is to die for , the granola is fantastic , and the fresh squeezed orange juice and the hot chocolate are both amazing . had to wait a few minutes for a seat , but our waitress was super sweet and attentive . the portions are huge though ! wish i had shared with a family member , we had a ton of leftovers . if i lived here i would come here all the time . the atmosphere is cozy and comfortable , kind of a cross between a little diner and your local ihop . love this place ! really is the best breakfast restaurant in the valley !
1	the roasted salmon with a cauliflower purée was so amazing for only 16 bucks ! the girl had the blt which i also tasted and was good with a nice and different interpretation from your regular blt . the tea choices were also exceptional , i had a pot of both the helen earl grey and the english breakfast . for dessert the creme brûlée was on point . i would recommend touring the main house and visiting the whole estate and afterwards have a meal and tea before you get back on the road .
1	it 's a massive , full of flavour , and leaves you satisfied . i added cheese which just added to this ' fat kid special ' . yum !
1	my husband and i love to visit this place : ) we just found out there is a birthday beer mug for $ 3 any beer choice and ps it 's a huge mug ! i had a delicious chicken sandwich and my husband had the peanut butter and jalapeño jelly hamburger which he loved . we love most of the beers they create and always come back to try the new offerings . def a date night out for us !
1	perfect service , food amazing . they have the truffle of alba ... that s awesome . the best restaurant in vegas for quality of service , food and it s very quite . there isn t the music . ( finally a place where you can talk ) highly reccomended .
1	great food , my steak and eggs were delicious . the steak was grilled nicely and just how i ordered it . the wife had french toast and gave it a solid review . good atmosphere , competent and friendly staff , and fast service ! what else can you ask for ?
1	in all honesty probably the best server ive ever had , anywhere . great service , great personality . she seemed to really enjoy interacting with our 8 month old the whole time we were there . to top it off she got us a complimentary dessert for my mom 's 50th birthday and our wedding that day . just an overall awesome experience , food was pretty good too .
1	5-star rating was from a wonderful experience that i had here in 2007 but currently it may be out of my price range .
1	our dinner was soooo good and the service was incredible . they treated us so well here . the view was beautiful ( we had reservations right at sunset ) . we ordered margaritas , ribeye and mashed potatoes and they were all delicious but the best thing we got was the scallops . they were wrapped in bacon with a jalapeno flavor that was the best thing i 've ever had ! i could have eaten way more of those . the cost of the dinner was up there but it 's nice to treat yourself every once in awhile and we 'll be back again !
1	just left this place and cant stop talking about how good it was . starting with the service which was beyond excellent to the gourmet food and the delicious desserts . enjoyed every minute of it ! ! if you are staying at the cosmo or happen to be in the area make sure you visit this amazing restaurant .
1	it was delicious and i loved the bbq sauce that is served with it . hot table they have is average as many of the items i have tried on it were nothing special . love the whole bbq chicken . maybe they should add bbq ribs to the menu - mazel tov to that idea !
1	how goofy and clueless do you have to be to present a c note in a fast food restaurant ? ten people in front gave 20 's ? cmon . you can 't be serious . mikey do you think maybe the policy is to keep the young kids from being held up even more often than normal . it 's obvious that you are limited .
1	one of my favorite higher end restaurants in tempe ! my company did a holiday dinner here and i thanked god they did ! we tried to book it again for the next year but they were already booked ! their chicken is to die for and so are their potatoes ! fresh salads that i also highly suggest ! great drinks and over all good vibes ! the patio is super cute and great to sit outside at night ! please go here ! you won 't regret it ! p.s. did i mention the service is amazing ?
1	5 star chocolate chip pancakes . the best breakfast in pittsburgh . just drooling thinking about this place right now . i always get the big lincoln , and chocolate chip hot cakes . the potatoes are so legit , it 's not even funny ! the big lincoln comes with 2 decent sized hot cakes , 3 eggs , 2 sausage links or bacon , and those potatoes . add cheese if you want to feel bold about your self . delicious
1	every single piece of this place is outstanding . the food , the service , the ambiance , and even the wine list ! if you have been here , come again and bring someone who has not . they will thank you , maybe even ask you to marry them .
1	burgers were perfect and amazing milkshake ! friendly staff , fast service . if anything to critique , is the odd sized goblet the beer served in ? ? just out of place ...
1	i went in already disappointed thinking my service was going to be terrible like before at a different location . food was great , fast and what can i say definitely a 5 star for the awesome customer service . my waitress was amazing . she was always checking make sure we had everything we needed . didn 't make us wait for long on anything . she was very talkative , her recommendations were great . she was jus plain amazing ! thank you marissa for a wonderful experience !
1	my husband is making it a habit of taking out from edens at least once a week . we usually share the adam and eve which is a big portion . the meat and chicken and really juicy and seasoned to perfection . i believe it is family owned and they are really nice . again best mediterranean hands down .
1	5 stars all around home cooking is great cook sandy is friendly and wonderful a must come too place .
1	service was exceptional and so was the food . best steak i 've ever had . got the special beer rubbed bone in . unbelievable . wife got the fillet . just as good . clam chowder was very good too . bill came to $ 188 for two meals , 3 drinks , a soup , and a salad . it 's quality . you get what you pay for . highly recommended . we will return
1	we came with a group of 11 for the start of a bachelorette party . we shared lots of appetizers and a few pizzas - everything was delicious ! can not remember our servers name but he was amazing ! he was very attentive , friendly , and split our entire bill up without us even asking ( remembering what everyone had without having to come back to check ) will definitely come again !
1	chill , eclectic , funky , smooth ... legit ! food , coffee , ambience , jobot has it . reminds me of church st back home , downtown burlington , vermont . short review , no need for anything longer ... if you like great food and great beverages then you need to come here . : d
1	don 't like to wait in line in the shade outside on a hot day ? don 't come here then the line will be that much shorter without you in it . the line does move slowly but that 's only because the guy making your plate is cutting the brisket , ribs , etc ... as you order it , ensuring you get the best quality meats ! similar to the way they cut pastrami at katz 's deli in nyc . if i 'm ever in the phoenix i will always come here .
1	for 5 star yelp searchers like myself this is a must try restaurant . went with waitresses recommendation of fresh mozzarella and spare ribs . great decision !
1	i haven 't tried anything else on the menu , but will one day . their walls are plastered with trib awards for best ethnic food and such , so other menu items must be good . i usually stop for lunch take out or eat in . service is always cool and dining area clean . i 'd recommend here for any gyro lovers out there !
1	5 stars all day .... in a city full of gaming bars and sub par food ( and i 've been to all of them ) this place is a real gem ... very refreshing to be in a bar where people are interacting , enjoying cocktails , and an amazing food program .... everything is true farm to table , i had the pulled pork sandwich , and brown butter shrimp both fantastic ... the music is on point from nas to the beatles , and people were having a genuine good time .... genuine people , the owner stephan introduced himself and you can tell he has a real passion to make this place work .... keep it up , new favorite spot in town
1	food is amazing . bar program is amazing . where else can you have a happy hour everyday 5 - 7 pm , and also enjoy a phenomenal tasting menu that is reasonably priced ? all within a michael mina enviorment ? yes please .
1	excellent food at a great price . the hot dogs with the homemade buns are high quality and the best i 've ever had . the tacos are huge and filling . the lemonades are made fresh to order and are very refreshing . the service has always been outstanding . the employees are sincerely friendly and go out of their way for you . so glad to have this gem in my neighborhood . everyone i bring here becomes a fan .
1	food is terrific . food is out of the world ! i love this view ! everything about this place rocks ! !
1	it was fathers day and pretty busy but we still managed to be seated in about 10 minutes . i was a little surprised by the veggie heavy menu , but everything was so good . i had the eggington omelette with potatoes and their homemade english muffins . everything was so good . even my bloody mary was thick and spicy . our server was absolutely top-notch as well .
1	love love o & b 's ! this location at bayview village is elegant and sophisticated , beautiful location . i have been to other o & b 's before and the food no matter where i go the food is always exquisite . service is always on hand and pleasant . i will never tire of taking a trip to o & b 's .
1	5 stars all the way ... from the friendly knowledgeable good looking staff to the wonderful delicious food .. i don 't understand any ratings less than 5 stars ... " the wait was to long " really ? ? it 's vegas there are a lot of people there .... that 's your complaint ? ? ... then " the prices were a little high ... " hello ... you 're paying for great quality food and in my opinion it wasn 't high at all ... overall experience was great ... i am sure to make this a place to eat every time i 'm in vegas ...
1	the menu delivers from beginning to end . we doubled down on the apps ... shrimp / andouille with grits pancakes and the fried green tomatoes ! ! we split the pork shoulder with sweet bbq and mash potatoes and collards melted in your mouth . found myself digging into my honey 's plate ... thinking why did i split this ? finished dinner with this crazy pb & j desert ala mode ... layered goodness all the way through . these guys do it right !
1	.... great selection of healthy salads , or you can create your own salad , the way you want ! delicious healthy soups , too . it may cost a little more , but you are definitely paying forahigher quality of food , it 's worth it to me , also very friendly service !
1	heard about this place from man v food so i gotta try it out . got there on a sunday noon and the place was packed ! decided that i didn 't want to wait 30-50 minutes for table so we got it to go . the famoud del ray torta lived up to its billing . it 's probably the best one i 've ever had and definitely the biggest . only wish i don 't live so far away or i 'll be a regular here .
1	i came here yesterday and came back not just because of how amazing the cheese steak was , but also because of the amazing customer service ! outstanding ! ! ! i had the bobbie today . i wish i could say something different from all the other reviews but it is just like thanksgiving . it is amazing . the cranberry sauce tastes and looks homemade . the turkey has such and amazing taste that only comes from slow roasting . i can 't say enough about this place it will now be a regular lunch stop for me !
1	last night my boyfriend and i ordered the big a * * burger , and boy was it large , a nice big 10oz burger with all the fixings perfect for sharing , and a steal at $ 10 on happy he i can 't believe that i have never ordered this burger at roaring fork , perfectly scrumptious , and cooked o so perfectly , yum , yum nice lovely establishment perfect for a date night , or a classy business meeting dress code is business casual , so golf shirts gents , and a dress , or jeans and a nice dressy top ladies
1	probably best chicken fingers in town ! get the box deal with toast , fries , chicken fingers , delicious ! many different sauces to choose from ! also , when you bring a new customer ( friend ) with you , you and your friend get an extra chicken for free ! : ) chicken is always super juicy and steaming hot on the inside , i don 't know how the owner does it , but it 's amazing , every time ! the only thing that sucks are their inconsistent , and always changing , hours of operation , so make sure you call , or check online first before you head out .
1	5 stars all the way , this is a place i don 't particular want more people to know about it , the service , food , pretty much everything is 5 stars , but comes with a 2 stars price tab , the server michael is one of the best server we ever had , ultimate service provided and we weren 't in dubai , prime rib rated 95 + , pricing range for the drinks extremely fair , made me wonder are they in business for fun , instead of profit or what , general manager ron a great guy , one of the best restaurant hospitality ever enjoyed , will go back again and again !
1	all the way ! ! ! this place is every bit worth the price and the wait . the food is outstanding and the there is so much you will be full for days . the tables are close like in ny i 'm not crazy about that but i 'm there to eat not worry about who is sitting next to me . check it out its amazing !
1	we came here after our nye celebration .. and it was one of the best choices we made that weekend ! it 's located in the beautiful mall of scottsdale and on a nice day , you can sit outside by the water . our entire group left wanting more . the ambiance is great .. they even have live music on sat 's / sun ! ! i ordered the vanilla bean yogurt parfait and the greek chicken salad .. and it was to die for ! i was also excited to find out that they have one in newport beach .. can wait to check it out !
1	we had a private dining booth with an amazing view . dinner was delicious . i had the shrimp and scallop steaks . husband had the elk . deserts were incredible . service was top notch . fine dining for sure . perfect date night .
1	that 's all i pretty much ate . due to the holiday weekend , we had to wait a bit to get a table and pay more but when we did , we got to relax and take our time eating . steamed alaskan king crab for me please ! the sushi was meh . so disappointing because they looked good but tasted boring . there was such a huge variety of food that i feel badly i didn 't eat anything but the crab legs . oh well . i guess i will just have to go back .
1	smoked meat is delicious . any place you go in town the smoked meat will be delicious . this place is not an exception . its about the sides and everything else . chicken mac n cheese. three thumbs up . fries very good. service is pretty quick and its a fun little spot to have dinner , was packed on a tuesday ( on a tuesday ! # ilovemakinon ) when i went but we weren 't left waiting.i expect its wouldn 't be as pleasant if you went on a friday or saturday night . friendly staff without the attitude for the fifth star in this review .
1	enjoyed a very romantic early dinner with my husband on a very special date . this valentines day is another unforgettable moment in our lives and this restaurant is a very big reason why . everything , and i mean every thing was perfect . amazing table for two , best spot in the house . our captain and his amazing crew did not miss a beat . they prepared our entire menu , we trusted their suggestions and they did not let us down . thank you again for a very romantic evening ...
1	i 've never felt more at home in a new restaurant , the staff and atmosphere make you feel welcome immediately . the food is amazing and the service and staff are even better . everyone is friendly and clearly loves working for such a health conscience and environmentally sustainable business . best vegan food i 've ever found in vegas . the prices are suprisingly low for how much food you get , and for how delicious it all is . i will not rest until i have tried every menu item ! ! friends not food !
1	and this coming from a girl who " does not " eat steak ! the seafood is outstanding . shrimp alexander is divine , crab cakes are heavenly and the molten hot chocolate cake is to die for ! ! ! my husband thoroughly enjoys the steaks each and every time we go . yum !
1	greeted at the site by a charming gentleman holding the door . quick seating by the waitress and we went to get salads . it was at this time we had to make a quick exit . we asked for our check and the manager came over to make sure we were not leaving unsatisfied . he would not let us pay . ( we 'd sat , ordered drinks and gotten some food . hadn 't hardly touched our plates . left a healthy tip and ran out the door ! amazing customer service ! to be continued ... we 'll be back !
1	i went to buckeye , az for business and contacted my friend that goes to pharmacy school in az and told him " i 'm hungry . where should i go . " without hesitation he recommend me here ! i am really satisfied and happy he recommended me bobby q ! the brisket , baby back ribs and baked potato is amazing ! the staff is very friendly and the service is excellent ! i will definitely go back when i 'm in arizona !
1	the food , the crew and the management are top notch . i have been several times and get their gyro platter every time . you can 't go wrong .
1	being from texas growing up with real bbq , this stuff competes with the best of them . i had the brisket and sausage . to die for . jalapeño cheddar grits " to die for "
1	best food truck breakfast ( the only ' meal ' i 've had from them ) . biscuits and gravy , fried chicken biscuit with cheese , bacon and gravy ( ! ! ) and the breakfast biscuit ( egg , cheese and bacon ) all were top-notch . fried chicken breast was moist and well cooked .
1	the store and restrooms are clean . they have a few different brews of coffee available and good snack selection . the employees will actually help you look for items if you can 't find something . holy cow ! ! ! the managers are friendly and helpful as well . this place is packed on the weekends with all the ca traffic coming and leaving vegas . it can be a bit congested at times , but hey , ca folks are used to it . during the weekdays and most evenings it 's easy to get in n out quickly . the parking area and gas pump area is well lit and always looks safe at night . they have a car wash too !
1	had the sesame noodles , ok but not spectacular . fat choy burger rocks . not an every day burger but definitely a must try . i am very much a foodie & moved here from texas . have enjoyed the vast variety of restaurants in vegas , one of the perks of living here ... having said that , this little diner has some special chow , that you won 't get elsewhere . i highly recommend the bao , excellent by my standard . and , lastly a shout out to tammi jo , service second to none . she is a testimonial to a great waitress .
1	this place never disappoints . we come here every visit to vegas , best food , best service awesome . can get busy but you get looked after . inside and outside seating . great price and big crepes . bring your appetite .
1	this place has seriously become one my favorite places to get a quick , affordable breakfast / brunch . ventured off the breakfast menu today , ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was incredible . would absolutely recommend this place to anyone . the care that the owner puts into the restaurant shows through almost all aspects of the place . really a great place .
1	automatic 3 stars for real smoke . another star for the cheese biscuits . ridic . another star for the variety of meats and the signature twist on the carolina pulled pork . the manager , gene , has a great spirit , made me feel very welcome when i passed through on i-85 and ate my face off one night traveling up to nyc .
1	not because it 's fine dining .. because its the best hot dog / fixins you will ever eat ! i 'm a anti processed meat , health food nut & even i cannot deny my mouth the amazing mix of warm / cold / crunchy / soft yumminess of cheffinis !
1	downstairs is hip-hop / old school , i stay upstairs so can 't tell you about that . rooftop is all good - vibe , bar , drink specials . sound system will move you but not excessively loud . this spot is dialed in .
1	you know the food is damn good when a fat man comes in , and starts speaking patios : ) http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = ixpwflzsf4m
1	the view of toronto 's skyline from panorama lounge is absolutely breathtaking . great spot for tourists to stop by and take pictures . i also enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere here .
1	this is an airport bojangles so it 's a litttle bit more expensive but its worth it if you 're in the b terminal . it 's also relatively cheap compared to other places in the airport . i mean come on what are you going to get a bag of beef jerkey from hudson news and a soggy turkey sandwich out of some fridge ? ? ? ? no . don 't do that to yourself . just get some chicken 'n biscuits and start your diet tomorrow when you 're done jet setting .
1	staff very nice , decor or eating inside or outside is great , food excellent . be sure to get sweet potato fries ! btw ... lauren is totally cool and awesome . she makes a fabulous late .
1	my friends and i arrived around 11am . i ordered an irish coffee . the balance between the alcohol and the flavor is perfect . i ordered an omelette ( baja ? ) not too sure the exact name because my mind too occupied by the thought of savoring it and finishing it . although one of my friends complained about the pork sandwich being too dry , everybody else seems to be content with their order . oh and speaking of which , they 're huge , and this is coming from someone who can eat a cow in a sitting . definitely coming back to this place .
1	quick service and attentive ! food compares to a chilis type restaurant . thanks irma !
1	period . the meat quality and flavor is outstanding , the tzatziki is theeeee best and the portion you get for just the regular is more than enough ( the jumbo can feed a small army ) . there is a very valid reason for the crazy line during lunch time ... the gyros are that good !
1	all the other major chain sandwich shops are the same , nothing special . i can make those sandwiches in my own kitchen ( probably better ones ) . not ike 's though , his sandwiches are one of a kind . this location is relatively new and the service was a liiiiitle slow but the food was worth the wait ! i ordered the bbq roast beef sandwich and it was oh so good . generous portion of meat , appropriate portions of all the toppings and the secret sauce mixed with bbq sauce ? yes please ! !
1	i ordered the ( can 't remember the title ) chicken breast : not greasy , not dry , perfectly crunchy ; , grits , eggs , biscuit , house fries . i can 't fix my mouth to call it delicious , that 's a stretch for something that i 'm so used to eating and cooking myself , but i will say it was perfect . cooked to perfection . i 've had the same chick combo at m & m 's and this is wayyyyyy better . of course i 'll be back .
1	everything we ordered was delicious from biscuits to corned beef hash to french toast . extensive menu . wanted to stay and try it all . it just kept getting better with super nice staff and great service . elaborate bloody mary bar . dj playing great upbeat music . happiness !
1	nitza rubenstein exceeded above and beyond our expectations . we had a 5 day catered event in the macarthur room , she skillfully and quietly performed her job and serviced everyone 's needs . you wouldn 't have even known she was there except that at every turn things were taken care of . she literally worked the room . we had an individual with very specific dietary needs , nitza went to great lengths to accommodate her , ending the week with a parting gift of a huge bag of organic , new zealand plums . over the top ! well done nitza !
1	while i adore anthem , i would say this is the closest thing we have to a " gourmet " burger . the onion rings and sweet potato fries are great as well ! i don 't love how the layout of the restaurant is , as it makes you feel crowded wherever you are .
1	here for monday $ 9.99 fillet mignon and martini . great dinning atmosphere , very clean and professional staff , decor reminds me of cheesecake factory . arrived at 6pm with 20 mins wait ( even tho they told us 45 mins wait ) . of course not the best steak i 've had , but it certainly worth a lot more than $ 9.99 . i would pay ~ $ 30 for that fillet with the martini . restaurant ok with substituting martini with a glass of house red wine . i ended up order 2 of these myself ! will certainly come back again . thank you for the great service rebbecca .
1	5 stars because staff is always so nice and if you 're in the mood for some breakfast other than denny 's or ihop , this is the place to be and prices aren 't bad either
1	i always get the holiday turkey . it smells amazing and taste like thanksgiving leftovers which who doesn 't love ? ! ? tuna melt is also really good ! i tried the hawaiian bbq once from my boyfriend but didn 't really like it since i 'm not a bbq or pineapple fan . great food , just wish their sandwiches were a little bigger lol .
1	there was an entire bar of people standing around ( no sitting room ) waiting for tables for which they made reservations . pretty tempted to mention the seinfeld episode haha ... it is their fault . they accept too many reservations . but the food and service ... wow . our server ray was fantastic . i would recommend requesting his service . welcome to cleveland ray ! and chef ... your food is incredible .
1	dakota was very prompt in seating me at a great booth and she was so kind . for once a hostess who actually seemed like she genuinely wanted us there ! our server jordan was very informative and had excellent recommendations . i had a lunch combination with the crave salad and a half blt . so good ! my friend had the bison burger . we shared the mexican roll and were absolutely blown away . we will be back again very soon !
1	i highly recommend ordering their pork carnitas rancheros with a side of work potatoes ! it is consistently busy , but service is very fast and efficient ! also , for your sweet tooth cravings try one of their homemade banana nut muffin ! it 's just heavenly !
1	we were waiting for a lil bit but it was worth it . the chicken canelloni was beyond this galaxy . pearllisa was our waitress and she took good care of us . a must visit in fountain hills az . # authenticitalianfood # worldclassfood
1	brussels sprouts rocked our world . a fun night was had . will definitely be back .
1	i 'm from chicago but visit az often . every time we visit we make it a point to stop at the coffee shop . the joe is out of this world and the bakery items look like they came of the pages of a magazine . the atmospheres is pleasant and the staff is friendly . we ate there for breakfast was wonderful as we sat outside enjoying the flowers and weather . you cant go wrong going here .
1	i 've been here 3 or 4 times already and they 're consistently delicious each time . their plates are large , fresh , very tasty , and creative . they arguably have the best breakfast you can eat , but for sure the best breakfast in las vegas ! . def a must go . it 's off the strip , but its doesn 't take long to get to ; it 's definitely worth the drive ! just get there b4 they close ! ! !
1	this atmosphere is incomparable to any denny 's or ihop that you 've been to . the design of their interiors is unique and provides an unforgettable dining experience . their meals are a little out of the ordinary but if you 're open to it , your tastebuds are in for a treat . i tried their breakfast burrito and pot pie ... amazeballs . shout out to spencer our host for getting us a free pineapple pancake just for being " cool " don 't miss out on this place . clean and fun .
1	the often yelped about salad cart is overrated . plenty of choices for a custom salad , but 3 standard dressing choices . most places boa or any steakhouse has way better salads . the rib eye was terrific and cooked to order exactly how i expected . the room itself was an old school vegas restaurant that impressed me . the hostess was pleasant and the waiter was attentive and very nice . i did not love my side dishes , but they are not a la carte . they were included so i could hardly complain . i had a great experience and will go back next time in vegas .
1	this is my second time getting my car wash here . 22 $ hand wash , wax and all the dressings ! how can you beat that price for the awesomeness ! my car looks brand new all over again . customer service is impeccable and friendly thank you for your outstanding service !
1	we 'll be back for sure . limited menu for breakfast but you probably can 't go wrong with any menu selection .
1	ryan the owner is amazing . great customer service , food and a wonderful atmosphere . definitely will be coming back
1	the steaks are amazing ! servers come by and slice a fresh portion for you whenever you want . the salad bar is great as well . took us about 45 minutes to be seated since we had no reservation but it was well worth it . will be back .
1	we 've been to many upscale restaurants in vegas and have paid so much more but by far this is my favorite . personal service beyond measure . they really listen . the food is amazing and so reasonable ! the salads are so good and generous . i had the best reuben of my life . thinly sliced , no fat and deliciously salty . if you 're on the strip , the cost of a taxi down here is well worth it . you won 't regret it ! the gm case is wonderful . we really appreciated him . our server amanda and monique are great ! thank you all so much !
1	love the happy hour . if my dog could speak , he would probably beg me to take him to the ohso back patio more often . thanks for being so uber dog friendly ohso ! the burgers here are not to be missed and grab a pitcher of beer , it usually makes more sense financially and you 're going to want to hang out for a while .
1	coleen was our server and she was great ! everything always comes out super fast and delicious . get the half and half with protein pancake - i highly recommend it .
1	i have never liked thin crust , until my first visit to pizza me ! there pizza 's are the best , every variety i 've ever tried is super delicious ! the staff is super friendly and this is one of scottsdale 's best new restaurants this year , for sure ! almost everything you can custom make to your perfection , even the drink because they have those cool coca cola machines ! they have a dog friendly patio too , just make sure to be a good parent and bring your leash : ) they have " family happy hour " which is great on thursday and friday . yum ! i want to go there now while i write this review !
1	5 stars excellent customer service excellent giro and fries again , 5 stars awesome feta fries .
1	excellent . exquisite . fabulous . hands down . the best steak i 've had in my life , so far . cooked to perfection in the steak temperature desired . excellent wine selection- reds to pair w / the steak . highly recommended if you 're on the lookout for upscale , good eats .
1	feel i shouldn 't say why and just do a mic drop and leave it at 5 stars . go here and eat .
1	filet au poivre is to die for . this is a steakhouse from the 1950s . classic wood ambiance . classic 50s steaks . classic 50s look . don 't be afraid of the classic styling , come on in and enjoy ! homemade soups , salads , and cocktails . full bar with a decent wine list . there is always a wait , so consider sitting and eating at the bar . fresh steaks , fresh veggies , and solid cocktails . i wonder if dean martin 's ghost is hanging out in the corner with a stiff drink ... i would !
1	chicken shawarma dinner plate will feed you for at least 2 meals . super quick and definitely a healthier option
1	food , service , drinks all were fabulous ! ! including the " meat wheel of fortune " as i call it ! it 's pricey but if you do one nice restaurant on your vegas trip ... save for this ! ! you won 't be disappointed . no bullocks !
1	5 stars for 3 reasons - friendly staff , don 't screw up my food and finally - they give out ems , fire and police discount .
1	that 's right . the burgers are good . what really sets this place apart is the courteous and great customer service . i 've never been to another fast food restaurant that came to your table to ask about your " how is everything " and offer refills . great service good food equals great experience that 's worth repeat visits
1	clean , great service and price . the chicken sandwich has 3 chicken fingers . fries were crispy and delicious . i came here on the way to willow beach az . salads are big and there is lots of different dressings to choose from .
1	the food is delicious from the appetizer to the dessert and of course the cold sake ! not cheap but 100 % worth it ! ! ! the service is second to none ! our beautiful server amber is great !
1	5 stars , however , because the american-born asian waitress was super nice and helpful . she also didn 't charge me for an extra bowl of rice , for a reason i forgot . the tea here is also great . the side dishes are free if you want extras . the atmosphere is pretty cute and comfy . i see a lot of different asians come in , so it 's not just koreans , of course . i may come back next time . : ) i got a pretty good impression .
1	so ono--fresh and seasoned well ! ! ! little " o " is definitely a mini me because she ate a few pieces with me . : ) a perfect light pupu before our food from island grill . i hope we can come back and get some of the salmon poke ( which the guy in front me took the last of ) .
1	come here early or if it 's busy you can grab drinks across the street . definitely give this place a try and you 'll be back . everything is good ! !
1	first off , it 's smaller and not as busy . of course that is something they cannot control . second , the service is amazing ! both girls serving us were great . jamie was sweet and served us with a smile each time she approached our table . i felt she genuinely liked her job . ( very much unlike the one on spring mountain ) third , food was good as always . will definitely come back again . for sure !
1	10 / 10 will get mind blown . would recommend again .
1	the staff was a team and i have never ever received such efficient service . the food was amazing , and very reasonably priced . no wonder there was a line at the door . just make sure to order a little less spicy than you think . my girlfriend likes spicy and ordered a 7 , i like a little and ordered a 3 . both were too much for us . but so soooo good .
1	server welcomed us with green bean soup which helps cool off the heat and hydrate us after a long drive . free to add 100g of noodles for the ones with big appetite . highly recommended .
1	we have been all over the valley as well as california we love food and have tried everything under the sun , this place was amazing and we will definitely come back , even our 4 year old gave this place a thumbs up !
1	the duck is crispy but moist . soups are delicious . don 't be fooled by the look . it 's worth it !
1	from the fresh spring rolls to the best beef lemon grass i 've ever had i am in love with this place . granted it 's a bit of a challenge to get to , but that just ads to the charm . owner is so friendly and staff is beyond attentive . one of my true favorites in charlotte ! !
1	i was very hungry and this place does not disappoint . the ordering process was a little confusing because the food items and sides aren 't clearly labeled . but justin was very helpful and friendly .
1	i eat here 3 times a week ! affordable , filling , consistant , and awesome service culture ! i get the vegetarian ramen w / zuchini every time , it 's to the point where before k get to the counter they have my order ready for me , they treat me like family here and i bring everyone i know ! if you have not been here you need to come !
1	the setting in westgate and being able to sit outside enhanced the consumer experience . prices were appropriate .
1	100 % best sushi restaurant in cleveland , the sushi is very juicy and fried wuton is delicious
1	i 've actually never been to the restaurant but order for delivery all the time . can only imagine it would be even better in person . their broth is amazing .
1	for the amount you get the rolls are a great price , and they 're always quality . and , while it 's not geared for it , it 's actually a great spot to watch sports . good tvs , and they were nice enough to even put the volume on the game when i asked . i 've been coming here for months and i don 't see that stopping .
1	this place is amazing to go with a few friends or on a date , as the atmosphere is extremely cute and relaxing . i refuse to go back to some sushi places in the area since the service here is great ( might not always be the fastest but they care about their clients ) and the quality of food is worth every penny . don 't hesitate to try this wonderful place out !
1	food was ono , taste just like back home . dinner roll was super soft .. love the lumpia .... can 't wait to try other things
1	we ordered the soy garlic wings 2 times in one sitting they were that good ! please don 't ever change we will be back next time we are in charlotte for sure
1	i go there at least once a week. my absolute favorites are without fail the scorpion roll and the shrimp tempura roll. i tried a lot of different sushi places in phoenix , and none had me itching to come back- except for tokyo lobby. the owners / employees are sweetie pies and deserved every single tip i gave , and the food was satisfying every single time. i have recently moved about 9 hours away but every time i visit , i will make sure to stop at tokyo lobby. their sushi is impeccable .
1	everything is amazing . this is the best sushi i have ever had . you must try this place , it is worth every penny . the drinks are good , the steak is good , the sweet potato fries are to die for . i love all the rolls here . delicious . i been to the one in chicago and had to try it in vegas . the best sushi ever .
1	lunch specials are the best deal here : $ 6.95 for your entree , rice ( steamed or fried ) , soup , an egg roll , and a potsticker . thai iced tea is a must . and if you 're looking for curry , this is the best in town !
1	this establishment is amazing . every time my friends and i dine here the crew is friendly , courteous , and on point ! ! the restaurant is clean and the food makes me always get two plates ! ! they really know how to guest guests ! !
1	not this watered down chinese american crispy ginger chicken stuff . ive always had it as take out and its real quality food . the portions of chicken are also ample , not like other places .
1	this family-operated shop has a great selection of items and all the favourites such as the pork bone soup are expertly crafted and taste great . they like to change their appetizers around seasonally to keep things fresh for repeat customers , and there are lots of those at makkal chon !
1	ahi tuna done very well . las vegas-esque roll rolled in panko , check . calamari , thanks much . waffle dessert with vanilla ice cream , holy * # % ^ . proud girl from the bay , i know my fish baby . oh , and manager boy ... hey ; )
1	the hostess and wait staff were so generous and kind , which is hard to find in the costumer service industry . the last two waiters before i left gave us some insight upon korean bbq history and that made my day ! i disliked their green tea , it was just too strong for my taste buds . next time i 'll try a different specialty drink from the franchise . get the red wine pork belly , it 's a must ! !
1	came here twice with my friends and was not disappointed . also , very friendly staff . : )
1	had the savoury wafu chicken and a mille crepe cake ( 20 layers of crepes with delicious vanilia cream ) . so so good . staff are really cute too .
1	great location , friendly staff , and most importantly , amazing quality food and prices !
1	the service was extremely quick , scary quick . meals were out in under 5 minutes for us to cook . service staff was happy and helpful ! beef was extremely juicy and succulent . highly recommend this place . straight off a direct flight from fll to las vegas and this was the best place to head to first , even before the hotel .
1	the decor feels nice and cozy and the staff are always great . they make the best avocado rolls and the inari are to die for . the crispy mini tofu is amazing as well . they also use real wasabi here . if you order a main they will also give you free appetizer of kimchi , sprouts , and vegetables . wonderful food for a cheap price ! the quality of the food always impresses me and i 've never had a bad experience once . this is also my favourite place to get bubble tea from . occasionally the food can take a bit to arrive , but usually only during peak times . and .... deep fried cheesecake ... need i say more ?
1	the ramen feels handmade if not its must be fresh and chewy . the soup base is thick , boiled with the meat . portion enough , price worth 15-17 cad with combo rice don ~ the combo with karage don ... i just want to eat 10 of those xd nicely fried and tastey with mayo / seaweed . they put a heart making them- service friendly , also 10 / 10 .
1	the staff is very friendly and nice . the girl working in the front was happy to help explain the menu to us . definitely will be back to try something new : )
1	employees are so nice and super polite , which isn 't too easy to come across nowadays . they have so many options for your bowl and they have great recommendations for what to add and what not to . all around delicious and clean poke at an affordable price with a great staff as a bonus !
1	great addition to charlotte food scene . don 't hesitate to come in . try the grandma 's bimbimbap and the poke . a + + + + + place .
1	my partner and i randomly found this place when walking around and went for the lunch special which was amazing value for money and then got four of our friends to come the next night for dinner and everyone was so happy ! so great to have something non deep fried !
1	great selection to snack on . food was fresh and you can taste the bbq flavor . the side dishes were incredible , best , richest kimchi i have ever had .
1	the food was delicious and the service was top notch . i 've never had a problem eating at this restaurant and will continue to keep eating here until i 'm broke . if anyone is looking to try a new thai restaurant , this is the place to go . plus you get a free thai tea or coffee when you check in on yelp . ( the tea is amazing ) .
1	good lunch deals , for that quickie to satisfy you and your hangry friends . you rock , don 't ever change . forever yours , lizzie mcguire i have to add more words because nobody likes just the tip .
1	the food was beyond fantastic . i had ben really wanting to try the food since they opened and i was not disappointed . i usually need help cutting food etc . ( my friends too - disabilities don 't lend themselves to stellar dexterity ) and the staff were more than helpful in dishing out food . it might be a tad extensive for some , but it 's totally worth it . great atmosphere for having a social dinner , and the place was packed ! can 't wait to go again !
1	this place just opened up and it is just amazing ! ! very clean and the employees are very friendly . i ordered a poke bowl and sushi burrito and it tasted fresh and good quality ! they had a grand opening deal where you got a a macaron ice cream with a purchase of a bowl or burrito and it was delicious . the prices are reasonable and like other poke places . will be coming back soon . keep up the good work !
1	my favorite is tom yum noodle soup . there are only about 5 tables , i think most of their orders are for delivery but this small place puts out some excellent food .
1	if you can venture off the strip and try this place , please do so ! kiki 's burger : two types of mushrooms , caramelized bacon , sweet onion marmalade , gruyere , with garlic aioli on the side . um , are you hungry yet ?
1	other favorites # 69 tiger roll , # 81 chris special , # 99 john homes
1	sub mix veggies for the choy sum . lang van is the best ! service is awesome . staff is beyond friendly and if you dont know what you want just tell them what you like and they will tell you what dish . it is awesome . my mom went with her book club and they had no clue what to get . the staff brought them an appetizer , then brought them three entrees to share . they all loved it . do not let the location fool you ! ! !
1	i recommend . don 't really understand the bad reviews that wasn 't my experience . the server was very friendly .
1	food and service are still excellent . the all you can eat sushi is worth the price of admission and the hot entrees definitely gives this place extra value for a sushi buffet . highly recommend .
1	$ 4 up-charge for sashimi but i highly recommend as they have beautiful fish . $ 10 includes all you can eat brought to your table- sushi rolls , garlic noodles ( get them ) , fried rice and spring rolls .
1	my husband and i came in for the lunch sushi special . this is a-la-carte- so much better than a buffet ! you can choose whatever rolls you want off the menu that has about 15 choices . you can also get garlic noodles , fried rice and spring rolls . for $ 2 you can add soup and salad . the garlic noodles were awesome and so were the spring rolls ! we didn 't try the rice . this is definitely worth the price , and tastes fresh . service is also fast ! we enjoyed it .
1	came back and francis greeted us , sat us , and remembered us . he remembered 3 of our previous rolls and guessed our drinks too . great service ! i 'm a gm for another restaurant , and i 'll tell you his service is over the top . def makes you feel like you belong there . thanks francis . see you next week !
1	good food and free water . what more could you ask for . * always order for sit down so you get fries included .
1	and cheap amen wish it was down town just went on the weekend ( randomly in the hood ) and ordered the chicken red curry , spring rolls , and a noodle dish and again n not disappointed ! loved everything ! especially the free shrimp chips and peanut sauce !
1	went there for late night dinner on a groupon special . this place did not disappoint us ! fresh sushi , nice decor and great music . and the service was outstanding ! definitely worth the drive !
1	courtney and i already had sushi that day at samba sushi and we could always use more . we ordered the crunch roll and another roll that i can 't remember the name of but after a bit , we split up the rolls where the crunch roll was mine . we also ordered fruit which came with papaya , lychee and pineapple i believe . we also ordered a stars sparkling wine . it was delicious . you can 't miss the sparkly dragon on wall . the service also was not a miss . friendly , attentive and professional .
1	incredible ! the real crab stuffing was the ultimate ' spicy crab ' that all versions of 911 rolls aspire to be . needless to say , i was stuffed myself by the end of the meal . we were told that it took 2 months of recipe development to come up with their mcdonald 's apple pie tribute . it was so compellingly crafted and conjured such vivid taste memories that i laughed out loud after the first bite .
1	you will not be disappointed ! also love their lobster dynamite roll . everything else are good as well . as for sushi , this place is ranked # 1 on my list of best sushi in town . the place is small , so make reservation before you go .
1	this restaurant is the only reason i go to the hard rock . the food is simply amazing . you must try the miso black cod .... absolute favorite of mine , seafood soup is delish as well as the mushroom salad . i have had sushi there a few times but it 's not the star of the show in my opinion . the place is always busy so i suggest making a reservation . now as far as the price , it 's $ $ $ $ ... but you get what you pay for ! ladies i suggest going with your significant other : ) i will be dining there over and over again . simply amazing .
1	best sushi ever ! ! came on a sunday night and it was a 10 minute wait . this place is going to be hard to beat .
1	the most authentic korean food i have ever had ! i was sad that there was no japchae nor bimbibop . but the kimchee- made up for the loss . i rave about this place to everyone in vegas .
1	i 'm so extremely particular about my chinese food that i eat and this is the " only " place that i eat at . i order my specific order and it 's amazing every time . they use various vegetables and their food has so much flavor . so glad i found this place !
1	my fave food truck at go daddy in gilbert . love their pho ! yummyliciously good .
1	seriously . so good i went for the first time yesterday and came back again today . the fish is melt in your mouth good . we had the hawaiian bowl , sweet and sour salmon , and the ginger ponzu salad with yellowfin . all were amazing .
1	they offer ayce but tonight i just wanted something small ... if you like uni ( sea urchin ) this is the place to have it ! melts in your mouth ! all of the fish are fresh ! ! ! salmon imported from scotland .. everything is wild caught and you can tell in the taste of it . oh and ask for the beer thats imported from japan ! ! this restaurant was very clean , customer service was excellent . you are treated with fast and genuine service ! photo : icecream was also imported from japan . it was very light not too sweet it was perfect !
1	always my favorite tofu place for years now and never it disappoint me !
1	lots of tofu , decent amount of meat . rice came in a super hot stone bowl and the banchans were unlimited refills . service was quick and efficient . interior is a little dated in this hidden gem , but the food more than makes up for it . recommend !
1	the bar lost its self and i stopped going in completely . earlier this year i got a coupon and decided to walk in to take a glance at the selection . the restaurant wasn 't crowded at all , but i was shocked how fresh the food looked so i settled down to enjoy excellent cooked crab legs , cray fish , shrimp . salt / pepper octopus .. great cooks and fresh , also ice cold beer . the only thing that can use help with is the sushi . they do not do any real selection but everything else out ways the sushi . enjoy ! !
1	best in the westside of phoenix ! everything perfect every time ! 5 stars
1	so they are offering all you can eat today for $ 10 . the line was out the door probably 50 people standing outside before they even opened . since i was by myself , i only waited 15 min before they called my name . they definitely prepared for today . they were staffed , food was comin out fast and lookin good , tasting good , service was good . the ahi poki was probably the only thing i didn 't really care for . i love ahi poki , just not their version of it . otherwise .... nothin to complain about : - )
1	can i just rent a room here or should i hide in the bathroom inside the restaurant ! i could eat here all meals in my day . i like to eat the gold desserts so when i poop i can actually say it 's worth something ! so bomb i am getting hungry writing this !
1	food is delicious and always perfection . portion sizes are just right for sharing with plenty of meat and veggies where other places skimp and give you a trough of sauce with 3 or 4 pieces of chicken . papadam and sauces are complimentary . get the butter chicken and narvartan korma with paneer . you won 't be sorry
1	would be definitely coming back here ! ! sooo amazing . gives complimary food and even when we were leaving they are so amazing ! ! so delicious the food 10 / 10
1	we are starving after the 6hr flight . " where do you wanna to go ? " " i wanna go pho kim long ! " and so our vegas adventure began . we tried the beef stew pho , the papaya salad and the summer rolls . the beef was very cartilagenous and bony but the flavor was good . service was quick and attentive , and they accept credit cards ! we 'll definitely be back again soon to pho kim long !
1	i 've eaten at this restaurant in the philippine & hawaii but not in las vegas . my god sons baptism reception party was here and it was a party of about 100 guest . the set up was nice and very exclusive . food was amazing ! ! ! ! omg i ate so much yummy food . the service was great as well . i look forward in coming here for dinner again : )
1	tried out the pho with shrimp and it was even better than last time ! ! this is definitely the best shrimp pho i ever had , roping out pho 54 in garden grove , ca ! if you come by and like pork spring rolls , try them here ... nice work !
1	i thought maybe because it was close to closing it might be not so great , but it was it was very good and hot. the chicken egg rolls where crispy and tasty . it was 9 : 45 close to closing and the door was locked and they seen i was in s big truck and they let me in. over all i 'll definitely go back for more . i got the bigger plate and it definitely could feed me and my wife i didn 't even eat half and i 'm full and i 'm a big eater
1	minor flaws = miso suce jn the wagyu beef is too salty service is very good
1	great sushi , customer service and drinks . i think i had 3 rolls and 2 asahis for under $ 20 and it was bomb ! this has become my goto sushi spot for late night dining . just cant beat the price and quality . really gotta check it out , you will leave full and happy . : - )
1	) is the best sandwich i 've ever eaten , hands down ! go nowwwwwwwwww
1	do yourself a favor and order the best hot and sour soup i 've ever had . i really got the feeling that this was not just a restaurant in caesar 's but rather a respite from the smokey , tacky glory that is vegas . one of the most brilliant interior designs , with pops of warm colors heating up the snowy garden that is the inside . the employees were sweetly attentive and i watched them work as a well coordinated team . yes , lunch for two was $ 50 , but it was worth it . i will be back .
1	well worth the money , lots of food that came out fast . best korean bbq ! love the harami miso beef , the beef carpaccio and spicy tuna kimpbap . excellent service .
1	simply our favorite sushi place in the coun-tray ! we had the lunch for two all you can eat . i do really appreciate and respect all the rules laid out for the all you can eat . the owners want you to value and respect all food and not throw any of it away . so , if you are going to eat . you better eat it all and within an acceptable time . all the sushi we ordered was just delicious . picture will speak a thousand words . i will soon load one up of this great experience .
1	came to las vegas a couple times to visit a friend , and after having ramen sora the first time , i made it a point to have it 3 more . so much awesomeness . best ramen i 've ever had , and it 's 4 hours away from me ! booo . they have all 4 types of soup base , although shoyu is my favorite . they describe , in detail , the cooking process to the perfect base . time honored traditions and 10 minutes later , the best ramen ever . i can 't wait to hit vegas again , hopefully in the winter though ! this fine establishment does not serve alcohol , unfortunately .
1	delicious , well worth the dollar to value ratio .
1	i have eaten here four or five times since then . helen y. says phoenix palace acquired a master dim sum chef -- who now brings a relentless attack of treats every weekend . love the pan-fry cart with chive dumplings and rice noodles . also , i don 't have much of a sweet tooth , but the snow mountain buns are fantastic , custard-filled delights . i think they might not be good for you . if you have a few hours to kill late on a sunday morning , i can 't imagine anything better than eating dim sum at phx palace with friends and family .
1	125 beers on tap and add boneless wings well you just got me coming back here for more
1	we often go at night because the price is still outstanding for the quality of food they serve . i have brought many friends and family here because of my positive experiences . i eat a lot of sushi and i can say this is some of the freshest around . their tuna and salmon are so good ! because of the great value , don 't expect to get in and out of here quickly . expect to take your time and enjoy your meal with family and friends .
1	oh , that 's right ! you want to get on tokyo joe 's email list . i get specials / promos emailed a couple times monthly ( bogo 's , etc .. ) & the bday meals certainly warrant the effort . good food which has always seemed fresh .
1	the food is good and service is really top notch . i ordered the miso ramen , and the soup was , creamy the noodles were very chewy not as good as places in la but very good nonetheless .
1	we came here for lunch and ordered three rolls . i 've forgotten the names now but they were all delicious and slightly spicy . service was attentive . rock lobster has more of a bar feel and probably gets really loud and " club " like at night . we did want to try the teppenyaki but they said that doesn 't start until after 5 pm . for $ 20 and fresh sushi , we really enjoyed this place !
1	lunch for under $ 8 ... these other $ 10-13 dollar fast food guys better pay attention cause i can go here twice as many times as anyone else . good job jack
1	can 't beat that ! the wines by the glass are good quality and reasonably priced . the atmosphere is pleasant and cozy without being too dark or too loud . wait staff very attentive - sushi was excellent - will definitely return !
1	my wife and i love great sushi and this place is definitely it . beautiful atmosphere , great service our server was arianna she was very accommodating and pleasant . i have a gluten intolerance . they even have several sauces that are gluten free as well . we ordered the fire dragon roll , salmon lollipop , salmon sashimi , spy tuna , spy shimp we added cucumber and cilantro and a philly roll . all i have to say super fresh . we do sushi take out every thursday and this will definitely be my new spot ! ! !
1	very good . the guy that showed it to me got it with duck . he said it was better than chicken . don 't know about the duck but the chicken was spectacular . and the service was ok . the people were nice
1	or 16.99 if you want egg + short rib . i always order marinated pork and chicken grill them together , ask for jalepenos , onion and garlic to grill with it . the salad and kimchee i mix with the egg and rice and it 's awesome . great value and great food . it 's always packed so expect a wait .
1	everyone ordered differently of course and the food and beverages were delivered promptly . while they accommodated us beautifully i would call ahead next time to give them a heads up about the group size . every bit was eaten except for 4 stray pieces of sushi . thanks to the owner and staff of susiyas for a great job !
1	staff is efficient and quick . lines move fast , and the food is always dependable . great to grab breakfast !
1	it 's not five star restaurant quality but it is darn delicious . sometimes there 's a lull in between them changing the crab tray to a new one . i only get one set of crab legs at a time because i like to eat them hot / warm . if you get tired of butter and crab , then try squeezing the lemon wedges and adding black pepper for a new dip . on some days , they have a special on the crab buffet and it 's even cheaper . at busier times , they use an app on their tablet that will notify you via phone when your table is ready .
1	5 star for the price and the decoration . meat was good , remember enjoy the chicken with cheese . spicy baby octopus was yummy which is worth order twice or more . beef and chicken there were really thick , cut in pieces b4 or while u cooking . the spicy pork is also perfect . need to change the grill often or if u don 't mind . no oil on the grill so it always make meat over cooked .
1	guaranteed to return . i love the banana roll .
1	the experience and the service is phenomenal . kevin is an amazing host and server .
1	service is quick and friendly and my food was piping hot when it came out ! everything has great flavor to it and the recipes are really unique . perfect cure for what you may have been doing there the night before ; )
1	i absolutely love this place ! it 's cheap , endless , and ... most importantly , it 's the best japanese sushi and seafood i 've had in madison this far ! real sushi and sashimi ! also , there 's lobster , shrimp , and oysters on the shell ! way better than those overpriced asian restaurants that leave you spending at least $ 40 by the end of your 1-2 person meal . highly recommend !
1	pho tai nam was delicious and freshly made . the serving size is huge too . will be back
1	couldn 't have run smoother this time . thank you . last time , not so great . food always excellent .
1	birthday dinner , amazing ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! best vietnamese food and customer service in arizona . the spousal unit tried a com dac plate tonight and loved it . i foresee many , many more lovely evenings at pho viet . did i mention i love the peoplez running this joint ? hell yeahzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	service is good , food is delicious , fast and great variety to choose from . i 've been here countless time and was never disappointed once . brought friends and family there a few time and they all loved it .
1	its a great representation of a small korean place often found in the nooks in soeul . ( 10 / 10 ) food the food was really tasty and very traditional . the side dishes are great , the entrees are all reasonably priced ( ~ 9 ) . great food for any time of the day ! ( 4 / 5 ) atmosphere the store is a little cramped but the decorations look good and it feels like a local korean restaurant inside . ( 3 / 5 ) service the waiters were on the slow side and they seem to be always busy so there was quite a bit of waiting . they were otherwise nice and helpful .
1	$ 17.95 for lunch. is it worth it ? yes it is. i didn 't go for the upgrade--just ate all the meats on the normal lunch menu. and it was satisfying and great. service was a bit harried--as lunch rush started , but friendly and nice. i also enjoyed the affogato dessert. if i had to change one thing--the potato salad with corn was way too sweet. and the beef belly was just so so--i guess because i was thinking about bacon too much while eating .
1	bulgogi nachos are lit ! rice , lit , salad lit , water lit
1	each time , we tried one different dish on the menu . we enjoyed each meal . the food was always good , flavorful & fresh . today , we invited two of our dear friends . they too were impressed by the flavor and freshness of all dishes we ordered . sorry , no picture today . 25 mar 16 - great dinner tonight , yet the total bill was reasonable . good value . 16 july 16 - a sign on the door warned customers of recent price adjustments . i think such warning spoke nicely of the owner . tonight 's dinner was very tasty and enjoyable as usual . this restaurant continues to earn our recommendations .
1	after being shut down for illegal labor then changing owners , menu 's ; and almost closing . this pei wei is back to stay ! the menu is back in full force , the employees are vibrant , the atmosphere is palatable and the tea is to die for . eat here as often as you can ! ! !
1	plus a side order of toroniku ( pork cheek ) . best ramen meal ever . i 've tried many places , but santouka is consistently the best . go at 11 : 30 a.m. or after 2 p.m. and there is little to no wait . noodles have the right bite , the broth has the right heat , and the cha shu has a good balance of meat to fat . the toroniku is a new level or porky goodness . worth a try .
1	all the rolls were perfection , and the staff is very friendly . better than yama ! ! !
1	happy hour is m-s 11 : 30-2 : 30 and m-th 5-7 where a good list of rolls are half off ! ! pancho ( head sushi chef ) is super nice and personable . the food / sushi has been consistently good and of great quality . it 's definitely one of the best sushi places with an all-you-can-eat sushi option in the phoenix area .
1	boustan is always my go-to place when i don 't want to cook . once , i accidentally put in an order in between my exams , and had to leave when they showed up . i called after coming back from my exam and the person was very nice about it . she sent the order out again without sounding irritated . i insisted that they charge me twice but she said it was okay . awesome service and amazing food .
1	ac is nice and cold 2 . nice servers and super fast 3 . you should get the ayce option 4 . fish tasted super fresh 5 . great option when you want to eat sushi without the vegas strip price 6 . will come again when here

1	best bbq pork around . its tasty , juicy and tender and the sauce they put on it takes it one step above . 2 . great customer service . they are always friendly . 3 . many fresh menu items . 4 . they tend to be quick this is definitely one of my favorite chinese places to fet takeout ( nevee ate in the restaurant ) . their lunch specials are priced fairly and give you a good amount of food . give this place a tey you wont be disappointed .
1	great atmosphere , great service and great food ! mr. yoon the owner is awesome and adds an incredible personal touch to your dining experience ! ! ! ! highly recommend the geisha roll ! ! !

1	by far my favorite sushi spot with great happy hour prices . even when we travel , we always make sure to stop here on our in between days at home . the nebraska roll and golden philly are top notch . highly recommend !
1	crispy pepper tofu . slightly battered . yummy 2 . beef noodle shop . super awesome with hand made noodles ! ! 3 . orange beef . you can 't go wrong with it ... hmm hmm
1	i had sushi and sashimi . they are very fresh and soft ! 5 . friend had ramen with pork , which i found too pork or egg taste . he liked it a lot . 6. menu was kind of confusing with both english and japanese . 7 . drink menu was really long , but we did not drink . 8 . could try something different next time .
1	soup , hot and tasty . fish sandwhich served hot , great portion . great service , great menu . i 'm from san francisco where restaurants have to be great to survive , but this place serves better food than most . definitely coming back next time in town . oh yeah , great beer specials too .
1	real blue crab ! 2 ) second time i went there i had the lobster sushi roll , etc . real lobster ! 3 ) third time i went there i tried the dinner combo . really great deal ! but service was " so-so " but the food made up for it in a big way !

1	food : the best pho we 've had , hands down , even including what 's available in ny . the broth is dark with herbs and flavor , and the meat pieces are thinly sliced . no need for hoisin or sriracha . the grilled chicken over vermicelli was also one of the best i 've had . tender dark meat slices , cucumber and carrot slices . summer rolls came with a delicious sweet peanut sauce . main dishes priced from $ 8 - $ 12 . 2 . atmosphere : downstairs , very informal and casual . tv in the back . families and couples . 3 . service : good , no complaints .
1	good service , kept taking up our dirty plates right away when we leave them in the edge of the table 2 . you order your food / drinks with ipad 3 . spacious dinning area & i like their booths it has privacy 4 . sushi / rolls always taste fresh & cold never warm 5 . i like that they had deep fried tentacles 6 . like how they added creativity to their plates . for example i ordered beef , chicken , and shrimp on skewers and it came stuck in an orange 7 . they need to add deep fried banana to their menu so i can eat it with my red bean and strawberry ice cream lol
1	go there 2 . get their spicy chicken wings . price so lovely . we 6 people spent around $ 10 for each of us . got tuesday wings special too : 10 pieces for $ 5.99 . way more worth it than st louise . other recommendations : pepper shrimp , curry with roti .
1	great food we were just looking for a quick bite , but we found a gem in the process with this place . we ordered a katsudon and ramen which were absolutely delicious . 2 . great service one lady just went solo with serving patrons , but she managed well and often dropped by to ask how the food tasted and how we were doing . 3 . great atmosphere not a whole lot of people were there so i loved it . we were able to talk comfortably . i contemplated writing a bad review to discourage people from coming here to keep this place a secret ! but a bad review would not do this place justice !
1	great service 2 . best thai food i 've been to in vegas 3 . recommend pad thai and eggrolls 4 . tell them , keno sent u : ) 5 . thank you , " i 'll be back "

1	beef bulgogi cup bap consisting of korean bbq beef served with rice , lettuce , noodles . sauced up with teriyaki and siracha mayo . --- i absolutely loved this ! it was enough for leftovers and so i got two meals for the price of $ 6.95 . after i ordered , it took about 2 minutes for my food to be served ; hot and delicious . 10 / 10 would recommend ! after this positive experience , i am extremely excited to try out other dishes on the menu .
1	that should probably be my shortest review yet . what more do you need ? tasty cocktail and beer and sake ? you 've got it . superb finger foods that are great to share with friends ? you 've got it . close to the subway and not ridiculously overpriced ? you 've got it . oh , and did i mention $ 1 oyster wednesdays ? what are you waiting for ? i 'm out the door already .
1	* recommend to spice lovers 10 / 10 ! + clean restaurant + came on a thursday & not busy at all , so seated right away . + staff was polite and friendly 20 / 20 overall . will definitely come back ! !
1	the food is very traditional to the vietnamese culture . my husband and i always enjoyed the food very much . among our favorite dishes : the pho soup , their grill meat dishes , their special " bo la lot " dishes and their weekend special spicy soup !
1	yes please to extra limes and salt and pepper . occasionally i 'll order a side of rice ( if i 'm super hungry ) , but i mainly order a side of sweet potato fries . i swear , you can never go wrong eating at boing crab ! sometimes there 's a bit of a wait if you come on the weekends around dinner time . otherwise , you 're seated pretty quickly and orders are taken asap if you know exactly what you want before you 're even seated . just be ready to be smelling of seafood for the rest of the day after you leave this place !
1	rapongi 2 . gtr 3 . wsop 4 . tiger dragon 5 . the sauteed mushroom medley ( tons of mushrooms ) just a few of my faves at this awesome place . love the hours .
1	rent a car . 2 . drive here . 3 . eat for cheap . 4 . go back to hotel . repeat steps 2 to 4 if you 're a tourist , until you have to leave vegas . otherwise , you 're just lucky you can come to in-n-out anytime !
1	the curries are absolutely perfect in flavour in consistency , with a wide variety of meat and veggie options . the service is very friendly and warm , and there is a large eat in dining area , which is rare for a roti spot . finally , you have to try the chicken doubles . i have never tasted anything like them and they are out of this world .
1	service - excellent ! ! knowledgeable , flexible , courteous ! ! 2 . lumpia sariwa- fresh , tasty , crunchy vegies and out-of-this world sauce ! ! 3 . chicken mami- most delicious broth , perfectly cooked chicken and crunchy lettuce ! 4 . beef mami - i had noodle soup from hongkong , shanghai , sf chinatown and manila , this has got to be " numero uno " ! 5 . pancit palabok - perfect balance of seafood and garlic together with angel hair like noodles . check out the rest of their menu . i highly recommend this place .
1	2 ) i love the their house pho , it is super good ( its the first pho listed on the menu ) 3 ) if you 're not into pho the bun dishes are equally as good . the stuff here tastes fresh and is one of my favorite vietnamese places ever . definitely recommend checking it out . oh and also this place is pretty cheap , its like $ 8 for a huge bowl of pho .
1	the best shrimp egg foo young ever ! glad the rice inn delivers ! well worth it !
1	stacey is amazingly friendly and helpful 2 . the food is delicious - i 've now had the mock chicken lettuce rape as well as the tacos and i loved every bite . 3 . entrees run a little over $ 10 which is more than i 'd like but worth it 4 . next time i go i think i 'm going to get a few things from the raw food bar !
1	this is delicious , low cost japanese comfort food . teriyaki , panko fish , sushi , japanese curry . delicious .
1	+ 1 star for having a wide selection of asian spices and sauces . + 1 star for having indistinguishable parts of animals that make most people queasy . + 1 star for having real asian noodles . + 1 star for having pocky . seriously , they have pocky !
1	including an aunt who didn 't eat sushi . 5 stars for kids menu 2 stars for decor . a little outdated and akward . 3 stars for service this spot fulfilled my need for sushi , and my wallets ' need for a break from the high prices of the strip . * we got chicken and it was great . all of it ! chicken strips , chicken terriaki , and jappanese fried chicken .. thank you , yelpers .. great job .

1	mongolian is the best . we had family c dinner but we ordered walnut shrimp instead . good size shrimp and the walnut sauce is what i expected . salt and pepper pork chops is my favorite . it reminds me of this family chinese place we used to go in long beach , ca . fish with black bean sauce was good also . i wasn 't too crazy about the appetizer , bbq ribs , it was a lil tough . defintely going back to this place . no need to drive to spring mountain . .. close to our home in henderson .

1	worth the price ! i saw a lot of bad reviews for this place , i felt insecure at 1st , but as checking out this restaurant , i can see the business is getting better . the waitresses are kind of shy .... but they are really nice . good place to have a good meal , a nice combination of seafood buffet and hot pot for the winter . to my opinion , it is much better than the red pot in ca : ) good place for seafood lovers
1	just had the spicy combo bowl with fried rice . delicious ! highly recommend it .
1	kyoto is our go to place but they are renovating right now . hiro is as good as all the reviews say

1	we were not disappointed . we had bento boxes and a couple of rolls . the dragon must have been good because my son finished it almost immediately . i really enjoyed the japanese lasagne roll . the quality and serving sizes were good . the bento boxes by themselves would have been enough but we had to try some rolls . we will definitely be back next time we are in town .
1	the food was awesome , super stoked to have found this place .
1	2nd time was a lot better as they had everything this time and i went in before the 1100-1300 rush ? i 've eaten at cinnamons before in hawaii , and this place is as good as it gets . ask for the coconut syrup for the pancakes as it will , in hawaiian pigeon term " broke da mouth " meaning its really good . staff is great , free parking , and the place is really clean ! cant wait to go back !
1	love it ! ! so much food and oh so good . thank you leah for a wonderful dinner , laughs and great fun ! i 'm oh so full !

1	tried the green curry noodles and a side of fried rice . the portions were health and both dishes were outstanding . more food than i could eat ! i have no clue why i was the only one in the resturant as this place was awesome !
1	any ramen spot i always look for karaage chicken and order tonkatsu ramen . and this place is def on par with the best ! their karaage chicken def reminds me of my childhood in japan and their spicy tonkatsu ramen was delicious -- though the next time i come back i 'll have to double the meat . but other than their food , the ambience and interior design of this restaurant is awesome . definitely a nice date spot .
1	the service was amazing and the food was phenomenal ! ! our rolls had soooo much flavor ! the manager stopped by to check on us a few times and was very sweet ! great prices and nice atmosphere . the best part , food came out very fast !
1	this will become a regular stop on my vegas trips . the portions were big the choice of hot sauces was incredible and super clean . see you in jan for ces , probably several times
1	this place is hella bomb ! best kbbq in town hands down . must try .
1	i always lean more to the sashimi side and it paid off with " the catcher ! " i thoroughly enjoyed the salmon eggs , a jalapeño bomb & and a sex on the beach roll ! ! i will definitely be returning the next time i have the craving for sushi ! !
1	my coworker highly recommended it & best part was they have great happy hour sushi menu & great price . great service & ambiance defdefinitely will be back : )

1	this place is awesome . it is super clean , well lit , nicely decorated and has a feeling of calmness . the hostess was very sweet to us . it was buffet saturday and the choices were plenty for a vegan buffet . rice was cooked perfectly and the soup looked tasty as well . a few desserts for something to satisfy your sweet tooth . the price was worth it . i would definitely go there again . great place .
1	read several positive reviews and thought it would be a good place to take my daughter visiting from boston . i had the pulled pork and it was excellent . my wife had the fish ( mahimahi ) & shrimp and loved it . both daughters had chicken , orange & lemon pepper , and were very happy with it . very generous servings . sides of crab rangoons , cabbage & sticky rice were all very good . ordered the seafood soup w / crab , shrimp & scallops . that will have to wait for home ... too full will definitely be back & spread the word
1	the food was delicious and the portions size was huge . the prices were moderate . our waitress was courteous . the evening ended with a surprise complimentary coconut / pineapple ice cream dessert .

1	looking forward to going back & trying more in the near future !
1	super fast delivery . 2 . very nice delivery guy . 3 . piping hot food . 5 . fantastic food . asian grill has another customer
1	i love the location , friendly staffs , good food , reasonable price . recommended dishes ; king kong roll lollipop roll dynamite roll las vegas roll spider roll sashimi combo
1	the pho here is so rich ! they actually heat up their bowls prior to serving the pho so the soup is kept warm longer . 2 . viet coffee here is bomb 3 . the chicken here is also bomb
1	they deliver ! ! 2 . yum 3 . cheap snacks at 1st friday ( located by the gypsy den )
1	the décor is upscale and classy ! 2 - also came here to have a traditional chinese sit down dinner and the food was great ! portion size of the dishes are good ( not too little ! ) . will definitely be coming back here for dim sum / dinner !
1	very attentive service , and very friendly 2 . reasonably priced 3 . excellent sushi ( i had the rainbow roll ) 4 . my wife had the miso ramen = delicious ! ! 5 . matcha cheesecake - very good would definitely come back !

1	1 word " awesome " 2 words " fresh sushi " 3 words " best in toronto " 4 words " i will be back "
1	super friendly staff and super quick and delicious dumplings ! when i come back to madtown , ill remember i like their beef dumplings very much ! ! ! great value for the amount of food as well ! amazing
1	i 'm serious when i say that you can 't go wrong with this place , especially with the " all you can eat " deal . almost every weekend i have to eat sushi and this is the best in town !
1	i didn 't have any complaints . server was nice and attentive , food came out quick , and the sides were tasty .
1	this will be my go to sushi place each time i visit vegas . staff is very polite , chefs are excellent . it 's a tucked away gem .
1	the workers there are all awesome . i mean really awesome . one of my new favorite habits . going to try to make it at least once a month .
1	how can you go wrong ? ! ! took about 20 minutes to be seated on a friday night , not bad , especially when compared to socal which is at least an hour wait . our server terry was amazing ! ! ! ! very attentive , super friendly and he 's funny ! awesome service ! definitely will be coming back and requesting his section ! thanks terry !
1	i try to get there when they open if i go on the weekend cus it gets very full very quick .
1	great service , our server was especially nice ( ozzy ) .
1	my husband and pretty much ordered every single meat on the menu . and we all loved it . they give u a lot of sides and the soup was good also . the fat ass pork belly is really buttery and they also have the green tea pork . they also have a squid in the menu and my husband loved it . we will defintely keep going back to this place and take all our visitors : ) and recommend to all our friends .
1	plus a special fire roll . it 's chef 's choice dinner combo so i was so happy they were what i 'd hand picked . but better , because it 's a surprise.thank you ! ! the sashimi plate was delicious also with thick cut fish .
1	mido soup , edamame and a salad is included as well . the staff is super friendly and they have tv to watch sports .
1	service , quality , and taste has always been top notch . hands down , my favorite chinese restaurant . i cannot eat egg rolls or won ton soup anywhere else as these are the best i 've had . anywhere . we always order the usual : egg roll , won ton soup , sweet and sour chicken , shrimp with lobster sauce , and general tso chicken . highly recommend ! we make a 30 minute drive just to eat here
1	we sat at the sushi bar and got to order as many of their premium sushi rolls as we wanted which were freshly prepared . the sushi chef continued asking all through dinner if we wanted something else . we also got to order hot food directly from our waitress , who provided quick and excellent service . even dessert was included . wish we had a sushi place like this in san diego .
1	it doesnt get better than that . best sushi ive had in vegas ! fish is very fresh and over 40 rolls to chose from
1	the first time we ate this place , if we came to vegas. the owner talk us , the last day. we ate egg roll , bun bo hue , and broken rice with bbq pork , pork chop. and i order to go bbq pork fo we eat midnight.because we came the last day . bbq pork very good than we eat any vietnamese resto at usa. i gift 7 stars for bbq . i hope , if we go to vegas again , they already reopen. i talk the guy ( i don 't know his name ) " move to arizona " and open bosa 1 .
1	well worth the money . the staff was more than accommodating . i had the potato soup ( delicious ! ! ) , and the bread they brought out as an appetizer . the caterpillar roll ( one of the best rolls i 've ever had ) .. and tried the shoestring fries as well . my friend and i stumbled upon here on accident , after searching yelp for a nearby sushi place . we were happy !
1	exceeding expectations each visit with the quality of food and their customer service which is the gold standard . and they are priced exactly right ( subjective , i know , but right for us ) honestly i simply can 't wait to return ! get your buns in here if you haven 't , yet ! you won 't regret it .
1	all from chinese , vietnamese and a little thai . pho is hot and ready after you order it . no complaints and the staff is friendly . only if they have water infiltration . as they say you can 't have it all .
1	appetizers , soup , sushi , sashimi , dessert , tea and more . listen to all of us and come here to eat your sushi face-off ! this place is amazing - i wish we had this back home in australia - we 'd be in sushi heaven . we will be back sakana !
1	and on and on . this cambodian food distributor has got it all ! only cons : small asian tight aisles per usual and does not accept credit cards .
1	24 hour joints get 5 stars from me just because they are awesome enough to operate all day and serve all creatures of life .
1	do i need to say anything more ? i guess yes , since this is yelp ! ! this place is great . i always get the no.14. its my favorite pho . and don 't forget to treat yourself to some thai iced tea . yummm . just be careful when you go . because this place gets crowded during the normal busy times for a restaurant . but even then , its worth the wait .
1	the food was a little pricey , yes , but it was worth it . nom nom nom ... the service was excellent and the staffs are awesome ! the seats , however ... the booth like chairs ? haha after i sat down i felt like i sunk so low my face is now at the surface level of the table . we ordered chicken alfredo , singapore noodles & teriyaki salmon ( w / o the teriyaki ) . don 't let these bowl that they serve you , fool you ... it looked like a small portion , but the bowl is pretty big . all were excellent items . definitely would return .
1	this north york location has an extensive menu . most everything is reliably tasty . but you must go bbq outside . out back . it opens after 5pm . you . must . oh , btw , there 's free parking out back as well .. that is all .
1	hell ya ! and it 's hella good ! i 've been sick as hell lately ... 4am can 't sleep want soup .... perfect ! and i was sitting at my table and all the sauces and such were full with not sticky nice clean bottles and the waiter hushly came to table removed the plate of sauces so all my bottles were filled to brim . kinda unexpected great service ! get the large bowls cause the regular size doesn 't have enough noodles makes u need and want more ... so good so perfectly made ! ! !
1	24hr. very juicy meats and great atmosphere. service is good. like going here very late night
1	* 168 food selection - japanese , chinese , korean and thai ! * food service is fast * price is very reasonable * promo - 50 % discount for birthday celebrant * wait times can be long if you come at meal times * parking is ample * location is convenient and accessible
1	that is actually really good . i could probably just stop the review now . ok , i will . when we were leaving around 7 : 00 pm on a weekday , it was starting to get super busy . i would anticipate a wait if you go , but it 's worth it ! ayce special includes appetizers and desserts ... entire menu is ayce with few rules / restrictions . yum !
1	? duh -- no-brianer . baked lobster - must have . bugolgi - great option . i mean , honestly ... everything was good to ' great ' . and , our waiter was amazing ... well , service in general , since more people came out to fill waters and bus , and they were great . i was blown away by this place . it 's at the back corner behind target and the entrance is near some dumpsters that stink but even then ... lines . so that tells you something . this is a must try .
1	2 plates of dumplings . i like the price . the food is so good . i recommend coriander lamb , the mushroom and shrimp / pork. the place got bigger after they moved several months ago . no need to wait for eating . better .
1	and it 's cooked when you order , it 's not a buffet so it 's hot and delicious ! very very very good rolls , pretty dang big too ! i highly recommend this place for any sushi lover ! i walked out extremely satisfied !
1	if it was closer to toronto i would go once a week . special place in my heart , great family run restaurant .
1	my husband had the grilled whole red snapper with the beef tomato & basil rice w / mango smoothie and i had the grilled sliced beef with the coconut rice w / pineapple smoothie . both our meals were excellent ! we will definitely frequent this place . staff was helpful and knowledgeable about the food . quick made to order cuisine . worth every penny .
1	this is just as good as viet thai in pineville . the staff is super friendly fast service . clean place . the rice soup is really good .
1	even dessert is good . this place is a magic hidden gem . good thing i don 't live in vegas , otherwise i would get really fat . oh and their oyster is to die for .
1	literally the best thing money can be spent on . unbelievable portions of fish . fast and friendly service . creative rolls . fresh . delicious .
1	made to order nigiri and roll sushi , shrimp tempura , miso soup , teri beef , poke , etc . if you are from hawaii this is a must . lot 's of local food like chicken katsu , pork cutlet , kalbi , saimin , and the list goes on ! loved it !
1	i recommend goyemon to all of my friends coming through vegas . it 's open late as well , making this a sure bet for good dining after a show or spending the day in meetings . favorites : pork belly , ecstasy roll , and the lychee sherbet ! the 911 roll is one of the hottest i 've had , so if that 's your interest - give it a go ! cons : plan on a wait - no phone reservations , but once you are there they will let you wander and text when they are ready !
1	staff is friendly and the wait isn 't long at all .
1	it will continue to be so until either hell freezes over or the ladies working there crack a smile . although the service is atrocious , the five star review is no mistake . the food is that amazing .
1	love it . close off freeway . chicken dishes are yummy , more crispy . beef and broccoli : beef is soft , which i really didn 't like . spring rolls are fried not fresh just fyi , i found out the hard way haha . service is always great . lunch special : $ 7.50 for soup and large choice of meal , til 3pm ! love how it 's all vegan ! so many options ! casual nice atmosphere : )
1	vert tasty chicken and beef . excellent customer service . definitely a place we 'll return to .
1	price is right ! friendly staff . plenty of street parking / easy access . this place is awesome . on days that i can work remotely , this is my go-to spot .
1	they were delicious . i had the combination beef pho and the soup was on point . i loved the hot chili sauce they had along with sirarcha . they served generous amount of mint and lime . the server was fast . the vietnamese coffee here comes with a expresso draining into condensed milk . then you get to mix it yourself before pouring into the cup of ice . this baby is strong . kept me awake for rest of the afternoon at lecture . came here with my wife and long time friend . both of them enjoyed their pho very much as well . i haven 't had pho for awhile and this place definitely delivered !
1	this place will get you full for 6 bucks but taste better then all the other " ramen " places out there . wish i could just live here and just eat all day and night and morning ... sorry getting carried away , you get my drift
1	this is so underrated , its delicious , the people are great , and its quick !
1	they also earn points for the nintendo street fighter theme !
1	enjoyed our experience and food ....... great ! ! ! thanks so much
1	fred and josie h. will return each time we are in las vegas ! betty and larry t .
1	great food , great service ! ! ! ! we will be back !
1	all were delicious and the owners / managers , robert and joanne ( sp ? ) , are consummate hosts . intimate interior , outdoor seating in the courtyard ; what more could you ask for ? it 's great to have them in the neighborhood .
1	changed up the menu on my family and they loved it . staff was professional & courteous- kept asking me if i wanted anything to drink while i waited for my food . great food , great service = happy family
1	very friendly service and good food too ! have not had a problem at all . recommend this location .
1	love the to start out with the egg rolls . can 't go wrong w / orange chicken and chow mien .
1	i have not had a bad item yet . 6 / 5 stars will be back again .
1	food is flavourful , service excellent and space is cozy and intimate . great neighbourhood restaurant that will be on regular rotation for dinner
1	love the single tables , makes for a more intimate experience . loved everything we tried . favorites : spicy pork bulgogi , beef bulgogi , and the garlic pork belly . our service was also excellent , thank you jaenica ( spelling ? ) for your wonderful service . very personable during the dining experience . at the end , my boyfriend accidentally dropped his debit card on the side of the booth , but she and a crew member helped us retrieve the card after searching for several minutes ! extra kudos for taking the time to help : ) both got an extra tip for that . will definitely be visiting again .
1	but they were really knowledgeable about the good and drinks since i have food allergies ... love this place after my hard and crazy workout at eos ! ! ! !
1	amazing fish and chips , batter is crispy and the fish is moist . they use alaskan cod . and for a celebrity chef restaurant in vegas , it is actually very reasonably priced . will be back . service is fast . only issue is that they have limited seating . but that is easily overlooked especially with the good food , fast service and they put it in a box that you can eat while walking
1	im a huge fan of gen kbbq from california . so happy they made on in vegas . we are from north side and we made the drive all the way here . let me tell u that it is worth it ! ! ! our server lisa ! ! ! is the best . she recommended dishes to us and was very attentive and made sure our gen kbbq experience was on point ! shoutout to her and hopefully u guys will have lisa be ur server . we will be back for sure
1	great place to try different dishes ad they are all very good . service is friendly .
1	absolutely dollar for dollar 100 % the best korean food i have ever had. hole in the wall . hope you have a chance to get here before it 's to late. retiring .
1	2nd time here and ordered the seafood pancake which i had the first time and now going for the bibimbob .
1	hands down , the ali roll was our favorite . carrot top comes in second , and the sara roll for something unique and smokey . our new favorite sushi joint .
1	you can ask for the amazing garlic butter sauce on the side ( i am in love with that sauce ) . you can never go wrong with the quality of taste in their food . great job guys i 'll be coming back again and again : )
1	staff is great , food is fresh . if your thinking of sushi , don 't pass up this place .
1	very tasty. my wife got the spice level 1 and i got the level 2. perfect level of spice. customer service is very good. definitely going to be our go to spot for curry .
1	2nd time here - fast service - good service - great food - a totally unique experience and a super cool vibe - if you 've never been , check it out for sure - cough cough first date idea ( interactive ) cough cough
1	good experiences both times . first time didn 't get much direction about cooking , but tonight , the second time around our server ( jimmy , i believe ) gave cooking time instructions which we appreciated ! great food and happy hours ! spent the same amount if not less than we would have spent at an ayce place and left absolutely stuffed .
1	great portions for price so far 1st time i ordered regular chicken katsu about $ 8 for my two young kids & it was more than enough & it was ono . 2nd time had to come back to get the boba deal & ordered the mini kalua pork , bbq mix , and boba ( bogo deal when you check in ) = approx . $ 25 . cashiers both times have been pleasant . oh & i love that they have charging stations in almost every sitting area ! ! ! will be back . + gbj +
1	2nd time here great service great food great prices fast food amazing portions kinda small a bit of a language barrier could use music or tv ... just a bit too quiet for me great for a grab and go or a sit and stay
1	had the carburetor roll , tori roll , and shrimp tempura . all excellent . service was great as well .
1	this place is by far becoming one of our favorites ! good food and kristen and get crew are very attentive . love it here . our faves are the pork belly , kalbi and calamari . happy tummy
1	tonight mango fried rice with chicken and thai rice soup . both were great . last time i had the pad thai , also great . keep the good food coming , thon buri and we will keep coming back .
1	small quaint restaurant with nice restaurants and quiet background music . i love there chicken pad thai . not too sweet . lunch special is $ 6.95 and comes with a soup . my husband tried the garlic chicken and it juicy , tender , and not to garlicky . love it !
1	great food ! great drinks ! great service ! great atmosphere ! good times with good friends ! best korean bbq in town ! cant wait to come back !
1	both times it was just great . and so affordable . a nice mix of thai , vietnamese , and chinese on the menu . a real find . i wish i lived here so i could make it a regular stop . but we will make a point of visiting whenever we are in mesa .
1	great selection of proteins and toppers , very fresh . the restaurant is very clean and well kept and the " pokeologists " are very friendly and polite . if your on the 101 or the 17 and are looking for fresh and tasty poke bowls i recommend this poke bar .
1	2nd time we come here , the food is fresh and delicious , servers friendly .
1	we were very impressed with services and the food ! ! ! we found a new place and will go again the eel was the largest we have ever seen at a restaurant
1	their cucumber salad is perfect , great miso soup , philly roll , yum ! we shared beef fried rice as well which was very good . good service and great food !
1	i was thinking if the food that 's been sitting here all day is pretty good then i bet the items cooked to order must be great .. sure enough was awesome . tandoori chicken some of the best i 've had ! , chicken chili good , wing good . asked i 'll definitely be back for tandori chicken and try some veggie dishes .. place if for sure legit . also prices are very reasonable . def . check it out .
1	this time i had garlic drunken noodle . it was delish !
1	got the " surprise me " sushi roll based on reviews ... omg . they know what they 're doing . no one told us what was in it once it arrived , but that 's okay because we like everything and it was fantastic . it was fried shrimp and roe and other things i 'm not sure of . the curry kick soup was awesome but the chicken in it was nothing special . i wonder if they 'd let me sub that out next time ( or leave it out completely. doesn 't need it ! ) . fantastic service as usual . love kung foo .
1	great rolls and delicious sake . man , i wanna make sure i visit this place every time i visit vegas .
1	their menu is simple , but delicious ! i don 't ever have to worry about the taste because it 's the same at all their locations .
1	tried the schezuan chicken , lo mein ( large ) , pork fried rice and eggrolls of course . just as good this time . i spent about $ 20 and there are about 3 meals out of that . the dinner crowd was good and the buffet was very appetizing . you cannot beat $ 8.95 for a dinner buffet . you must go .
1	food it excellent . spicy beef with pakoras . done .
1	great way to try lots of different types , loved this place and will be back soon !
1	and it wasn 't just cali rolls - had many of my faves , like rainbow , dynamite , dragon & new york ! plus edamame , tempura shrimp - even dessert ! boyfriend & i picked plates off the conveyor ( cute ! ) & ate till we were full - and got out of there only $ 20 ( after beverages ) + tip . attentive service , fresh tasty affordable rolls . definitely come back when i 'm on this side of town ! eastwind , can you open a central phoenix location for hungry asu students & gov 't employees ? pretty please ? ? : )
1	# 2 tamago add bacon with a side of ' crack ' fries. get it !
1	back in college and my call center days in cebu , these 2 are few of the things that makes cebu one of the best city in the philippines .. cebu lechon is of course the best dish there but if you lived in cebu for at least a month , these 2 are definitely right next to it ... come and try these ... i haven 't even mentioned the lechon pork belly , humba , bbq pork / chicken / chicken skin , grilled pork belly and a lot more ... thank god because of this , homesickness is not that severe anymore ... lol ...
1	2 things to order- jakarta fried rice and hot and spicy chicken .
1	great food very extensive menu . highly recommend . even vegetarians have good sushi options . tofu skin roll for vegetarians is a must try . best sushi restaurant thus far
1	service can be slow when they are busy , but the hot appetizers arrive quickly and when the sushi arrives , it is well worth the wait . we ate over $ 200 in sushi between the 3 of us at $ 28 each . the food more than makes up for any occasional neglect by the wait staff .
1	different ! ! great prime time ? ( lunch ) regular cook ? who knows ? best of it 's kind ! ! ! !
1	you get a mini burger , sushi , and a side of fries . the best of both worlds ! everything i 've had here has been delicious , though . the only downfall ... there is always a wait . you know the food is good for it to be consistently busy , but it makes it hard to get in there to try if you don 't feel like waiting a minimum 45-60 minutes .
1	that 's all i am going to say besides everything else is excellent ; menu , service , and decor .
1	i have been here over 10 x and i have never had a complaint . the food is fresh , flavorful and reasonably priced ... you cant go wrong . will i be going back ? yes , 100 %
1	the food is really good but let 's be honest i go for their dessert !
1	best in town ! ! ! ! i love this place , i love the seating and customer service ! the sushi has never been bad here and ive always been in a great full mood when we leave .
1	the food , the service , a great price and quality !
1	fried chicken + 5 spice pork belly ( plus toppings ) on a pillowy soft bao ... this location being a 2 minute walk from home is so great ! marshall 's , bed bath and beyond and now bahn mi boys ... yonge and gerrard is getting better by the day ! if you like more bread than meat go for a bahn mi sandwich , but if you are like me , and are all about the meat - he he - get a bao !
1	sushi is great as well. fish is very fresh .
1	yum yum i havent met a rays that i dont like , and thats a scientific fact .
1	the best part about living there was the food ! i know it may not be pc but i love the thai food in toronto more than thailand ( feel free to judge me ) . pai is hands down the best thai food i 've ever had ( for a really long time sukho was tops for me but i think pai beats sukho . ) if you have out of town friends - this is the place to take them ! !
1	the food is amazing ! coming from an asian country , i would say this is a restaurant with good food . we ate the bbq pork , tofu as well as chicken . services is still slightly above average but the food says it all
1	2 years have passed since my first review and i must say that the food , cleanliness , and staff remain top notch !
1	this place is just as good as it was before but it has expanded ! this food is so great - the chicken and pork cutlets are so perfect ( perfect amount of fat in the meat , perfect panko breading and fried perfectly ) . the curry is so good and the price so reasonable . i 'm glad they expanded to allow for more people to eat this delicious food . i 'll return here every time i come to vegas .
1	nothing beats this at 2 am . from duck to chicken and spice it 's good . se you 2018
1	the set meals are pretty good value as well . buns are the best i 've found in montreal so far . remember to use the spicy oil and black vinegar to season the cold plates and buns . wontons are delicious as they use sesame oil to enhance the aroma . service is kinda like a self-serve thing . so don 't hold yourself back from grabbing spoons , chopstick , napkins from wherever u find them . no one really comes here for the service anyways so you can forget about it .
1	open till 2am . if you 're from a major city i don 't need to say any more about " hole in the walls " or street vendors making the best food . you get it , you understand . go here . get one . actually , get two . grab a beer from qt on the corner , go home , and grub . you 're welcome . to the three reviewers who sent me here : thank you : ) to the woman and man running this establishment : bless your hearts . you give nyc and chicago hot dogs a run for their money !
1	tried the spicy mexican which was pretty delicious because it has a squirt of sriracha on each piece and i love me some sriracha . sushi chef was a sweetheart . place closed at 11pm . late saturday night meal for us . hit the spot .
1	lunch general taos chicken was 5.95 and all white meat ! thats right all white and fresh baby corn , broccoli and red and green bell peppers . the sauce was absolutely perfect . just enough sweet and heat to be out of this world . needless to say i will never eat general 's chicken any where else . they also have sushi that i cannot wait to try . do yourself a favor and try the
1	my favorite vietnamese place ! i enjoyed another huge bowl of bun ( my fave ) . this time it was no . 46 with grilled chicken and pork spring roll but i also enjoy the one with grilled beef . my dinner companions also tucked into huge steaming bowls of beef pho and tofu veggie dishes . we had a round of shrimp and veggie summer rolls in rice paper . washed it down with " 33 " expo vietnamese beer too . siagon palace never disappoints ! huge and savory portions that are " almost " too pretty to eat . i never have left overs ! a great south charlotte destination for a taste of vietnam !
1	it had little chopped up cucumbers under the noodles that were yummy . crispy spring rolls delicious . first time here & really enjoyed it !
1	couldnt find better cantonese style wonton noodle elsewhere in north america .
1	i recommend sharing an order of pork belly buns and veggy dumplings and getting your own bowl of miso raman with smoked tofu . sit outside if the weather allows and watch people on willy st .
1	the bowl was amazing . plenty of chicken with the right amount of sauce . and the sauce had good flavor . the rice was good too which is rare . the egg roll and 3 piece gyoza were $ 1.50 each and both done nicely . the sauce that came to dip was gross tho . but i usually just eat them without sauce . also got a 4 piece ca roll for $ 2.30 . although good not as good sushi as ichi bowl . i 'll likely be back at least for the chicken . service was good and quick .
1	definitely recommended for those coming from a good pump at the gym .
1	the thai tea is also amazing ! ! yes the place is usually not full , but don 't let that scare you . love this place .
1	the best value i know of in pittsburgh and one of the tastiest things i can think of eating . love that stuff and get it every time i 'm in pitt early enough to make it to the strip district . they have a little table outside you can sit and eat at as well . the grocery store is alright , but i have no clue what most the stuff in there is , i always just go for the chicken .
1	can 't get enough ! just the way i like my katsu . mmmm sooooooo goooood : )
1	once you take a bite of the sandwich you won 't stop . i would make this my go to if it was a bit closer but if need by ill make the drive .
1	great service and great food . it is now going to be our go to for take home .
1	this is only dim sum place i go in las vegas .
1	the crunch roll and green salads were really good as well . we will definitely be back !
1	i 've got the place to myself , so it 's nice and quiet . food is awesome . can 't beat it. better than the other options today .
1	fresh ingredients and great flavor abound . i will be back .
1	i love the food and service was great . i love the the intimacy of this place as it is much smaller than their other locations . although it is inside the hard hotel , once inside- you forget that you are in the middle of a casino . i am looking forward to going back .
1	service and food quality is always on point ! today i ordered the salmon , yellowtail , blue fin ( recommended by the server ) , and uni sashimi ! all were delicious ! the chef also gave us a special on the house corn egg shooter which totally blew me away ! the place is always clean and friendly ! i will definitely be back ! thank you hiroba !
1	3rd time here and food is fresh and service from ella the best ... had goyza and egg rolls ... california roll and jalapeno roll ... all 5 stars
1	the orange chicken is the best i 've ever had . honey walnut shrimp is out of this world . service is frindly and genuine . i 'll continue to eat here .
1	love that they have all you can eat ( that 's a deal breaker for my bf when eating sushi ) service was great the manager and sushi chefs are all so nice ! perfect neighborhood sushi spot : )
1	love this place . food : awesome you also get to pick your spice level ! ok for all types of eaters . if you want to try curry but don 't want the spice this is the place to check out .
1	its so good ! this time i visited there during lunch . even better . no lines , food came in fast . since this is an all you can eat restaurant , you will not worrying about " left over fish " issues like other a la carte sushi ( yes , in japanese culture you may get to eat the fish from the day before during lunch ) . everything is fresh and their fried stuffs are actually quite yummy ( shrimp tempura , fried shumai ) . ahi poke salad is good too . i didn 't like the grilled yellowtail cheek too much . make sure to save rooms for desserts ! yummy lychee ice creams !
1	great chef ! friendly atmosphere , very clean , small , family oriented . the only downer is that they don 't serve alcohol . sapporo would be nice with the pad thai = )
1	3 stars is laughable ... this place makes the best chinese food in phoenix and its a buffet which is the crazy part , don 't listen to the reviews foods phenomenal ! !
1	pat is one of the few people in this world who really enjoys being good at what he does . i asked him , " how long " and with much joy he replied , " i can get your food in 10-15 minutes . " sure enough it took 9 minutes . i value time and in my business my word is everything . pat understands this and when i eat here again i will insist on his table . i recommend you do the same . ask for pat ! ! ! top notch pat . don 't ever change .
1	com 'on ... when you enter an asian restaurant and you are the only western ... 2 options : food is gonna be really weird so be ready or it is a hidden gem ... in this case second option hands down . just look the pic and take your conclusion . amaaaaaziiing ! ! ! cheap and super authentic . sorry first option too ... i ordered the dessert ... sweet lotus seed with white fungus . made of a white fungus that grows in trees . what an amazing place ! ! ! delicious . still the only western , been here for an hour now .
1	3 $ sushi .... awesome instead of ordering all you can ... this is a good way of trying a lot with very very cheap price ... if u are interested in all u can eat for lunch it 's $ 20.95 and for dinner it 's 25.95 ... or else you can just order whatever u want they have really good cucumber salad .. love it ...
1	first my honey ordered me the chicken pad thai and i can almost say was the best i 've had yet ! 2nd visit we ordered crispy garlic chicken and yellow curry wig chicken and i was so amazed ! the crispy garlic chicken is to die for . i 'm not an experienced curry eater but the sauce was good and the potatoes added a nice touch . the staff is friendly and the place is clean . little hole in the walls always make the best food , but u wouldn 't exactly call it a hole in the wall , it 's just that it 's in such a odd place ! but i 'm sure they make a killing mon-fri .
1	i am not a sushi eater but here i eat sushi ! its that good . i love how everyone takes pride in the food the serve even the young teen who took our order . he did a fist pump when we said the food was awesome ! he also recommended other dishes for the future which sound delicious but the mango sweet dish will always be my favorite ! !
1	i have had both the basil chicken and the garlic pepper chicken . they are both super tasty . if you like spicy i would go hot over medium . all of their meat and veggie are very fresh . service is good and to-go orders are very fast . the place is small and cute inside . best part , they have brown rice ! yummy . this place is a must try !
1	pricey but delicious . the crab legs were absolutely amazing ! unlimited , pre-cut and decent sizes . the sushi was limited but also very good . there were clams , shrimp and other seafood delights available as well . and they have ribs and steaks for meat lovers . the dessert was pretty bad though . a huge variety of garbage . if seafood doesn 't interest you , i probably wouldn 't suggest eating here . 12.99 for unlimited drink package
1	this place is awesome . great food but if ur looking for ambiance then this wont work for you .
1	there 's like 4 people here ... i ordered the barbecue chicken bowl with brown rice , carrots , broccoli & peas . yummy for under $ 6 . i asked for no soy sauce . it looked delicious on the flyer . was very impressed with the flavor . i 'd return no problem . wish we had one of these chains at rhodes ranch town center at durango and warm springs .. the drive was worth it .
1	service was excellent . place was clean and had a very nice decor and seating was not crowded . prices were reasonable ( 3 of us ate and the bill was $ 75 ) and we tried many dishes and left full . some of the best crab and shrimp i 've eaten . i really liked this place and plan on returning soon . it 's located on the southeast corner of sahara and lindell . big enough to handle large crowds but you still get personalized attention .
1	we ordered at home and did the pickup option instead of dining in . the food was ready when we got there , which was pretty fast considering it took us 15 minutes to get down to pho . the food was delicious , just what i needed to curb my pho cravings
1	the service is amazing , and the food is , too . the smoothies were really fruity , and the pho tasted amazing . we will definitely be back . the menu is really reasonably priced , too !
1	" hidden gem with awesome food ! one of my favorite places for pho ! my husband now wants it on a regular rotation ! plus , the macaroon ice cream sandwiches are heaven ! ! ! makes my inner # foodie very happy ! ! the family that owns this place are very down to earth ! it 's like going to dinner at a friend 's house ! love this place !
1	i come here for that every time . it is s metal bowl with rice around the inside and cooked to be crispy . then they add a stir fry meat and veg on top of that . if is very good . i think the thing that makes it better than most is the sauce . i would normally call it a white sauce similar to moo goo gi pan , but it is lighter than that . i 'm not sure what the 68 means but i 'm guessing it 's because it 's not as good as 69
1	# 21 , # 26 , # 36 ( or was that # 32 ? ) , and let 's not forget the cafe sua da . over the years i 've eaten at most of the vietnamese restaurants in phoenix and in the end i 've always come back to da vang .
1	just tried the tofu khao soi today . the bowl didn 't look big but it was sure very filling ! i finished eating just before 2 : 30pm ( when they close for their break ) . someone else walked in and they seated him for dine-in anyway . kudos to awesome customer service ! also very clean : )
1	i love udon dishes and this is one of my all-time favourites . chicken and waffles - good portion size . chicken was cooked wonderfully , was not dry at all , and tasted slightly asian somehow . waffles were good but i would have preferred them to be more crunchy . i thought the berry sauce was unique and tasty . the food is high quality and reasonably priced . i will keep coming back !
1	especially if you share some of the sushi rolls . i 've been twice now and everyone has left full & happy . fair pricing and good presentation .
1	just landed in toronto , and needed a quick dinner before settling into the city . the fast food joint was only 15 minutes away from the airport , so we decided to come here . the fried chicken was super good ! ! not the best fried chicken i 've had , but it 's up there on the list . we also ordered the b.b.q pork fried rice , really flavorful and greasy . everything we had was total yum ! would definitely recommend if you love eating chicken ! and yes , i would come back if i lived in the area ! ! cheap , quick and good , what more can you ask for ! ! plus they serve beeeerrr !
1	washrooms are clean . yay food was delicious yay portions were huge yay prices were cheap ( and some surprising specials ) yay the best are the late lunch specials : d i usually end up with enough food to pack home for dinner ... which is a huge plus !
1	this was some of the best thai food i 've ever had . ordered pad thai with chicken , drunken noodles with beef and garlic prawns . everything was delicious ! ! ! we will definitely be back and will try other things in the menu .
1	my favorite pho restaurant in the phoenix metropolitan area . i went to college at asu , so i used to frequent this place at least once a week . i 've had everything from their noodles - pho tai , bun rieu , bun bo hue , to their lunch specials - orange chicken , fried rice , etc and can 't say i 've ever been disappointed . their soup for all their noodle dishes are very flavorful and well-portioned.i used to come here so often the owner would just ask - " the usual ? " khai hoan definitely has a special place in my heart : )
1	it 's hard to beat this place in terms of value . portions are very generous , prices are cheap and the food is delicious . food is not too salty or oily . i 've already gone twice since the opening . it 's that good ! .
1	great restaurant ! the outside is a little funky and the interior is not fancy at all . however the food is fantastic ! very authentic thai food . we had spring rolls which were crisp and delicious . pineapple fried rice and drunken noodles with prawns which was absolutely fantastic ! again this is not a high end experience restaurant just a gem off the strip with really good thai food that is reasonably priced .
1	my review is based on several visits during lunch . my impression : this is the best chinese restaurant i 've tried in my 8 years of living in phoenix . originally from seattle , i 've had my share of chinese food . this place is very good ! i 'm very impressed . love the egg drop soup . the fried rice needs a little more veggies / eggs , but overall had a good flavor . the chicken they use is very good quality . my whole family really enjoyed this place . not sure why so many low reviews on here . i 'm quite confused ...
1	first i have to tell you guys to not book on open table . because i ended up booking the one in new york. so please book on yelp anyways , the food was so good . the aesthetic is extremely on point and really really beautiful . every single dish is carefully hand crafted . from their royal dumpling platter with natural colours and exuberant flavour ranging from sweet to savoury to their extra tender gaeng boombai naeng , every plate was perfect . the service here is polite , friendly and attentive . they give great recommendations and are very genuine and take great care of you . easily one of my most memorable meals with my honey !
1	i 've only been here for takeout and i like everything i 've tried so far . i usually get the chasu don with extra pork ( $ 4.50 + 3.00 extra ) and it is filling and satisfying . also tried their karage and croquettes ... fried chicken is nothing to write home about , it tastes the same at all ramen joints and croquettes were just okay . they have a great dessert menu which includes mille crepes and cream puffs ! the best . management / staff is super friendly , courteous and genuine .
1	one of the best thai places i 've eaten at . i can 't wait to try more . the sun-dried beef was crispy and flavorful , but i was a little disappointed by the quantity . i also got the kao soi . it was smooth and flavorful . it was a little sweet following the beef dish , but i really enjoyed it . and i really appreciated all the ingredients / toppings . i did add some extra spice . i can 't wait to try more dishes from this place ! ! and barley pop next door is an added bonus .
1	i was in town last week and the line was out the door all night ! this week ( tuesday ) i caught a short line , but if you are one or two only you can eat at the bar without waiting . if you want a date night , make a reservation . the bartender told me for friday and saturday they are booked a month in advance . i had the pad thai noodles ( of course ) and they were awesome . i paired it with a ransack the universe by # collectiveartsbrewery and they were yummy together . beware though , if you ask for the noodles " spicy " they are spicy !
1	butter chicken and rice with paneer pakora are favorites . especially the paneer and dipping sauces ... top notch . salivating just thinking about it . service is always friendly and pretty fast . when i call in takeout it 's always ready when i get there . for the portion size and venue , i think the prices are a bit steep ( close to $ 30 for the chicken and paneer ) , so add bread and drinks , and you 're looking at $ 40-50 a person . that 's why i eat there once every 2 months instead of more often , even though it 's the best indian food on this side of town .
1	the ayam chicken was cooked in a red curry sauce that reminded me of an indian curry and thai panang curry combination with less coconut milk . the sauce on the ayam had a hint of sweet and just the right amount of spicy . this is a really good find and i can 't wait to try out the rest of the menu .
1	this is best buffet in vegas ! had to see what 17 million dollars worth of renovations does to a buffet and all i can say is wow . we had lunch there on a weekday and it wasn 't very crowded . i suggest : ginseng chicken , oysters , menudo , and freshly made crepes . sushi selection could use some work , but i 've yet to have really good sushi at any buffet . service was great . dirty plates promptly removed . we found a live baby crab inside one of the oysters . was a little disturbing since it was moving around , but i guess that means it 's very fresh .
1	this place is fantastic ... the food is great and the guys at the hibachi are courteous and highly entertaining . great stop for lunch too if you 're in the mood for asian or sushi . great drinks , great atmosphere . fantastic for large dinner groups too . it 's not so tough on the wallet either , considering all that you are getting ... the soups are delicious and the portion sizes are very generous . this is about as good as it gets as far as hibachi places go .
1	service was really quick as well ! i like the layout of the restaurant too - unlike kinton ramen , the seats are actually semi-comfortable and you don 't have to worry as much about bringing in too many belongings with you . you still have the same modern , ramen-shop vibe at sansotei minus the uncomfortable seats . the only downsides are the small size of the restaurant and the fact that you can 't see the chefs preparing your ramen .
1	very great lunch specials , and the food is pretty tasty . the only reason it doesn 't get a full 5 stars is because i think their pad thai is a bit bland . vegetable tempura for lunch is great , and they even give you a small desert with lunch special , really great deal .
1	a bit small , but very clean with extremely friendly staff , fast service , and kitchen is visible from the tables . food was fresh ; we tried the dumplings appetizer and i got pineapple fried rice with 6-heat . my wife had the shrimp pad thai with 8- heat . while delicious , the heat levels were a bit mild so don 't be afraid to go 10 if you want it spicy ! we 'll def go back - best thai i 've had so far in the south hills !
1	would have been 5 stars , except i wasn 't thrilled with the pad thai , which is the quintessential thai dish ... but omg the panang curry beef and the yellow curry chicken and the thai fried rice were epic . epic . epic ! ! ! ( and there isn 't much in the culinary universe better than fried rice , right ? ) great thai iced tea and iced coffee , too . everything i 've tried other than the pad thai is 5 star !
1	rio seafood buffet . it was freaking awesome ! we took the free shuttle from paris to rio . it was a quick 15 min-ish ride . the rider was pretty cool too . we walked towards the seafood buffet , and rio has a live show in the ceiling ! that was very cool too ! but onto the buffet ... there were a lot of different dishes , and the food was excellent . i stayed at the hot seafood side , and they had this lobster dish that was to-die-for ! i would highly recommend this buffet if you are ever in vegas ! come early , or prepare to wait in line . a tad expensive though ... but it 's vegas .
1	great value , good food . and the service was better other have mentioned .
1	standard chinese food and the green beans are good . they do have vegetarian egg food young which is good . if you want cheap and convenient food then go to lotus buffet .
1	i always order a full order of potato dumplings with the works and basically submerge the pel 'meni in their awesome sweet chili sauce . the sour cream is the perfect side ! not to mention the employees are almost always extremely friendly . i recommend this little place to anyone . 5 stars all the way .
1	everything that the others rave about is true . the baguettes here are chewy and fresh , the meat is savory , the vegetables are crispy and bright . these things combine to make a tasty treat that is simply sublime . about once a week , someone at the office has a craving . . . we dispatch a volunteer and spend the afternoon rejoicing over the experience . i just returned as an envoy to what i affectionally refer to as " little saigon " with eleven # 6s , 3 with peppers . ; ) nomnomnomnomnomnomnom !
1	sooo much good food : ) we were visiting and found this place of yelp and it was great choice
1	walnut shrimp , mongolian beef , cashew chicken , and shrimp curry . all excellent . bottle beer cheap . not much for looks but great food and service . outside of downtown vegas .
1	$ 4 for lunch that 's absolutely delicious ? yes please !
1	well priced , extremely fast , and amazingly delicious food . this has been the saving grace of sick days and busy weeknights were my lovely wifey turns into a food rage monster can only be satiated by a tasty firestorm of pho . here 's looking at your sav r ; ) if you don 't like pho , it is because you have a problem with yourself remember , if you over do it with the sriacha ..... it is my divine intervention . the furry of the chile gods is testing you to become a stronger person . persevere . stay strong .
1	we ordered a bit not al la caret and it worked out really well . great food !
1	stefanie , our server was great . loved the hot & sour soup , egg rolls & lettuce wraps . we all had different entrees and we all had smiles on our faces .
1	great great ramen ! ! loved the spicy one ! everyone at the table loved their soup ! def coming back ! !
1	4 out of 5 times , masa sushi is our go to place , we like to experience different places , to add to our favorites , but masa remains our favorite .
1	$ 40 well spent . don 't be worried that their online menu only has like 15 rolls on it . inside you are given 3 different sushi menus , all with tons of options . favorites were the volcano and wasabi tuna . cheap , quality sushi !
1	love their garlic chicken wings , the mount charleston and all you can menu . i 've taken different friends and family here and they all love it as well . sorry to see the downtown location closed , it 's definitely a favorite place of mine to eat !
1	this is a 5 star place ! ! ! ! the ambiance , quality of food , and prices are unbelievable ! ! ! ! better than high end places in downtown las vegas
1	( you would never have guessed this from the store front . 5 stars for food . some thai restaurants load up on sugar and chilli . pete 's doesn 't and portion sizes are more than generous . 5 stars for value . ( this would be a 6 if possible ) 5 stars for service . robert is very friendly and has good recommendations . roa - ratio of authenticity ( # ethnic patrons / # total patrons ) = 40 % . this is after three separate visits . won 't be disappointed . diamond in the rough .
1	this place is perfectly affordable and it doesn 't limit you to food such as pizza for their price . if you are ever sick of eating hotel food and don 't want to spend a big buck either for something yummy , please try this place out . super hole in the wall place , but my boyfriend and are from orange county and we frequent this place every time we 're here . they have sandwiches to thai food ! i always get the pad thai with chicken . level spicy 7 ; ) my boyfriend gets spicy lvl 12 ; ) . trust me they will make your food spicy as long as you ask or it ! four thumbs up !
1	this place is a must to everyone who loves south asian food and culture . usually a few min wait time , so i suggest walking around and exploring the area a bit . make sure you get the kabobs !
1	i went in for a take-out , and they served me with a sushi piece and edamame to try out . i ordered the sushi bento box for $ 15 including tax - the volume was so large i almost couldn 't finish it . it came with ; rice & beef short ribs ( which almost amounts to a full meal ) 5 pieces of tempura 3 fried dumplings 6 pieces of sushi salad miso soup the service was amazing too - recommended for all hungry people !
1	for a small buffet it had great variety , i particularly liked the goat curry and sweet rice . what really made my visit great was the owner . he was constantly attending to all the tables , providing refills on water and asking his guests how their meals tasted . attentive and kind , while providing great food , earns 5 stars in my book !
1	4 stars for the food and another star for the terrific staff the butter squid , tsuki salad , and seafood pancake were very good the portions are more than generous the staff was helpful , friendly and very professional i mentioned that i was staying at hotel nearby and was told that they offer a 10 % discount to the hotel guests
1	4 stars for yumminess and 1 for value. i think i 've made at least 1 stop at ichiza in 9 of my last 10 trips to vegas. don 't order from the menu - order off the wall !
1	i 've had stir fries ( phad kaprow , phad prik sod ) , green curry , and pad thai . my husband likes the pineapple fried rice . all have been good and satisfying . this is my go-to place in the glendale , az area . spicy noodles = drunken noodles
1	i like fried noodle and noodle soup , my husband really like the starter peanuts and veggie , our friend likes here too : ) staff there are really nice and friendly
1	this place is clean , service is attentive , menu is huge , and the food is very good . the prices are ultra competitive and , unlike other pho places , they have music playing . they noticed me now that i 've come in a few times and they treat me like a vip . best pho in town ! ! !
1	it was really crowded yesterday but the waiting time for a table was short . service was really fast as usual . there were no order mix-ups . going for lunch is the best minus the fact that you don 't get any sashimi . if you 're going to get sushi , i highly recommend the dynamite roll , green and black dragon roll . their chicken teriyaki and squid tempura was also very delicious . otherwise , the food was up to par , better than most ayce places .
1	the moo satae is the best ! chicken and spicy plum sauce was very good
1	the food is awesome and the service . no doubt the best japanese restaurant ichiban !
1	that 's the way to go . being that i 'm not from here , i was surprised at how fresh the sushi was . but it was ! we ordered way too much but somehow found a way to finish it all . i would definitely come back .
1	this hidden gem will change your life . awesome atmosphere , awesome servers , awesome music , we always bbq our food and the soju is legit . if you have group , rent out the karaoke room .
1	by now , i 've experimented with most items on the menu and they 're always consistently made and you can expect the same when you order again . service is very friendly as well . overall , a very good family establishment !
1	first time here and this place is delish and the service is great . jose was awesome ! ! the citrus chicken & veggie noodles were my favorite .
1	i ordered on eat24 , the food showed up piping hot and 10 minutes ahead of the quoted time . my girlfriend and i shared crab rangoons , pork lo mein , and had an entree portion of kung pao and general tso 's chicken . portion sizes are awesome ( their gen . tso is enough to feed two people , and i eat a lot ) , especially for the price . we will be getting pearl wok again soon .
1	beautifully decorated dark interior custom painted murals on the walls beautiful artwork everywhere . my friend and i went on a monday evening they were a little slow chef was kind enough to prepare us a delicious and elegantly presentation of high quality sashimi , sushi , 2 pieces of grilled fish atop vegetables a pink lady roll , and the best battered shrimp i have ever had . dessert was a generous slice of strawberry champagne cake . if you live on the north side of town you need to try umami i live 40 miles away and will certainly be back . thank you chef kim for the wonderful evening .
1	the food is prepared and served quickly . the pricing is reasonable .
1	the price was great . $ 5.99 for a combo meal and over the weekday , it 's $ 2 off ! wished i had more eggs but for the price , i don 't really care . it was a cute restaurant and i will probably come back again
1	i had passed by many times before , but never bothered to try it . my good friend introduced me to this place , and i have been back repeatedly since ! friendly , beautiful staff , and awesome food ! the minced beef and fried egg is excellent ( super huge portion , and i usually finish my plates clean ! ) . and you have to try the beef medallion ! the chrysanthemum tea is a nice , sweet balance to your meal . the only downside is the pricing , which can be expected since it 's located inside a casino . i 'd still say it ranks in my top 5 chinese restaurants in las vegas . a must try !
1	the best seafood soup i have had ... and i 've had a bunch ! service was good , place is nice , but most importantly , that soup was delicious !
1	the 2 and 3 star reviews are sick . its the perfect quick cheap chinese take out . service is friendly local family oriented . better than panda or any other fast food chinese straight up .
1	thank you for accomodating my special request and thank you for a memorable night and meal ! !
1	i 've never had such variety in side dishes , and my companion tells me that they change it up very often . most places serve only 5 side dishes , this place does 7 ! too bad you can only refill up to 3 side dishes , but with the high quality it makes sense . i disagree with the other person who mentioned that people think makkal chon is great only because there isn 't really other korean food in this area . i 've eaten korean all over toronto and this is definitely one of the better spots for it . bulgogi was tender and well flavoured , my companion really enjoys the pork gamja tang . side dishes are the bomb .
1	ive had the roasted duck , wonton soup , roasted pork bbq , roasted duck and wonton soup . all were awesome and so so tasty ! i recommend adding some hot sauce from the containers on the side . made my food even better ! 5 / 5 price ! the soup was like $ 9 bucks and seriously if i wasn 't such a pig that could feed 2 people . cash only 3 / 5 service eh .. its what you get for a chinese restaurant , they had better service then a normal chinese restaurant all in all if i want to take my parents here you know its a good spot to be at , why aren 't you here yet .
1	food was delicious and the ingredients so fresh . it had an hour wait but they took our name and sent us a sms when the table was ready . service was fast and courteous . ambience is great ! very good experience ! the only thing i would have liked is more chicken in my pad thai .
1	food , service , quality and price . i could eat this at anytime and my personal fav is the friend chicken bao , and pork belly bao and all the banh mi sandwiches . kalbi beef tacos are also amazing . pro tip : gets busy during rush hour , and be prepared to have itis for the rest of your day : )
1	you can never go wrong with the chicken teriyaki bowl .
1	i would say it 's quite pricey , especially because its a la carte ( you could pay a few dollars more somewhere else for ayce ) , but i think it 's well worth it . the portion sizes are just enough ( vs. stuffing your face at an all you can eat , and feeling guilty / sick afterwards ) . i 've only been for dinner but would like to see if they have a lunch menu with specials .
1	excellent service along with a great atmosphere ... typically i find it hard expressing certain needs bc of a language barrier ... but shiki gets it ! and might i add that they serve the best teriyaki chicken in town ; )
1	variety of options of healthy & delicious meals for my super busy on the go lifestyle ! great staff and a super convenient location in ahwatukee . thx much ! ! ; ) -e . mclaurin
1	what a steal ! the portions are quite huge for a lunch time deal ! i ate all of mine of course . service is attentive and good . endless refills of water for me in this hot weather !
1	they have the best sweet and sour chicken , beating any other restaurant i 've eaten in ( including chinatown in san francisco . i have been here twice and the service is great . i like refills on my drink and was always taken care of promptly .
1	you can 't beat it i give it five stars because the service was prompt , my take-out order took no more than 5 min ( as promised , even though the restaurant looked busy ) , and the food was good . it 's hard to mess up chinese food but they did a good job and gave big portions .
1	this family run joint is amazing , don 't be fooled by the lack of patrons or the divey feel , this place serves class and amazing thai food . they are super veggie friendly and everything i ate was amazing ( thai spicy eggplant with spring roll , soup and dessert ) . if you are in spadina china town and feeling a bit peckish , stop by this place and you will not be disappointed . and if for some reason you are , then it won 't hurt your wallet , so don 't fret .
1	this was such a nice surprise to find . the chicken in the kung pao was juicy and delicious . the chicken in the lettuce wraps was fantastic as well . i love the cool lettuce with spicy chicken combo . i recommend upgrading to fried rice with your entree .
1	they jam pack the box with food ! you get to pick one rice , one meat , and three veggies from a variety of options . one of the servers told me that their mutton curry is the spiciest , so if you like spicy food , give that a try ! i 've been here several times and have never ran into any problems with the food or service . they always have a handful of staff on hand - both at the counter and at the cash . samosas are four for a dollar ! ! p.s. this place is takeout only , so there is no seating .
1	service was friendly and food was filling . price was acceptable . i 'd go again . 24hrs a day ... can 't beat that
1	you betcha . it was great as well . i 'll definitely be coming back . friendly staff that kept my water glass full .
1	if you like it spicy , you can get the dynamite chicken bowl !
1	i repeat x100 ! on our last vegas trip , i was craving for some hainan chicken rice and so we decided to check this place out . we ordered a plate of hainan chicken with a bowl of rice along with stir-fry bok choy . the hainan chicken is enough to feed 2 people . the bok choy was really yummy too . i highly recommend it ! the place is off the strip , but the food here is delicious and super cheap and affordable . i 'd definitely come here again .
1	5hisbus my favourite place to stop for something to eat when i 'm traveling back from somewhere ... too far to go home and i 'm starving ( since airplane food just doesn 't cut it ) - the gyoza us delicious and i love the sushi - ya bento !
1	if you 're one to want to try new things , head to south end for a variety of good trucks and great people watching . the area tends to get crowded after 7 : 30 , so plan accordingly . make sure to bring cash ! it 's a great date night option or something fun to do on the first weekend of the month .
1	really terrific daily bibimbap specials and terrific rice cake ! to top it all off great service ! and yummy unique side dishes . we love it here . been here since 2013 . on site manager is great , always treats us well !
1	this is definitely our favorite sushi hangout . the staff is always happy and make us feel like we 're hanging out at a sushi version of cheers ! and if the the staff isn 't enough to win you over , the food will amaze you ! awesome happy hour specials ! thank you , once again , for making our experience a special one .
1	we had a wonderful time . the drinks were a good price and so were the appetizers . they started us off with yummy egg drop soup and wonton chips as soon as we sat down . can 't beat that ! the nam sod chicken salad was so delicious and flavorful . i 'd have it again ! we also had the satay chicken and beef . the dipping sauce was good . the owners were very nice and friendly . the place looks great . next time , i 'll definitely have to sit at the lovely bar . recommended !
1	definitely one of the best sushi places in toronto ! fish is fresh and service is great ! byod adds a unique touch ! i recommend most of the rolls , including vegetarian options ! ! $ $
1	$ 2.50 per bun including tax . enough said . their salad rolls are pricey at $ 4-5 for a pack of 4 but they are very yummy with the sauces provided . totally recommend . spring rolls however are nothing to write home about . they were bland with too much cabbage and didn 't come with any dipping sauce . i think they are around $ 1-1.20 .
1	fantastic service and the price was super affordable with a great portion for the price ! will gladly return here to eat !
1	every dish was presented beautifully and with every bite , you could tell it was fresh-definitely no " fishy " taste with their seafood . the staff is very knowledgeable and have great recommendations such as the sashimi platter , white peach sake , yellowtail yuzu soy and hydro bibb black cod . if you don 't like sashimi , try their grilled salmon or beef tadas . i will be coming back to try the rest of the things on the menu : )
1	the menu is ginormous with so much to chose from for all you can eat ! also the service was so fast i couldn 't even raise my head without the waiter asking me if i wanted anything else ! it was amazing . everyone has to come here 100 %
1	got a small booth . 3 orders of wings , edamame , pho , and green curry . everything on point including our server . 1 / 2 price bottle of wine and total cost $ in my opinion . $ 62 yes please ! ! !
1	saturday eve , busy as hell on the strip and additional sitting on the patio resulted crowded feeling . thumbs up to servers maneuvering between the tight space . nice place to people watch , but not exactly romantic until sun goes down and bellagio fountain light up , people start to migrate into clubs and casino . food is divine , service attentive , price affordable , comfortable atmosphere .. first time i tried stingray , fantastic . deliciously seasoned salmon . luv their cappuccino . if this place was off of strip , i would come here every month .
1	the ingredients are fresh , the staff is friendly , and the restaurant is clean . the won-ton soup is by far the best ( and freshest ) i have ever had . i will advise , i love " hot " and i can 't handle 5 r cha 's " 5 . " they definitely add more heat than most places , which is fine , it 's thai food , but just a warning to those who don 't like things hot .
1	we went in for lunch it is $ 11.99 per person . i feel they had an amazing selection for a buffet and if you love sashimi and california rolls this is the place for you. it will wow you with their selection . i cannot wait to try them for dinner
1	one of my top 3 meals this year . sushi is fresh and inventive . no cream cheese rolls here . we had an indian-inspired roll over a yogurt curry sauce and fought over the last piece . the kitchen specialties are pricey but completely worth it . roasted scallop , langoustine and snapper over saffron scallop stock and parsley cream was the best thing i 've had in my mouth in quite a while . soups , tea and sake are also fantastic . sleek , calming nature-inspired decor with cozy , ( fake ) furry-backed chairs . perfection . a sante ~
1	come here for good quick food , and relatively cheap . not a restaurant , more like fast food .
1	from the friendly voice on the other end of my phone order to the flavor of each dish . i got the kentucky fried fish while my husband got the pork . the pho-king egg was my side that i put on my fish . yum ! ! ! ! it will be hard to order anything else .
1	customer service was unbelievable . food was amazing and price was cheap . my husband and i will be back very soon .
1	upscale asian fusion restaurant with gorgeous decoration and impressive food . the best chinese fusion meal i have ever had . dim sum taste amazing but more healthy . recommend special marinated pork and premium braised fin lo fun . the restaurant redefine the chinese food . good quality , good taste and healthy . 5 star .
1	i have never dined in , but have gotten delicious takeout from best wok several times over the last few months . the meat is high quality ( always white meat chicken ) , the veggies are fresh and not overcooked & you can ask for no msg in your dishes . takeout is ready on time - they are usually bagging it up as soon as you walk in the door . it 's usually busy , so i know there 's a large following . oh and if you 're trying to go to new zealand but don 't want to wait an hour , hop in to best wok instead !
1	simple , fresh , flavorful , fast chinese takeout that 's fairly close to my house and isn 't expensive . been looking for a good chinese takeout place since we moved here last year . this is it .
1	fresh , tasty greens . sweet , succulent dishes . fresh , firm noodles . great service too .
1	definitely the best quality you can ever get with such a cheap price . the owner is so nice ! ! ! my friend and i visited once after their business hour . she still let us in and served us freshly made kimchi side dishes ! !
1	the sushi was unreal and so was the service . i was very impressed once i walked in to when i left . i will be back with friends !
1	attended the 22nd asian festival in scottsdale this morning and found multiple food trucks and white food tents to dine from . i chose flippin rice , first impressed with their huge black truck and their colorful menu . i ordered # 7 which consisted of 4 shrimp and pork lumpia with white rice , dipping sauce , and shredded salad and i added an extra ( only $ 1 each ) two lumpia to it , spent only nine bucks . wonderful flavor and visual presentation made you want to eat more than you could ! i will look them up in gilbert one of these days .
1	excellent customer service - very attentive server ! very tasty fries with a wasabi , ginger aioli dipping sauce . they use high quality ingredients like nueske 's bacon in their bacon & egg fried rice which was delicious . the 4 people in our group had a couple of small plates and shared two large plates for just under $ 40 ( just water for drinks ) . we were satisfied with the portions received . we will definitely return to try some of the other menu items and to order some more of those tasty fries .
1	i 've been going there a year and half now and never once had a bad mean . service is top notch too . i 've been very happy with this place and i would strongly recommend this place . there lunch special is awesome too .
1	the best indian-chinese food in the gta -- we 've been to many indo-chinese restaurants & can vouch for it . susan , the owner , is very friendly & gives a lot of personal attention . the vegetarian manchurian balls are crispy on the outside & soft inside . the spicy pepper tofu was delicious , the veggie hakka noodles outstanding ! we 'll certainly go back with friends .
1	food is of a very high quality . owners care about their product and are present and attentive . the presentation of the food was reflective of thoughtful preparation and a care about what was being served . try this place , you won 't be disappointed .
1	you would be hard-pressed to find better banh mi in chambana , though that wouldn 't be the case up in chicago . the pho is good , but a bit pricey for the portions . i would recommend not getting the bubble tea , unless of course you 're cool with powdery bubble tea rather than fresh . the reason this earns such a high rating from me is the banh mi sandwiches . relatively cheap and filling and delicious ! not the absolute best , but still pretty damn good .
1	overall good place to eat at madison , wi .
1	i plan to go there for the first time friday early evening and get some sushi to bring home for guests ! ! i love sushi and i 'm a yelper i will keep ya posted on my opinion of their quality and service ! ! !
1	loved the spicy masago and the lumi seaweed ahi poki ! tasted so fresh and not slimy or fishy at all ! the loco moco was a tad bland and green tea mocbi was meh . the bento box was awesome - sprinkled rice , fried noodle , chicken teriyaki , oxtail spring roll , yellow cucumber , shrimp and vegetable tempura and a slice of spam and mac salad ! they do have sushi bar next room and all you can eat sushi .
1	never let me down : ) the other dishes are good as well but cold noodle here is the best !
1	we have always gone out to eat here and we are always satisfied ! the food is great and the service is good . best of all it is cheap ! only downside is the wait to be seated and sometimes parking .
1	went in for dinner , got seated right away . yelp reviews lead me to this restaurant . im a sucker when it comes to thai food ! yummm ! it 's a little joint in a ghetto area , but once ur inside the restaurant , it feels different ! it has this upscale casual ambiance . place is clean ! servers are very friendly . always had our water refilled . we had calamari for app , took about 5 mins to serve . then i had mild panang curry shrimp and bf had the pad thai ! took about 10 minutes to serve . we also tried their vanilla creme brulee . everything was excellent ! !
1	i am a regular here . great food , huge portions , good prices . owner lady is excellent and remembers your name if you order there regularly and makes nice small talk . delivery is quick and accurate if you order out . great customer service , great food , great portions , great prices . what more can you ask for ? a hidden gem in las vegas ! ! !
1	awesome service and the owners son visits your table to talk . the meats are top quality and they even teach you how to properly cook the meat ! family run since the 70 's . definitely going back soon !
1	he made our visit very pleasant ! we will be returning to this location more often ! !
1	very authentic flavors . i enjoy other noodle dishes such as pad see ew and drunken noodles , but i definitely think their pad thai is much better than the other noodle dishes on the menu . curries and soups are always delicious too ! of the 3 or 4 thai restaurants in the block , this is my favorite when i 'm craving pad thai . one portion size of this will feed a small family of four or one gluttonous foodie .
1	the food is absolutely flavorful & delicious ! it 's officially the best filipino restaurant in town , hands down ! ! !
1	add certain sake selections and dinner for two can easily top $ 600 . in fact , it 's uncommon to get out of there for less . but , that aside , you get what you pay for . with a wide range of dishes , there are generous portions if you order correctly and there 's nothing on the menu that isn 't first class in freshness , taste and presentation . probably not your everyday sushi place , but if you 're trying to impress clients or friends , this place is the disneyland of restaurants . located inside the hard rock hotel and tucked away in a corner , seek it out ... you 'll be glad you did .
1	there are other high-end restaurants nearby , but this has to be one of the better ones , must check out ! !
1	it 's still cheap ( if not cheaper than aloha since aloha recently remodeled last year ) , and the portions are superb . i enjoy getting the spicy korean chicken bowl , barely $ 6 after tax i believe . and my girlfriend always gets the chicken bowl , $ 5-something . there 's a lot of seats , and the service is usually pretty quick . this is always our go to if we 're in the area and want something cheap that would fill us up .
1	this place was delicious . they have a nice grill in the middle to grill some yummy meat and tons of sides . everything we tried was good and large portions . if i lived in vegas i would come here every sunday and eat like a pig !
1	food , service , ambiance . my wife and i went with my parents and asked chef simon to send whatever he liked out to us ( omakase menu ) . it did not dissapoint . everything was well balanced with clean flavors . my favorites ? the filet mignon , jidori chicken , and the crispy rice with seared tuna . and then there was dessert ! we tried them all and they were each pleasantly satisfying in their own way . i forget the name , but one was designed to taste like the korean melon bars . 10 stars for that one . all around it was a great night out just before all of the ufc festivities .
1	this is my favorite thai spot in vegas . my friends and i stumbled across this awesome restaurant by accident . we were in the same shopping complex trying to get a table at lotus of siam ( a very popular thai restaurant ) but , with the 45min wait we walked out and headed to arawan . the decor is beautiful and the atmosphere is very relaxing . bond our server was prompt , pollite and knowledgeable about the menu . he suggested we try the pad thai and the deep fried catfish . everything was amazing . make sure you save room for dessert ! ! ! we will be back thankyou bond and thang for the great food and service ! ! !
1	we love charm thai . great service and amazing food . yellow curry chicken is amazing . have had that dish many other places and it never compares . we eat there at least once a week . it 's that good .
1	affordable food and very tasty . service is always awesome . food comes out quick perfect for lunch break !
1	a little on the pricey side , but well worth it . amazing fresh sushi , excellent staff & wonderful ambiance . we highly enjoy & recommend the dees guys roll , ashley roll , & joes roll . of course paired with hot saki : ) you won 't be disappointed in this place !
1	as soon as you walk in the door you are greeted quickly and asked your preferences for seating . the sushi masters are handing you their own ideas of appetizers as you peruse the extensive menu . absolutely great service and great food ! i 'll be back ! by the way ayce is $ 25.95 for dinner , a definite killer deal considering the delicious and delicate nature of the sushi !
1	best chilli chicken by far ! ! so much flavour and so much food ! ! it 's like $ 8 for chilli chicken on rice and you get a massive portion ! i have had knock offs of this and nothing has come even remotely close ! ! yes , its not like the 5 star setting , but my rating is strictly on the food . taste is amazing . it 's a blend of indian and chinese so there is tons of flavour . oh , and its super fast service . if you call in they can have your food ready in about 15-20 min . yummy fast and cheap . must try ! ! !
1	i usually go to this place once in a month and i order different things . i havent been disappointed yet . the weekend lunch buffet is insane and very very tasty . food is awesome and the service is awesome as well . my only gripe is the ac .. its too damn cold . will definitely return to this restaurant .
1	the waiters were fantastic and attentive . the food was very filling and priced right . fresh ingredients and super spicy . you can 't go wrong with anything at chubby a cattle . you can go full cave man and order tons of meat or stick to veggies and tofu and go more healthy . and don 't forget the awesome sauce station that gives you the option to heat up any order . the conveyor belt is just a great plus to the restaurant . they have a limited alcohol menu but with soju and some wines and beer i can 't complain . one of the best restaurants in the area and a mainstay in a top food corridors in china town .
1	yay a very good chinese restaurant ! ! the food was equivalent to eating in chinatown san francisco for me . i am a very picky eater and this place was excellent . i had the shrimp with walnuts and it was soooo yummy . the vegetable fried rice is soooo good as well . thank you for making the best ! i will look forward to coming back .
1	although the food comes pretty quickly , it 's not fast food . very fresh and handmade to order in the glassed in kitchen . watch it being made . very authentic chinese food . $ 8.49 for the braised pork and egg and it was delicious ! potstickers were rolled and fried right in front of me , fresh . big portions and excellent service . i 'll be working my way through this menu . highly recommended .
1	this dish is soooo good- it will change your life . lightly breaded , fried eggplant in a sweet and spicy gingery sauce . get it . i live in the neighbourhood and come here often just to get this eggplant ( of course order other dishes too ) . noodle dishes are solid , pakoras are spicy , love the dragon chicken ( great cumin / coriander flavour ) . waitress is nice too ! great place to order take out and bring across the street to only cafe
1	i walked in and asked if the ac was working and the guy turned to get me an ice tea . lol . i moved to a table with more air circulating . sushi and edamame on the buffet ? wow ! so far so good . there 's a ton of food to choose from . i know i will be back !
1	i had the chicken teriyaki bowl which was delicious and definitely plenty of food . my boyfriend had the katsu chicken which had enough to take home and tastes great ! we shared the egg rolls which were excellent as well . my bowl was only $ 5 and out whole meal , including drinks was $ 20 . we will be returning !
1	i got spicy chicken ramen with wontons and brussel sprouts ! !
1	they have really good asian vegan food . everything i order here is good & pretty consistent . i love the general tzo vegan chicken . my son ordered the thai tea which is made with soy milk & he liked it . service is average . food is fantastic .
1	extra jalapeños or sauce , menu suggestions etc . we love the bonsai roll . everything tastes so fresh and the rolls come out quickly . the buy two get one free is awesome ! try the spicy edamame . delicious !
1	the waitress was really good to us especially , because my son was being a brat , and she really went out of her way to help him with treats etc . the food was very different hence some of the names ( fusion ) . we for the bulgogi fries which were an a recommendation from previous posts . totally worth it !
1	100 % would recommend . i ordered the fried pork chop with noodles , the serving was great , two people could share it. would probably come back to try the bento meals .
1	keep in mind that they were about to close in 30 minutes .
1	quite possibly the best hibachi ive had . sakana down the street sucks , not accommodating on anything .
1	it was weird , had unusual ingredients and it 's pretty much a staple that 's the same everywhere , so i was surprised . was our second time ordering delivery , consistently fast , hot , friendly , and the portions are good . we always order way too much food . the curry singapore noodles are wonderful , and they give you your choice of heat on most items . will keep going back ! 11 / 8 / 15 batting 1000 . ordered delivery . very good , fast ( about 45 minutes ) , and hot . : ) . during sunday night football ! their ribs and , salt and pepper wings are both great ! yummy .
1	food is great staff is friendly , and accommodating . seating area is small but the kitchen is open to watch them cook . first and only hawaiian bbq place i 'll eat at . if you are picky like me it 's a big step to try it but i wasn 't disappointed !
1	best i have ever tried . simple as that . amazing food , beautiful atmosphere and great service . i went on a double date and we all loved it . we highly recommend to try this place . we ordered the following : dynamite shrimp , garlic noodles , sesame chicken , korean bbq chicken , charcoal beef and black pepper beef . wow was my expectations blown away . every dish was delicious and clean and tasty . the dynamite shrimp and charcoal beef were the stars of the night . u must try these at least once . i have nothing but high praise for this special restaurent . 5 out of 5 !
1	clean , * * acceptable * * service , cheap and yummy . 4 things that are hard to find in other dim sum restaurants in vegas . the carts came around very quickly with a large variety , also something i have yet to experience in vegas . the dim sum was good , i will definitely be back . no more having to wait for a trip to cali to get my dim sum fix !
1	delicious , clean , friendly waitstaff , and not too pricey . place was packed with locals , and i can see why . if i lived in vegas i 'd go often ! had a vegetarian noodle dish . still dreaming about it ...
1	giada 's restaurant is top notch , first class , all the above ! i can try to describe everything about the restaurant but i don 't think i will be able to articulate properly . the words that need to be used to describe it is beyond my vocabulary . the very first celebrity chef restaurant i have been to that supersedes what you can expect . going here will be one of the best dinning experiences you will have .
1	drop everything and come here for lunch or dinner . if you like fresh seafood and ingredients this place is perfect . it 's like a chipotle for poke bowls . if you 've never tried a poke bowl this is the place to do it
1	i got the recommendation from a friend that frequents vegas and was he dead on that this place would be a hit . i forget what we ordered but it was off the hook ! one of the best things is that it wasnt served all sloppy . the presentation of the seafood platter looked good . i have to make sure i come here whenever im in las vegas !
1	i absolutely love the quality & variety sushi kaya has to offer ! i appreciate the sushi chefs acknowledging & greeting us when we walked in . i fully appreciated the amount of employees asking if we needed anything , although our server was attentive & helpful enough . although i 'm from la , i will be back , hopefully sooner than later !
1	menu offers options for the most discerning sushi eaters and non-sushi eaters ( ie many baked roll options ) . i recommend the oyster shooter with quail egg !
1	fairly extensive menu caused worry about quality sacrifice . ordered 4 different meals and everyone was really good without any repeating of style or flavor- served family style so all got samples . restaurant was not fancy but clean and tasteful . service from victor was excellent as he saw my parents unfamiliar with thai dishes and took time to describe , ask about their taste preferences , but then tactfully left the table to our meals . all this including combo appetizer and one dessert ( for dad ) . tab ? ...... $ 50
1	my husband and i go every other week with our 3 kids . the prices are amazingly reasonable and the food is out of this world . i always order the mongolian chicken ( non spicy ) and every time it is better than the last . the waiter knows us by now and always takes good care of our order and service is top notch . my family flew in from nj / ny and we had to take them to this place ... they loved it and want to come back during their next trip ! most people from the east coast know good chinese food so this was a big deal to get their approval .
1	ceviche n shrimp , wind beneath my wings ! ! ! ! ! one night to bangkok ! ! !
1	excellent sandwich shop & service . they make anything u want . in 15 minutes or less . you cant go wrong with this place . it 's not expensive . and the portion size is fantastic . thank you
1	this legendary post-night dish is best done at this chinese greasy spoon . there really is no other choice .
1	the price , friendly attitude and fresh sushi make this the place i go for a relaxing meal with a good book when i am in need of a pickup . this is not the best sushi i have ever had , but for a " local go to " i think it deserves 5 stars . i am so happy it is in my neighbourhood . check it out .
1	tried the joe 's special bento . ono mochiko chicken , chow funn with char siu inside ! ono pork hash , a good tasting hot dog ( not just the cheap mystery meat kind ) , only thing the teri beef was dry , maybe over cooked ? fresh steamed manapua is back in vegas ... no more frozen kine from the drugstore . the gracious aloha spirit is alive and well ! going to miss them at this location . retro bleu is staying but joe 's is going to their own place 12 / 27 / 2017 . going to have to drive little farther now for joe 's island grindz .
1	without question , a vietnamese restaurant 's legitimacy is measured by the quality of the ubiquitous pho broth . da vang 's has all of the earthy , aromatic , citrusy , salty richness that a pho connoisseur seeks when sitting down to a steamy bowl . add the bean sprouts and torn herbs , a squeeze of lime , and some peppers for hotness , and you are reveling in savory satisfaction . truth be told i 've been here a dozen times , and despite the allure of the rest of the menu , i have ordered the large bowl of pho every single time .
1	curry , rice , dessert for under $ 8 . i totally did not mind the " fast food " ambiance or that the meal was served on a plastic tray ( please don 't let this deter you from experiencing quality pakistani grub at a reasonable price ) - the food is delicious . i will be back . thanks fb ! v
1	5 stars for az that is : ) best pho restaurant i found while visiting ... hands down ... place is great , customer service is excellent and their spring rolls are amazing : ) super stoked to fly out to visit family and have this only a couple miles from their home : ) i shall return next time i 'm in az ! ! !
1	for $ 7 a dish ( and they are large ) you get a well cooked and seasoned thai dish . the service was excellent , very friendly and the food came out in a good amount of time and hot . if you want the glitz of the strip , then go pay some stupid prices for the same quality thai at the cosmopolitan . this restaurant is a little gem .
1	woot ! who doesn 't love very late night sushi ! i wish the avocado rolls weren 't $ 7 but that 's okay , they are so delicious and fresh , and i wish the soy sauce wasn 't sooooooo salty but that 's okay too b / c the food is great , the hours are fantastic and i saw they support other local businesses which i am all for . so , over all 5 stars !
1	came there 3 times during edc weekend and had pho 2 of those days and a rice plate during one . service was good , they came back to refill our water ( never happens at asian places ) . they also gave us a double plate of vinegar onions because they saw how much we ate of it . the mexican waiters there even know vietnamese !
1	) the service was on point when i went and the food came out very quickly . only downside i see is that there aren 't any private tables . the saketinis were delicious ! i tried the pomegranate and lychee and would highly recommend the lychee . the rolls were delicious , and if youre a raw food / sashimi fanatic , definitely try out the rose roll ! my server was very attentive and continuously checked in / out with me and my so . if you 're drunk or hungry at 2am and you 're looking for an amazing sushi restaurant , then stop by at kaizen !
1	this place isn 't winning any awards for outside appearance but the food is all i want and i want more of it !
1	i always love dropping by this restaurant when i am craving a big hot bowl of noodles . i always go with the traditional wonton noodles and no wonder this restaurant has had so many wonderful reviews for so long ! ! ! their noodles are the right amount of chewy and isn 't too soft but the best part is their wontons . they do not hesitate to put generous amounts of ingredients in each one ! after having 2-3 , i am stuffed ! you also cannot be more thrilled that your meal is less than $ 10 per person even if you add extra wontons or extra noodles and get a side dish of leafy greens !
1	we ate here this past wednesday and had a wonderful experience sitting at one of the grilling tables . between our party guests we had sushi , steak , chicken , salmon , shrimp , and lobster and everyone was pleased with their meal . we will be back .
1	this buffet has over 250 items . in general the food is average but the price and huge selection make it the best buffet in charlotte ! the hibachi grill is a great place to start . fill a plate with fresh vegetables , steak , chicken , shrimp , or crab and they will grill it with your choice of sauces : hibachi , teriyaki , garlic , etc ... includes : sushi bar , to-order hibachi grill , chinese / american dishes , salad bar , and an ice cream & desert bar . $ 6.59 lunch $ 8.99 dinner & sundays
1	it was my first time tonight and although the food wasn 't extraordinarily different than everywhere else it was still good . will definitely recommend and will be coming back !
1	their specialty sushis are on the expensive side but worth every penny . 5 starts for service , waiting , and decor . we have been coming to this establishment quite some times now and have enjoyed the food every single time . everything on the menu is half off on sunday 's .
1	i 've tried all the toronto poke shops - rolltation , poke guys , pokito , cali love and pokebox is definitely the superior in terms of quality of fish ( i 've had both the tuna and the salmon ) . having a bowl here feels more like a homemade poke bowl rather than the commercial feeling you get at the other stores . also , shout out to the zucchini noodles that are a great alternative to those on a non carb diet . my friend tried the tofu bowl which was surprisingly really tasty , so i would also definitely recommend that to all the vegans out there .
1	the chicken is much better than the beef and i love that they include fresh fruit with the plate . my only gripes are that i asked for brown rice and they gave me white rice and the veggies arn 't as plentiful as the description makes you think . * update , i just realized i ordered the plate without veggies instead of the works plate which does include lots of veggies . * other than that chix has very good service and they accept coupons you can find online from the my sundevil handbook or whatever . i would come back to chix and order just a couple of sides of chicken instead of ordering a plate next time .
1	called back they told me bulgogi doesn 't have any sauce on top so bulgogi is steamed beef !
1	we loved their happy hour food menu ( which is basically 50 % off chicken wings- totally worth it ) ! my husband had tea service and purchased a nice fragrant tea ( ~ $ 10 ) . they made the tea right in front of you in a traditional chinese tea set and made it like the traditional chinese people do . it was quite interesting ! this is the hotel lobby bar and it is kind of small . however , since they weren 't busy the day we were there , we did not have any issues with it being too crowded . we may be back in the future !
1	if you like vietnamese this is the best i have found in the west valley . not fancy decor however food makes up for simple atmosphere .
1	i 've tried a number of thai places in vegas and this is the best by far . thai style noodle house could hold it 's own in the bay area ... and that 's saying something ! as any good thai restaurant should - tsnh brings the heat so aficionados can rest assured they will get the goods . thai newbies - i wouldn 't order above a 5 ( they do 1-10 on the heat scale ) . this will be one of my go-to spots in vegas from now on !
1	i ate here years ago when it was the veggie house . i need to go back and try this place again .
1	i dined in and and. was greatly suprised at the service . she even offered to refill our drink several times . great change of pace for fast food . we will be back .
1	everyone else needs to learn how to smile . your work environment is surround by caffeine , take some espresso and wake up .... but kenny was awesome !
1	they have 2 small tables and a couple of chairs out front , but it was perfect . randomly decided to try this place on our way out to sedona and so glad we did ! ! wish i was hungry enough to try the sandwiches though . we got the shaved ice with fresh fruit ... omg ! so good ! ! ! ! my friend got some bun thit nuong . my friend loves it ! ! the fresh squeezed orange juice is so delicious , i 'm getting another one to go ! ! i highly recommend this place .
1	best poke restaurant in arizona . the sushi wrap was amazing , basically a sushi burrito but better ! if you love fresh fish and sushi , you will love this place . i hope they add more locations , preferably the north phoenix area !
1	pho was delicious . broth great . meat plentiful . bonus for boba tea .
1	exceptional fresh fish , great rolls and customer service .
1	we ordered food from another place and they were a no show . so after midnight , starving and grumpy , we placed an order here through foodora . i called and they received the order immediately . food came in 25 minutes and was delicious . will order again or maybe check it out in person .
1	my family and i have visited this place probably 3-4 times in the past month and a half . love their pho & vegetarian options . portions are good- everyone i 've visited with loved their meals . the waiters are very friendly and attentive . i hope they never lose their staff .
1	placed an in person takeout order and the waitress have me soup and nice conversation . will update with food . nice to go into a place and not be ignored ! edit : had the shrimp kung pao lunch special - delicious . and cheap !
1	the wait staff is super friendly and helpful . had the hire and ebi katsu , and gyoza . i enjoyed the garlicky flavor of the gyoza ! i was also a fan of the katsu dish which was $ 16.00 , but i used a groupon so it wasn 't too bad ! highly recommend you visit !
1	good customer service too . they helps you cook your food for you too . very clean place .
1	the first rule of nittaya 's secret kitchen is you do not talk about nittaya 's secret kitchen ! ( except to tell awesome people who love amazing food . always tell other awesome people . ) i heard it through the grapevine that this place was amazing , and oh-wow-uh ! i knew before my meal was over that i would become a regular & will attempt to try everything on the menu , eventually . extremely intimate & cozy ( for now ) , so become one of the initiated before the word gets out and the expansion starts . i 'll say no more ( for now ) .
1	, this place has the best ' char siew ' in town . it 's lean and just enough sauce without drowning it like most other places make the mistake of doing .
1	definitely one of the best thai places i 've been to in a long time . in my opinion , it doesn 't get much better than this . everything was delicious not too salty , not too greasy and not too spicy like a lot of other places tend to do . everything tasted authentic and myself and whole family thoroughly enjoyed ourselves . we will be back again .
1	let 's be clear , this place is not cheap . we didn 't have a reservation for the teppanyaki table but really wanted it . they moved us without any problem . they made great sake recommendations that didn 't break the bank . for my birthday , they brought free ( and legit ) desserts to everyone at the table . the extras in service really make the difference ! oh yeah and i enjoyed the food too !
1	this is my go to place for pho . eggrolls - didn 't like these - too greasy spring rolls - yum + hoisin peanut sauce yum + fish sauce yum serving size - very good . even an xl option if you 're super hungry . ambiance - ok , small , fast food-ish , not the best part of the experience but if you 're looking for great food this is the place to go . prices - also amazing , best i 've seen
1	got the combo banh mi , and it was the best i 've ever had ( besides portland at a food cart ) . the bread was toasted so everything was super warm with a crunchy exterior , and the ingredients inside were perfect . this one also has a cucumber which made the banh mi even better . also got the pho with everything , and although it was nothing special , it is still yummy and perfect after a long night out . will be back for the banh mi !
1	if you arrive early enough , you will get a table quickly . otherwise , be prepared for a wait during peak hours . my favorite is the shoyu base deluxe . how to describe the broth ... imagine sitting on your couch on a rainy day and putting netflix on and all you want is some hot ramen to hit the spot . their broth is like that plus 9000 ! the chashu is super tender and full of flavor . when you come here , definitely eat your ramen with a glass of melon cream soda . it pairs so well together .
1	the only place i 've been to in it is the grocery store but one day , i plan to check-out the lil gardens and restaurants . can 't wait until they get more in there ! ( don 't go expecting a big chinatown-like scene . ) the take-out from inside the grocery store is pretty tasty , inexpensive and fast ! see ya there !
1	now i 'm hooked on it . i had a few bad experiences with sushi prior to giving rm a try . yes , it is expensive ! i have been 3 times and the staff is very friendly ( i always sit at the bar ) . i have not had anything but the sushi however so this review is based strictly on that . the rm roll was amazing ! by far and away the best tasting sushi i have had .
1	the food and service is amazing for this family owned restaurant . fresh and incredible food . i 've been here several times and will keep coming back . walking through the front door it 's like going through a time warp back to 1985 ... oak and gold everywhere ! look passed the dated decor and you 're sure to have an excellent meal / service ! prices are reasonable . the after dinner free digestif drink is a nice touch ! it 's like a mint cookie in a glass ! it 's funny because the place is always packed with the local old peeps . i guess they know good food !
1	i really like the pad thai here ! i will definitely come back whenever im in town ! my new to-go thai restaurant in vegas ! : )
1	came here for late night sushi and he offered excellent knowledge of the rolls and sake . the quality of the food matches the price . best non ayce place i 've had in vegas !
1	this restaurant is off the beaten path and not somewhere you want to walk to ( we did ) , it 's up the cable car and a very long walk away from everywhere . arriving we looked in the window , its big , the decor lacking and dated , but the food makes up for all of that ! delicious , possibly some of the best italian food we have eaten in or out of italy . priced very reasonably , next time we visit pittsburgh we will grab an uber and eat there again ! did we mention it 's byob and there is car parking beside the restaurant .
1	the service is ehhh , has gone down over the years , but the food is so good i just keep going back : )
1	5 stars for the galbi platter with l.a.cut ribs chicken katsu and chicken jun. great stuff not too greasy and can feed two
1	awesome assistance / recommendations on sushi rolls . cannot comment about their ramen or steakhouse items but the sushi is some of the best i 've had .
1	i always used to resent my grandparents for insisting on staying here all the time , but no pool filled with ed hardy speedo wearing juiceheads who overdosed on the t & didn 't get enough g or l in ( amg , i 'm totally swooning right now , can you tell ) can compare to this teriyaki chicken .
1	kimchi fries is a misleading name , really this is more comparable to a weird fusion take on a poutine , with pulled pork , kimchi , mayo , and some other stuff piled onto fries . i don 't like to think about what the calorie count on this bad boy is , but something keeps me coming back ... the banh mi are also really good , especially the pork belly . it 's always full of people eating alone so you know it 's that good .
1	the spinach deep fired was awesome . i did not care for the chicken ( some number ) . i will definately go back for the rice " pooding "
1	my favourite place in the cheap eats division , and a few other divisions as well .
1	the inside was large and clean . i noticed while dining in a lot of people call in their orders and pickup .
1	staff are super friendly , and our food came out quickly . we were starving after bowling at red rock casino and wanted something fast , but not fast food . found this place nearby . never heard of samurai sams before , but im a fan now . we got a chicken terriyaki bowl combo with potstickers and a yakisoba with salmon . quality was great . portions were filling . teriyaki sauce was bomb ! and best of all , we didn 't feel like crap after : d now i wish we had a location back home : (
1	i love the orange chicken . spring rolls are tasty . great prices for big portions .
1	it 's like .. gingery sweet with a kick of black pepper omg so good ! yes yes yes ! no other fried rice can compare !
1	5 stars for one of the best waitresses i 've ever have had and i think she goes by jazz ! ! she is worth the trip alone . only bad thing i can say is for some reason the sushi chefs act kinda mean to her in front of customers . maybe she doesn 't eat sushi ? lol grumpy sushi chefs are easy to find but 5 star waitresses only come around once in awhile . thanks again jazz for some amazing service and being so nice to us ! ! !
1	always smiles and excellent service from them every time i go in . oh and the dogs are pretty awesome too . really liked the angry kimchi fries the first time i ordered them but was too oily the next couple times around .
1	so healthy and delicious - kwan ( the chef ) buys all of the produce fresh and prepares the meals right as they are ordered . nothing is frozen ( even the salmon ! ) the flavors in the red chicken curry dish that i ordered were so authentic and delicious ! don 't be deterred by the size of this joint - it 's amazing : )
1	i always drive all the way from mississauga to this amazing location . always fresh and clean place .
1	great food and awesome service . i had the udon noodle with shrimp tempura bowl . sooooo good . girlfriend got a tuna roll and loved it .
1	i go to the laser hair removal center right next door and eat here about 4 times a week . their lunch box is delicious . service is prompt and friendly . prices are reasonable . the sushi is fresh and they have the best spicy scallop hand roll in town for dinner i have tried their teppenyaki . it was amazing . you have to try their red fried rice . the food was fresh and the chief was very well trained . he did some fun tricks . i had the steak wife had the shrimp . fairly priced for teppenyaki and i would recommend it to my friends .
1	very decent prices and friendly owner : - ) freshly made , but could improve on the quality of the shrimps . too many fried options , luckily what was grilled was delicious . delivers in the area . will come back. definitely .
1	we had an amazing server tonight , and all the food was to die for . i 'm seriously new to the sushi game so am a little apprehensive to try new rolls and mixes , but at doh i 'm pretty confident and never disappointed ! ! my new fav is the nacho daddy .. bomb.com ! ! ! ! and if you 've seen my other reviews you know i 'm a sucka for any love story involving tempura ice cream .. well hello lover , you had me at tempura .
1	i tried the chicken with veggies and brown rice plate , $ 3.99 special- good and healthy : ) you could tell it was cooked over lava rocks . and they actually have a good assortment of hawaiian sun drinks . definitely try it out , and when you do , don 't forget to ask for the yummy lava sauce .
1	food was ready in the exact time they told me for my takeout order . all the food we got was excellent . best thai food restaurant that we 've been to in the summerlin area - and we 've tried a bunch . glad they got their takeout business on track and glad i came back for a 2nd try .
1	they made things right after a most unpleasant cashier experience . i 'm glad to see that the company is run by people who are smart enough to care about their customers dining experience .
1	5 stars for cleanliness of dining room and bathroom . and for the price of the food , i give it 4.5 stars for quality and portion size . also 5 stars for extensive entree options and extensive drink options . thanks for a quick and awesome meal !
1	great value . great home made quality . paper plates and plastic utensils but the food is great and the price is right . family owned since 2009 and they deserve success !
1	fresh and you get what you paid for ! the service was fast and friendly ! we went around 3 : 00 and there was no line up and the place was empty ! we ordered the sweet shrimp , blue fin tuna belly , sea urchin , crispy spicy salmon , soft shell crab , scallop sushi , and japango roll . everything impressed me literally ! i was most impressed about the sweet shrimp . not only was it fresh and alive , it was sweet and then they deep fried the shrimp heads and boy ! was it amazing ! ! ! i highly recommend ordering the japango roll , it was an instant fave ! ! ! !
1	let 's just say , in the lady 2 weeks , this is the 3rd time we 've eaten here . egg fried rice is so good ! ! we 've had the shrimp lo mein twice and both times it was just amazing and full of flavor . i 'm so happy thos is right around the corner . it 's absolutely delicious . i can 't wait to explore the menu more , i need the singapore noodles in my life !
1	the marriage of sweet and savoury flavours work perfectly . the icecream itself has miso in it , and sprinkled with dry seaweed . other dishes we tried and loved : fried wings and the moto bun . fried wings have a lot of batter but it is flavourful and crunchy . highly recommend ! atmosphere is great for dating ( especially first few dates ) . light is dim , and you do feel like you are in one of those alley bars in tokyo . also : do not order hamachi tartare . it is a disaster dish . fish doesn 't taste fresh , and toooo much toppings , just way too much .
1	strawberry milk tea is great , taro milk green tea is great , or just plain milk green tea sugar free ( now that i 'm on a diet ) is great ! i like the seafood undon noodles soup is amazing there and also i always order the pork vermicilli noodles . reasonable price and great for my taste buds .
1	i love this location ! especially today on my lunch break . when i walked in , all the employees had smiles on their faces and two instantly greeted me ! it 's always nice to see smiling faces especially after being at work all day . also the food is extremely fresh and made to perfection ! thank you much ! i will definitely continue to spend my lunch breaks with you guys !
1	i would give this place a 5-star rating if it were in la ... or kyushu for that matter . authentic housemade hakata-style ramen ( thin and al-dente ) . pork is smokey and crispy on the outside . broth is flavorful . if this place ever closes i will cry ... keep doing what you do tampopo !
1	i 've never had shell on shrimp like this & would recommend it to anyone . also , the khao soi with duck was as good as anthony bourdain 's reaction to it lead me to believe . staff was very quick & friendly , which was saying something for how busy they were on a monday night . when in vegas , get off the strip & check this spot out
1	hmmm , what else can i say ? ordered the black cod miso ! simply heaven . sake serving ware is cute . ambiance and decor is tres chic ! bring some $ !
1	however- a picture says a thousand words , but in this case its not enough . small family run establishment- however the quality of the food and the presentation can go head to head against the giant corporate restaurant chains . the best part about this place is the price . i could not imagine what $ 20 got me here . half chicken ( gravy ) - korean beef combo- springrolls - steamed veg all items were phenomenal . sometimes i feeeeeel like i walked out of heaven ! ! ! ! !
1	i always come here with my brother and my friends and we have become regulars ! i love the idea of the card with 6 or more times you eat = free meal ! nice ! service is always quick , friendly and the owner is very nice ! sashimi and spicy crispy salmon maki rolls are superb ( very crispy ) . i enjoy this place so much i come here a couple of days in a row sometimes .
1	i had never had indian cuisine until tonight . the waiter was amazing and explained everything on the menu and what kind of meat was good with it . very clean , inviting , and polite staff . our drinks were never empty . the food was high quality and super good . my tika masala was spicy , so without hesitation , my waiter brought out a cucumber yogurt sauce and said it was like a fire extinguisher . he was right ! go eat here . you won 't regret it ! ! ! : )
1	oh how i miss stuffing my hungover face on sunday afternoons . ayce dim sum bye bye . i hope i did not put them out of business with my can you eat all approach . on the positive side i have probably lost 10 pounds since this place closed and will have to add a couple of holes to my belts .
1	had a great time here . ordered a simple rice and orange chicken dish . they also have sushi here . very modern decor and lighting was dark , yet subtle . asked my girl to be my girlfriend here , so that may have biased my opinion just a bit . but now this place will always be a special spot .
1	i would be super detailed like most everyone else , but the reviews don 't lie about this place . treat yourself you wont be disappointed
1	she put us first with consistent unforgettable customer service . she was very entertaining and fun but yet professional . her and her staff at nyny represent friendly and energetic staff who knows how to attract and retain loyal customers . i will definitely tell my experience to my fans when i am on stage doing stand up . btw , her name is yanira torres and she was wearing a red rose shirt . this type of employee makes a fine example of a contributor who will be a great asset to any company . she surely stood out with distinctions in service , experience , and professionalism .
1	it is by far amazing ! everything is soooo good ! ! not only the food but the service is great ! everyone is so sweet and friendly . love this place ! got myself a punch card , will be back soon !
1	) . the fish is so fresh , the flavors are amazing , and the atmosphere is fun too ! the staff are all friendly . as soon as you walk in , the entire staff greets you . some of my favorite rolls include the screaming orgasm , spring mountain roll , almost 90 % , and the lisa hand roll . just writing this review makes me want to go have some now ! ! ! ! !
1	this restaurant is good i am definitely coming here again . flavor was fantastic and meats were very juicy . the crab legs were pre-cut , which made it convenient ! i love this place
1	this place is definitely underrated as well and unknown which is great because you get amazing service but we definitely need to spread the word about this place . service is great . sushi is amazing . hibachi is so good . i work in the service industry and have no complaints what so ever . my co workers and i go here weekly , sometimes twice a week ! keep it up and get your name out more !
1	i 've been coming here for years and will be coming back for many more ! the food is absolutely amazing with the service to match . i cannot recommend this place enough and always recommend it to anyone looking for a good lunch spot or a place for a quick evening bite . i would recommend the grilled pork and pork belly as well as the kimchi fries . can 't wait to eat here again !
1	it 's hard to find a good chinese take out that has real flavor , and this place has it . from their orange chicken , fried rice , orange peel chicken , low mein or pork pot stickers .. everything was great ! and seemed like good quality / fresh .
1	i was able to find vegan options and they accommodated to my request of having veggies stir fried in avocado oil ! ! ! love love love ! ! ! ! ! and , everyone was super nice : - )
1	just because it 's the only place i know downtown that caters to us vegetarians in such a creative way . the menu alone will really impress anyone that enters . they have over 60 vegetarian items with fake meat or tofu . it 's crazy to imagine what you can try next . my favs are the eel , sweet and sour pork and lobster ... you must try it to believe it ! i take all my friends vegetarian and meat eaters .
1	8 pieces for $ 8.00 . only fried tofu that 's lightly battered ( similar to a tempura batter but lighter ) and melts in your mouth . i don 't care for the normal rubber dried out fried tofu everyone serves . but ... this is the only place i 've found that makes fried tofu like this . i eat here at least twice while in vegas just for the crispy tofu . other notable mentions are the shrimp fried rice and dim sum .
1	just opened up too so everyone should come down and support it , great prices for how amazing and fresh all the food is , and they give you alot ! best thai nearby , beats thai elephant and thai basil for the same and cheaper prices . 100 % 5 stars , come try since its new , once people find out , this 'll fill up fast !
1	it 's a shame i don 't live in the state of arizona anymore , because this is my favorite korean restaurant in the whole country . yes the whole country ! i wish i can pick this place up and move to it to nor cal . i 'd trade every single korean restaurants up here in exchange for this place . just thinking about this place makes my mouth water . trust me , you won 't be disappointed . my favorite dishes here are the daeji bulgogi and seafood sundobu . by the way , if there is a certain pan chan dish you enjoy , you can always ask for more !
1	love this place . already a ton of yelpers have yelped about cherry blossom noodle cafe . i am sure most of them are similar to my love for this place . spicy beef noodle bowl .
1	luv all their food . since moving from la , i have missed good asian food ! ! the udong and katsu bowl curry is my favorite . their korean style dishes does not taste korean but it 's still good . and compared to all the other asian restaurants in town , this beats them ! ! still trying out everything on their menu ! ! very good ! ! ! luv this place ! ! a little over priced but you do get a lot of food ! ! and for dessert , you can go next door to the snoh place ! ! yummy ! !
1	i have yet to eat here but my rating is for how great the chilli oil is ! i drive across from mississauga just for it ! if you like spicy toppings like me then you must try it ! price has gone up to $ 5.50 per bottle now .
1	i like everything about this place ... including the wait to get inside ! the 15 minute queue gets you get in the mood , you get to anticipate your food and plan it out . of course , i won 't come here in the winter and wait outside . that would be absurd . i had a very nice ramen soup ( great noodles ) . the potato salad started was unexpectedly good . great service , people are so nice . will definitely be back .
1	the owners have great memories and remember their customers , and have good customer service ( which you hardly find in many asian restaurants , imo ) . one of them brought out some fried spring rolls wrapped in rice paper , which i 've never tried before but loved . it was cute when he said , " here . this is for the baby . " i 'm currently expecting and thought it was a very kind gesture . we 've been there twice and enjoyed it both times . next time , we will try the pork chop and broken rice , which they recommended both times .
1	i used to come here a lot more ( when i had a well-employed boyfriend who always paid ! ) . since it 's been frugal times around these parts i 've been going out to eat a lot less . this weekend we had a late night out and forgot to eat dinner , i suggested this place because i remembered the hours and how good the food was . so we rolled in at about 1am , no problem getting a table ! the service was great and the food was as yummy as i remembered . the menu is huge so you can have more traditional real chinese food and americanized versions , too . and the kill tanks are pristine !
1	nuff said .... ok , i guess this wasn 't a good enough review so let me elaborate . i 'm from out of town and no matter where i am in vegas i will come here during my visit and before i leave to grab some poke . my favorite is the spicy ahi poke but as i said before everything else is equally as good too . if you 're local or from out of town , stop by and check it out ... that is , if you 're not afraid of raw seafood = )
1	great selection of cold saki ; tofu was on point ; the golden avacado is a must ( ) ; the godzilla roll offered an exquisite balance between flavor and temperature and the boston roll had fantastic flavor combination . highly recommended - we will be back ! ! parking is limited .
1	this is not a fancy , americanized sushi restaurant with avocado cream cheese this and that rolls . this is the kind of place you 'd find in japan with common , authentic meals . perfect for family dining .. the noodles are always a hit with the kids . the sukiyaki is my fave ! ! we come here as often as possible
1	never a disappointment in the quality and service . been dining here for years and always recommend it to friends looking for legit high grade sushi in az ! ! !
1	if you are in vegas ... you have to try this place . the food is amazing and the service is incredible . the owner serves you personally and is super fun and laid back to chill with while you are there = ) i had several things ... the peanuts as a starter , chicken cutlet , spare ribs and some others i can 't remember but everything was just amazing !
1	there are nicer pho restaurants around the gta but this restaurant has the best pho in town . the staff are friendly and the food comes out quick and hot like most other pho restaurants . my only complaint is that the seats are really tight and i always find my chair bumping into other chairs and i 'm forced to squeeze in . this place is cash only !
1	love at first bite of the pork belly steamed bao ! i was head over heals for that bao . the bao was soft and warm . the pork belly was tender , juicy and melted in my mouth . hmmmm ...... it was so good ! ! i tried the kimchi fries after finished the bao , and i was falling head over heels again . couldn 't imagine kimchi , pulled pork , green onion and fries can be this perfectly matched . ohhhh ........ i couldn 't get them out of my head now ........ got to come again and again ...............
1	he was personable , friendly , expressed interest in us , and bantered with our kiddos . food way above average , he even asked if we wanted an extra appetizer that was made free of charge ( spare ribs , yum ) we split the duck and enjoyed the tenderness . great strong drink gulped - mai tai love the ambiance & atomosphere . you 'd think being next to asu that if would be filled with a bunch of college kids . not the case . good mixture of families , groups , couples , and even high schoolers out for prom
1	sweet potato fries came with a killer sauce with wasabi in it . don 't miss this place !
1	the bf and i have an undying love for he oxtail soup here ! the only pho bowl we will order . the oxtail is a must try ! ! !
1	the chow 's general chicken , fried rice , and pork bun are delicious and a must . if you 're in the dt area , do not miss this ! ! ! !
1	i should have read more reviews . the restaurant has a sushi bar located on the lower level and a dining room with a bar on the second level . the staff was very friendly and the place appeared to be very clean . the sushi was outstanding . very fresh . the poke was excellent , as well as the yellowtail with jalapeños . everything was wonderful . well deserving of five stars . i would definitely recommend dining here . i will be back for sure .
1	this place is no joke . they do it right . all of the food is fresh and delicious . the service is great and the atmosphere is what you 'd expect . you have to be willing to surrender your will to the chef but i can assure you that its worth it . we had no idea what was coming to the table but it was all awesome ! we 'll definitely be eating with the people at shinbay again .
1	im sure the rest of the yelpers did a good job describing the place . it is very nice and the curry isnt something i can compare with any other restaurant . it is pretty much liquid gold . great quality and the katsu is made nicely on the spot . the store owner is very friendly . i would def come more often if it was a bit cheaper ( i mean its takeout afterall ) or if they offered more curry per serving .
1	try the avacado roll , shrimp tempura roll , miso soup and salad ... bargain at $ 15- $ 20 per person with non-alcoholic drink and handmade sushi and maki . cheers andrew ( c ) copyright 2017 . andrew m. walduck . associated press . all rights reserved .
1	we decided to eat outside because it was such a nice day . the staff always had two large carafes on our table with water . my thai friend ordered the sukothai , and was very satisfied . i ordered the street noodles # 1 , pork belly buns , sweet and spicy pig wings , and the thai fried chicken . i would highly recommend each of the aforementioned dishes . i will definitely be back .
1	this is a great spot for a satisfying , inexpensive lunch in the middle of toronto tucked away in a food court . this past visit , i tried their jerk chicken bao and tofu with enoki bao . both featured a well-balanced contrast of textures and flavours . the line can get long , but it moves fast . to combat this , it seems like they have something where you can order ahead on your phone and pickup . that seems worth checking out if this is a favourite of yours .
1	delicious food and awesome service . love my catfish po boys and everything in it so fresh always . i have my own car now and can follow you everywhere lol : )
1	it was that good . it was some of the best poke i have had in vegas . they don 't smother the fish in sea salt and oil like some places do . you can actually taste the fish . they also fried us some tofu , which was not on the menu . that was nice of them . the yellowtail hand roll and the dragon roll were also excellent . the kitchen and dining area were very clean . the staff was very friendly . it was definitely worth the drive from summerlin . i recommend that you stop in and have some poke or whatever else you care to try . i will be back ! !
1	you feel like you 're walking into a families kitchen and they treat you like it . but most importantly the food is phenomenal . if you 're looking for a warm environment and great food for a good price . china hot wok is your place .
1	my new found thai restaurant in vegas . i love thai cuisine that i know when i eat thai food , i know if it 's aurhentic or not . krung siam made me fall in love on how tasty and yummy their food . i have recommended this place to my friends & guests . can 't wait to go back soon ! !
1	although there were a couple mistakes on our order , lei took care of us and made our visit a great one . so thank you lei ! love coming here because of the portion size , one plate could feed two people .
1	is not overpriced and they have a lot of tasty options . the service could be better , we had to be waiting and waving to the waitress to get their attention . they forgot some stuff in our order but it wasn 't a big deal since everything else was really good . i just happened to check in and i discovered a coupon on yelp , when i mentioned it to the server she didn 't seem happy about it . the food was so goo that i will go back again and again and won 't care about the service : ) i can keep getting my own napkins , plates etc from other tables .
1	the owners are from oc , cali ... everything here is very authentic and flavorful . all the rice dishes are great . the pho has great broth and generous portions . best of all , all of the employees are very knowledgable and personable . they make it a point to help you understand how each dish should be used in condiments and they make it a point to be friendly and get to know you . most asks places aren 't very personable . great ownership and great food !
1	1 . presh pried pish prom philipino polks . 2 . ahhhhhh i feel like i 'm in daly city again . win . 3 . m u s t .. r e f r a i n .. from .. picking up multiple packages of dried squid , mango .. 4 . dude , where else am i gonna find fresh coconut and lychee on this side of town ? 5 . hmm .. what am i gonna buy from valerios when i 'm done with this place ?
1	same owner as sushi mon , goyemon & monta ramen and just as good . it 's not as busy yet but just wait as it is just a matter of time till you have to wait at all hours . if you get extra noodles for your leftovers you can also get extra broth and they will put it in 2 containers so your noodles don 't get soggy .
1	one of my top choices here . service always great .
1	no name sushi is a must try ! ayce is not limited to the sushi you can have just about anything from that menu . the food is delicious a must eat in vegas come hungry and you will leave happy .
1	pad that was very good . the pork belly with rice was phenomenal , perfectly cooked and seasoned and presented.m. definitely best i ever had . the peking duck croquettes were also amazingly delicous . we also tried the bahn mi all the glaciers and they were very fresh and tasty .
1	great thai food . the red curry was the best i have had on this side of town . on par with archie 's !
1	6 / 5 , got the pork belly bowl and my girlfriend got the ramen. best ramen she 's had since japan and the pork belly bowl was delicious. also fast service and very reasonable , i could barely finish the pork belly bowl and it was less than $ 6 , what a deal. you have to give this place a try
1	literally blown away by the quality and amount of sushi chef hiro serves at that price . highly recommend if you 're craving sushi in the las vegas area !
1	i haven 't had authentic korean bbq outside of korea , but ginseng bbq did it ! ! ! perfect food , perfect service , perfect atmosphere . thank you so much !
1	best ayce i 've been to in the states : ) they have a great selection of chinese , american , japanese food , sushi and sashimi , fresh veggies and fruit . everything tasted really fresh and delicious- i particularly loved the sushi area : they even have so many different types of sashimi ( salmon , egg , different types of tuna , etc / all fresh and delicious ) . 11 / 10 would recommend fiji grill buffet ! : ) .
1	their soup is homemade and the beef is just tender enough , and they always give so generously . you can add an extra bowl of soup for 2 $ .. if you can still stomach it after your first bowl of pho . if you catch their morning-4pm specials , you can get the l1 combo of pho and spring-roll for 6.99 $ ( essentially adding a spring-roll to a regular sized pho ) come here all the time now .
1	if you 're 60 , you even get a discount . . i really enjoy eating there with friends with whom , we have different preference , i only eat vegetable , fish and chicken , a friend doesn 't eat meat but seafoods , this is prefect place for us .
1	crispy , savory and delicious . very generous proportion . $ 6 incl. tax . like woah !
1	long line ups during lunch but they are fast . you get a ton of food and when you finish you won 't feel gross because it 's clean eating .
1	i have ordered food from xo at least twice a month for 6 months in a row . every dish so far has been amazing ! they have great service .... great good .... amazing delivery service ! orange chicken is fresh and white meat ! you won 't be disappointed .
1	everything tastes so fresh down to the sprouts and garnishes . why go elsewhere ? oh did i mention the personable chefs and great atmosphere ?
1	to start , the food was simply amazing . high quality and delicious ! the service was impeccable . so kind and attentive ! it was a busy friday night and we never felt rushed at all . the prices weren 't on the cheap side , so this is the place to go for a special occasion , but man is it worth it ! i want to try them for lunch next .
1	the freshest oysters we 've had so far in las vegas . nice and plump with very little of an ocean taste . we sat at the bar and served by the most friendliest guy . it was a great atmostphere . we will consider coming back in the future . usually we just go to asian buffet for all you can eat oysters but really it 's a huge difference in quality .
1	they voted 5 out of 5 . this place is great food and the drinks were all good . been here before and will continue to support . ninja was great , lobster tail sushi was good . let 's continue to support .
1	sat at the bar and watched the nhl playoffs . the spicy edamame was excellent , and all sashimi was fresh . nice presentation !
1	they have a regular menu also but the ayce sushi is sooooo good and it 's great quality . can 't say enough i stop here every time i 'm in town .
1	haven 't been back in 3-4 years . after trying many other places around town , i brought a few people here for an all you can eat extravaganza . very glad we did ! ! excellent service ! ! ! ! ! unique rolls and very high quality . totally worth $ 25 my friends who had never been here before raved the entire time . if you are reading this , be sure to review sushi factory and tell others .
1	and it still has 5 stars . and i 'm going to give it 5 more stars . the wait is long , but it is worth it . you know how much it is worth it ? we drove 3 hours from sierra vista to try this place and we do not regret that drive . this was worth the drive . the wait is long . we got there at 10 : 15 and walked in the door at 1200 exact . it is worth the wait .
1	curry chicken even had potatoes in the sauce and when you order you tell them how spicy you want your food from 1 to 10 .. i had 5 and it was just right . super friendly service .
1	quick service and friendly as can be too . new go to lunch place when my coworkers are not down for chinatown .
1	very nice and hospitable owners . this will be on my list of regular lunch spots .
1	don 't hate . i 've been here 5 times mostly for dinner . tastes varies but good nonetheless .
1	cucumber , peanuts , kim chee , hot dog , ect . food has big portions
1	awesome drinks and a great value for your money ! !
1	this place is amazing ! hana sushi and vegas rolls are the standouts ! end with a dynamite x2 roll and a sake bomber and you have a great evening .
1	other restaurants really can 't beat this value / quality combo ! i got the tonkotsu ramen as is and it was enough for me to be content . the broth was rich and creamy . it was a little salty but nothing too overpowering . my friends got the spicy tonkotsu and kim chi fried rice . they said both were very good . this restaurant is really small ... probably doesn 't seat more than 25 people so try to best the lunch and dinner rushes . 5 stars for sure !
1	the poke nachos , victerino roll , spicy edamame , yellow tail jalapeño , and fish tacos are all amazing !
1	my fiancé and i went there on a busy friday night and were seated immediately by friendly staff , they were really attentive and even eager to assist us with recommendations which helped for us first timers to this type of hawaiian / japanese fusion food . we both especially like ahi poke appetizer which was on a delicious cracker , we also had pork belly on a stick but honestly everything we had there was amazing ! a must if you 're looking for something delicious !
1	i could eat the crab stack salad every day of the week . each dish has so much flavor and is so inventive and unique . service is great . i can 't wait to go back and take friends .
1	i usually don 't give any buffet or restaurants 5 five unless they are worth it .. i 've literally eaten all of vegas buffet , this one is by far the best even though it 's a bit pricey . i feel like every once in a while i come , the price just keep increasing ... il still go but not as often as i would like the menu do change once in a while , but some food is always the same , meat , mexican , noodle bar , sushi , chinese and seafood . the only thing they change often is dessert .. sometime it 's good and other times are not ..
1	ughhhhh , this is what we drive to get to george & sons , yes it is that good ! several years ago we were treated to take out at a friends house and as it turns out she picked up dinner from george & sons and we have been hooked ever since . stand outs for us is the sizzling rice soup , shrimp spring rolls filled with nothing but shrimp , thai basil chicken and the honey walnut shrimp . everything tastes fresh and as it should be . the service is top notch and it the mood strikes him , even george himself might stop by to say hello .
1	rice , salad , teriyaki chicken , veggie and shrimp tempura and 4 pc california roll ) is as good as it gets ! its fast and there is always a table , no wait time whatsoever . here is my take on this place 1 . bathrooms are clean 2 . wait staff are always sweet , fast and attentive 3 . food is great 4 . great price for the food
1	we had lobster and filet . quality was spot-on ! food is always perfectly cooked and seasoned , portions generous and delicious . this has become my regular fine dining restaurant , no need to drive to the strip or anywhere when i have perfection a mile from home . service ? outstanding ! kevin is the best waiter anywhere , and i always reserve seating in his section . summary : perfect dining experience always - for almost a year ! wonderful .
1	customer service was excellent and place was clean : has an a health code rating posted . my mom ordered sweet and sour pork , she was delighted that the sauce came on the side. overall nice relaxing american chinese food restaurant
1	the quality of their meat is great . the service is exceptional . i will be coming back for sure .
1	add a special staff performance , the convenient location ( ~ 3 miles west of the strip ) , and an up-to-date and huge song selection = great night . if you get bit by the singing bug in vegas , look no further than karaoke q to heal what ails you . go !
1	who cares if there is lots of spices and probably msg . for this price , you eat till your merry and drink till your joyeous . also finding outdoor seating is a bonus . does have a more mature and male oriented crowd later on in the night , however in my eyes this has been a gem since i was in college . even as an adult , the taste doesnt wear off and the price doesnt change ! ! you might see me here ! ! being loud and eating like a beast .....
1	i was a fan of fate but 905 is a vast improvement . the food is fresh and interesting. the eel and foie grois is amazing . as is everything that i 've tried with duck in it , ( dumplings , crepes , tea infused salad ) . i 'm not a big fan of pork but my friends are and they all love the pork belly dishes . the crab roll is amazing with fresh crab and avocado . the servers are all great , friendly and remember you every time you come . i definitely recommend 905 .
1	we weren 't too hungry so shared 3 appetizers - a smoked salmon spring roll , firecracker shrimp and crispy calamari , and finished sharing a ginger creme brulee . everything delicious - even the geezers sitting at the next table cackling over an arpaio-inspired silent auction of pink underwear while we watched ireland and estonia square off in a soccer match from the bar . only in a city . it 's nice that downtown is starting to feel like one .
1	5 min from the strip . good sushi . they do charge for leftovers so just be judicial when ordering .
1	5x better then l & l bbq and better then ono hawaiian bbq in la . the mix plate with kalbi and the fried chicken bites with glaze sauce , i forgot the name lol , but was excellent ! i would definitely take the 12 min drive from the vegas strip to island flavor for hawaiian food .
1	it was my first time here and the staff was so nice and helpful ! one girl suggested the spicy albacore as it 's her personal favorite and i 'm so glad she did-it 's tender and the perfect amount of addictively spicy . they answered any questions i had while walking me through my order and letting me sample whatever peaked my curiosity . i just really enjoyed their personable service and since i work near by , they will definitely see me more often ! ; )
1	a sign of good food , for sure . i was pretty impressed with their spicy tonkotsu . it had a good amount of spice without being overbearing , it had some thickness to it , and the thin noodles were delicious . it was ~ $ 8 for a bowl and well worth it . to top it off , service was quick , attentive , and friendly . definitely will come here again the next time i 'm in vegas !
1	authentic flavors unlike most other places . chicken was a bit overcooked but its a must try . 8 / 10 green curry : was also tasty but too watery for my liking . missing green eggplants .
1	there are plenty of waiters / waitresses to fill your drinks and bring you appetizers . a handful of the sushi chefs are great and fun to talk to . the food speaks for itself . just pick what you like or what sounds good and you 'll have a good time for sure .
1	if you want vegetables you need to add 3 dollars . but my main course is only meat , so it was not a problem for me . the chicken was so fresh and tender , and the sauce was good too . with a bottle of plum juice , cannot help feel full and happy
1	one of my go to restaurants to eat . ingredients are fresh , you watch them as they make it right infront of you . service is top notch as always every time i go . place is always clean but with limited seating . extremely hard to find parking sometimes . usually people park at the gas station and walk right in .
1	3 of us dropped a grand with some delicious cold sake ... worth every penny !
1	value is excellent . vegetables are all fresh . meats remain frozen which is nice as it keeps bacteria away . sauces are amazing . been there 2 days in a row .
1	there 's a 5 % discount for paying with cash , so make sure you bring enough . highly recommended for larger parties as well , since there are many large tables available and you 'll get to try many of their delicious items . note : i do not recommend the noodle soups , which are kind of bland and boring . but much of their menu can 't be matched by their competitors in town .
1	the food is still amazing and delivery time is not as long as it use to take before and that 's a plus for us .
1	might take a bit of time , but it 's made fresh to order so definitely worth it . lunch special is on til 3 so we miss the normal lunch rush hours & get faster sevice . not the super chic decor , but i 'm there for the food , not trendy vibe that doubles the prices .
1	we found something asian to eat and it 's very delicous keeping it within the asian vibe . ordered the hai nan chicken and roasted chicken and both was very delicous especially the sauces but their portion is small and came with water and drink was off though but okay . coming back next month again for more . wish portion can be bigger though .
1	it is very modern and clean . i usually go here for karaoke ~ server sehee is so sweet . she is very friendly and always gives good service ~ ! you wont be disappointed ~ !
1	i was never a fan of certain foods. mr. noodle man changed that for me. you have to try this place out !
1	must try . so worth it . try the tuna on crispy rice , lobster and truffle starter , and crab roll . awesome meal . the wagyu fried rice may be the best thing i 've ever had , well at least in the asian category . service was excellent .
1	this to be finished with a complementary coconut ice cream . will defiantly be back again and again .
1	aaaaaamaaaaaziiiiing celebrated my daughters 23rd and they really surprised us with a great birthday celebration for her apart from their grrrreeeaaat service
1	finally found a great chinese restaurant to order takeout from . they delivered quick and the food was spectacular . i moved to vegas 3 years ago and have been on the search for good chinese food and so thrilled i finally found it . the owner even called after delivery to see if the food had met our expectations and thanked us for our order . what restaurant does that nowadays ? we will be ordering again from them .
1	i 'm a vegas local and this is the spot good prices great sushi awesome staff ! ! !
1	although the portions are very small and you are so satisfied you actually feel full .
1	nobu is awesome . service was great as well . we ate several years ago at nobu atlantis and had a bad experience however decided to give nobu vegas a chance- boy are we glad that we did . had the yellowtail and ocean trout sashimis - so yummy . for hot dishes had the black cod with miso and ocean trout again . so delicious . weren 't that hungry since we had a late lunch at the pink taco also in hrh ( which was not good food ) so we were full after 2 cold and 2 hot and had to pass on the rolls which looked great .
1	i have been going here for about 3 years now and i 've never been disappointed . the service is always amazing and the food is delicious , not to mention cheap ! they know me by name and i even have my own chopsticks in house ! it is small and can get busy on fridays but i promise you it is worth the wait ! i recommend my favorite , the mexican roll ( tuna , cucumber , and habanero ) it 's spicy ! to cool things down billy super tuna ! give it a try , this place beats any other any day of the week .
1	we were with a party of 18 , and went with the signature selection menu . there was a vast selection of dim sum , plus four or five differnt entrees brought ou , plus noodles and veggie sides . every single thing was good . most things were memorable. the desserts were beautiful , and my college with a major sweet tooth claimed they were as tasty as they were pretty . he stopped sharing after breaking into the chocolate with raspberry dessert . i will make it a point to return to hakkasan for dinner whenever i am in vegas . high value for the money spent .
1	this place is so good , it 's a mix of all the best things in one place . i 've become obsessed with their pork belly baos , ramen , and katsu . every time i travel to las vegas i have to stop here even if it 's just for a snack . i think it has the best pork belly i 've ever had and wish there was one closer to us , but probably good i don 't since i wound prob be an additional 300lbs . the service is always amazing and quick . i would highly recommend this place for anyone wanting a food " simple " meal .
1	just be careful on your spice level ... we 've learned the hard way to go with a 2-3 level ! i highly recommend the chicken tom khar soup , crying tiger salad , red curry and drunken noodles . yum !
1	my husband and i have been coming here for years now . never a disappointment . everyone i bring here with me becomes a lover . i always get the ll you can eat and the variety of sushi and appetizers is amazing . i recommend the tiger yamasaki roll or the matsuri roll .
1	mom & pop place . guess where they are originally from ? best cambodian in toronto ! ! i love this little place . they friendly , attentive people . eat in or take out . when i moved into hood about 16 years ago , i heard from a loyal customer a neighbour . was locally known secret then ... even since i tasted the food , hooked on this authentic food that never disappoints . try the soup tom yum goong and phanaeng kai chicken red curry with coconut milk and basil . very reasonable prices too . dishes might be on spicy side for some-but i like .
1	see my other reviews for details . i noticed there is an ad for a competitor on their page here . i 've been to that place . it 's not worth the money and the food is not as good . just come to zaytoon .
1	we ordered king crabs and lobsters . omg they were so good
1	always good stuff coming out of here . prices a little high though .
1	if you like american made , watered down , trendy sushi then dont stop here . larry , and leo make damn good sushi and im a food snob ! ( read my reviews ) we have taken so many out of towners there and they all leave very happy ! these reviews blow me away , and wtf ! ! ! ! drop by and tell larry what flavors you like and watch him make magic . booooo hoooo there is a little clutter . the place has a a rating and bomb sushi . check em ' out ..
1	very unique menu with all kinds of japanese options and an extensive drink menu . can 't wait to come back for more
1	will come back soley to chill at the bar and enjoy his personality
1	you can not beat the $ 5.00 everything menu . sashimi and sushi and appetizers and drinks and beers .... so amaze ! ! ! !
1	it helps that diego really knows how to entertain his guests . sunday nights here are just perfect for unwinding . awesome environment and atmosphere . murderous happy hour . make it a ritual , like me : )
1	the staff is always extremely friendly and try their best to make sure the guests are always satisfied with their meals . their lunch specials are amazing , also . you get your choice of a soup and an entree for a very fair price . or in other words , i recommend going for lunch instead of for dinner . always call for the times of the special , though , as they might have changed .
1	they have the best hot and sour soup i 've ever tasted . eggrolls are awesome too . i 've tried many things on the menu and have never been disapointed . i can 't comment on the table service because i always get take-out but the cashier has always been very nice . be sure to ask for thier special mustard , it 's awesome too .
1	unfortunately i have to have dinner by my own tonight ....... it was perfectly made with reasonable price . highly recommended .
1	a bao time is amazing - their food is incredibly tasty and they worked around my gluten allergy to make something i could eat- i had the pork belly baos ( sans bun ) on a bed of cabbage and it was amazing - really nice guys , really great service , really good food !
1	they have private karaoke rooms and their menu selections for drinks and food are great . sapporo draft was the best .
1	the food choices are fantastic done perfectly our wait person greg did a fabulous job guided us through the varied menu and delivering the food quickly and efficiently . the food was terrific
1	well worth the drive to leave the strip and enjoy a higher quality experience without the insulting prices . as others have mentioned , the black cod is buttery smooth and perfectly cooked . all the flavors are on point . i recommend the truffle oil edamame and the scallops -- enjoy the scallops , then mix the rice in the remaining sauce and drizzle the extra truffle oil from the edamame appetizer over the top . the flavors are well balanced and a hint of spice is used to excellent effect .
1	i got there early ( soon after they opened for dinner ) , and i had no trouble getting served . the wait staff was fantastic--responsive and seeming very put together . the menu was extensive , though a bit confusing for being organized mainly on the basis of meat used rather than type of food ( curry / noodles / stir fry ) . i tried the chicken green curry , and it was delicious .
1	i had the pleasure of tasting the " street " essence of the fried and soy sauce style attributed to asian wok noodles . i loved how my order came out in 5mins but tasted like it had taken 5000 years of culinary experimentation to master . the juicy and crunchy beansprouts by the side served as a great palette cleanser , to reignite the noodle 's taste after every 1 to 2 mouthfuls . licious .
1	chang 's has an awesome happy hour . nice bar , good drinks and excellent appetizers . plenty of tv 's at the bar if you wanna catch a game !
1	the panang avocado flavor blew us away . potstickers with 3 sauces are a good pick . shrimp pad thai is the best we 've had in vegas . prices ? cheap ! beer and wine license is in the works . you can bring your own bottle if you buy it have the receipt with you .
1	trendy atmosphere , great background music and personable service . the food was excellent . lunch specials for $ 7.95 do not disappoint . the sushi is fresh and delicious . nothing bad to say about this place . highly recommend !
1	i guess technically what i ordered wasn 't pho , but it was a big bowl of awesome . i had the # 12 - seafood vermicelli soup and i also ordered some vegetarian rolls to share . both were delicious . the restaurant is small and the servers are prompt . i love ben thanh , but this place is better i 'm afraid .
1	the eponymous ramen is the way to go . if a restaurant names a dish after itself , you order that dish ! and it doesn 't disappoint , delicious chashu , perfect egg yolk , and by adding just a little white pepper , the salt broth is as good as i 've found in vegas . i hate carrying punch cards but make two exceptions : fukumimi and buddha belly deli . the karaage is great here too and you get a free one with every 4 ramen bowls . see you there .
1	service was good and friendly . food came promptly . stopped in on good friday heading to mass and split shrimp fried rice with my wife . very tasty . the addition of bean sprouts was a great taste and texture addition . sorry we didn 't know about this place sooner . we will be back .
1	i know i will miss having this place around . we loved coming to this restaurant and am so sad to see you close yesterday . i am really picky about my chinese food and buffets don 't do it for me . this was at the top of my list for chinese food and you could tell the owner put a lot of tlc in this place . if you missed going to this place i feel bad for you . it was a little average for decor but very clean and the food had a personality all it 's own . please let us know when you decide to open up again .
1	our soccer team went here for lunch after a game .... 40 people walking in the middle of lunch hour is no easy feat and you guys handled it like pros ! the food was great and service fantastic ..... thank you !
1	the food was really good and fresh . i like the seaweed salad . prices are typical for all ypu can eat sushi places . the sashimi was fresh not fishy . we come here a few times a month so yes we like it .
1	their sushi is great but their other items are sort of so-so . they bring you a sample platter with their specialty sushi at the start and explained each one of them to us , it was a great touch and they were all delicious ! the service is great and the food comes ridiculously fast when you send your order into the kitchen via the provided ipad .
1	* very nice dining enviroment . * decent menu and delicious food . * will try tennpanyaki next time , my kids are so looking forward to it .
1	a bit hectic but they have great customer service and their food is pretty good : ) it 's really clean in here as well and it tends to get pretty busy .
1	everything has been wonderful and freakishly quick . they are also very nice . i think they have the best pad thai and pad see ew on campus !
1	small place but the service was great and the food was also delicious .
1	yummy , affordable , comfort food . all of the banchan was tasty . we got the whole fried chicken , bulgogi kimbap , ramen , dokbokki , yukgaejang , and julmyun . and they had a special buy 2 drinks get one free . we thoroughly enjoyed it ! great for a large group ( we had a party of 8 ) .
1	best pho ever ! kind and fast service with great food ! open 24 hrs and near the strip . even if you are not into pho , they have great selection of different varieties . liked this place so much ate here twice during the same vegas trip .
1	the pad thai is amazing , as is the pumpkin curry . the food is fresh and flavorful , and reasonably priced . plus they make everything to your desired spice level . service is friendly and efficient . the restaurant is clean and decorated in a cheery and authentic thai style , with thai costumes adorning the walls . light lavender shades of cheerful go hand-in-hand with the service with a smile you will find at cha da thai . the thai iced coffee is delicious . i will definitely be back !
1	wife took me to this place for my birthday . nice atmosphere , friendly staff , great food ! best birthday dinner ever !
1	we came for lunch on a weekday . there was no wait , staff was helpful and attentive . the food warrants a 4 star rating , but the service took it to the 5 stars . one of our three dishes took a long time to come out . while we noticed , we didn 't say anything . the manager came out to acknowledge the delay , apologized , and brought us a very yummy dessert . great experience ! these guys care about their food and service !
1	the delicious food , friendly service , and wide variety way compensates for size . good things do come in small packages .
1	the wait staff was extremely friendly and willing to work with us considering that most of my family did not try hawaiin cuisine . although i can 't confirm the authenticity of the meal to hawaiin cuisine , the meal was extremely satisfying and tasty . i ordered the fresh made ahi poke plate with spicy mayo and avocados , and i can safely say that it was phenomenal . the cubes of tuna melted in my mouth leaving the umami of their shoyu and spicy mayo on my tongue . mahalo .
1	i got the hawaiian poke bowl . fresh , filling , and delicious . a bunch of tuna with great veggies and not a ton of rice . not assembly line poke , but made for me . you could taste the difference . this is not a poke place , rather it 's a seafood market with great poke . fresh fish in phoenix to go , it 's a beautiful thing . they had 8 different seafood options in the case , and they looked great . i 'll be back tomorrow to bring some fillets home . really nice people running this spot to book .
1	rice was slightly undercooked on sushi but am gonna assume that was a fluke . the bulgogi and katsu were great .
1	my friends and i absolutely love the crunchy crab roll . to die for ! i could go there 4 times a week ! this is one of my favorite restaurants in charlotte .
1	there location is pretty bad and easy to miss but if your on the stip and especially staying at bally 's make this a place to not miss .
1	they added onions when we asked for none ; but they quickly made a new dish for us . friendly and awesome service !
1	the food is excellent with a large selection to choose from ... appetizers , soups , salads , chefs specials ... a 12 on a scale of 1 to 10 ! we started with chicken satay appetizer followed with deep fried chilean sea bass for grace and a combo pad thai for me ... both dishes were excellent ! gotta try this one if you like thai food ... the staff is first class also !
1	if you order little or half sugar you can appreciate the real taste of the tea . boba is amazing !
1	don 't wear long sleeves or nice clothing , since you may get food on it although they gave you plastic gloves and napkins . the medium spicy was really spicy . my friend and i ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of mussels , so it didn 't cost that much . but , we still needed to get desserts after ...
1	subtle , delicately balanced dishes with wonderful flavors , and attentive service . great decor .
1	after my bf introduced me to this place i can no longer eat shrimp fried rice anywhere else in the valley , compared to sd , everything else is simply gross love super dragon and the workers
1	not listed on the menu but just ask . i had the gf pad sew ew and it was delicious . i 'll be back !
1	always order # 15 when i go there . nothing better than hot soup in a cold day .
1	great central location and view from ceasar 's palace ! i had sushi while my daughter had the ramen bowl . now , we have been to japan before and this ramen bowl was better than the ramen that we had in japan itself . the food also came out varily quickly which surprised both my daughter and i. wonderful place and i would very much recommend if you want sushi on the strip .
1	abolutely love this place. the owners are the guys serving you so you know your going to get something great. only complaint is the shumai isnt really traditional , more of a frozen out of the box type. either way highly reputable. small place in the mddle of nowhere and kinda easy to miss if you dony know where to look. some outdoor seating should be added possibly , but other than that very nice place and food is fantastic
1	pink diablo sauce was really good . both of girls loved their food . wife tried all dishes and liked them all . service was great . if you looking for great authentic italian pasta this is your place .
1	first went to shanghai . they were opened and opened 20 mins late with no food so we left came here . they were open early too . it amazing ! food was amazing . so many options ! i loved it ! lunch is 9.99 per person ! amazing loved it . def will come back !
1	i will definitely come back with some of my clients who are looking for amazing sushi close to their new home ! !
1	if youre a curry kinda person . this place is for you ! you can add extra items into your dish , spice or no spice . curry mixed in or on the side . basically curry the way you want it . thank goodness they opened one up in the sw area . so convenient . quick friendly service . and since it 's express style versus the restaurant they serve their food is sturdy tupperware like bowls . which in my eyes is another plus , cause i can save it ! lol .
1	just know that it is a simple restaurant ( nothing fancy about the atmosphere but it 's nice , clean and friendly for sure . ) the owner / chef is engaging , funny , informative and more than happy to make recommendations if you 'd like . or if you 'd like to be adventurous you could order all kinds of dosas , biryanis , curries and naans from their vast menu and enjoy every bit of it ! must try this place for yourself .
1	we ordered a lot of sake and a lot of dishes . the standouts were the crispy broccoli , the beef satay , the coconut shrimp , the house salmon and chicken wings . the edamame were messy to eat . that was my only complaint . but they still tasted good .
1	they always seem to be open too . there 's korean beer posters and autographs written all over the walls and a separate room for events . i 've gotten so much at this point , i can 't list everything i 've had , but the tofu appetizer , the bibimbap are very good . i highly recommend korea house .
1	what the hell is that doing here ? ? ? , " real sushi made fresh , mongolian bbq , a nice full bar , decor that 's modern , sleek and clean combined with friendly and efficient service-- all for less than $ 10 at lunch . i 'm in centpho but still think it 's worth the drive .
1	i 've had better crab legs at captain george franchises but the sheer quantity and quality of all the food is impressive . there is something for everyone . i was full and was dumbfounded when i found out there was another 2 sections in the back with asian style food ! quick tip . if there is a long wait , grab some strangers and form a group . there is a separate line for large parties and my group got in almost immediately .
1	you sit down , there 's a piece of paper , you flip through the menu and decide what you want , you write that number on the piece of paper , boom . the waiter / waitress won 't even come over until you have menu closed . tea is served complimentary and the food is brought to you quickly . i had the chicken curry and a jackfruit shake . so good . this place is awesome , just keep in mind they only take cash . i definitely recommend this place .
1	in cleveland there are about three cambodian restaurants and all of them are really delicious . phnom penh in ohio city is a quiet and simple place with attentive service , comfortable seating , and wonderful flavors . i 've been here three times now and it never disappoints . the only difficulty is the menu is large and the names are tongue twisters for most of us . read the descriptions and you should be fine . ps the soups are declicious and tasty and very large .
1	this coconut milk , yellow curry , noodles dish with choice of braised beef or other ( of which we don 't even consider besides beef because of how good it is ) is simply amazing . best of all is how they handled it for delivery . i didn 't think they would do a good job of taking care of this dish but they even separated the cooked noodle and dried noodle with the beef and curry in another dish . this is love love and attention to detail ! do not hesitate to order delivery from this location .. top notch food .
1	we sat at one of the teppanyaki tables and really enjoyed the entertainment . i had the sukiyaki with japanese fried rice and it was very enjoyable . the veggies were crisp , hot and cooked to perfection . even the miso soup had so much depth and flavour . the restaurant sees a lot of business so i would really recommend making a reservation . it 's also very affordable for the experience / quality received .
1	ming 's is by far the best in the area that i have had . i have tried a few of their dishes but my staples are crab rangoon ( they have the best sweet and sour sauce i have ever had ) and pad thai mei fun . it is consistently good every time i eat there .
1	one particular time , they were a bit busy , and paul himself delivered ... incredibly friendly , and certainly appreciative of the business ! the food is great ... i can 't compliment it higher !
1	service is amazing and boy do they feed you ! ! hidden gem in markham !
1	service started out a little slow , but once things got going the angels started singing ...... tried several things so i would have leftovers to take home and i am glad i did ... the panang curry was fabuloso and the pad thai great and the papaya salad great but maybe a little spicier than i had hoped but still great ! ! go there or have them deliver to your hotel great value ! ! !
1	the interior feels like a cheap chinese restaurant with poor countryside chinamen that man the booth . the broth tastes good and tastes more or less what i expect it to taste like . the hand pulled noodles are chewy ( this is how noodles should taste ) and matches the noodle soup perfectly without making it ever being soft and soggy . the pig ears were also plentiful and packed into a nice small hill . the price is a bit more than what i am used to , but it 's a great restaurant and i will return again .
1	my wife gets the pho . i get the vermicelli noodles with pork and egg rolls . and an egg drop soup ( egg flower soup ) . we also like the summer rolls and chicken lettuce wraps . the food is served fresh with excellent service and nice people . we typically get takeout but it is a nice place to eat in as well . i hope for many years of success for them as they are a terrific local establishment with excellent chinese cuisine !
1	their adobo fried rice is always a recommendation among the locals . but my personal favorite here is the chicken curry and spicy chicken and gravy with custom topping of fried eggs . but u can 't go wrong with anything else that 's on their menu . place can get busy at times since its next to unlv . i always go here for breakfast so crowds or lines are never an issue
1	i left my wallet on the women 's restroom counter and called 5 hours later . an employee had found it , turned it in and even refused a tip when i came back the next day to claim it . i wish they were in charlotte . whenever i 'm on i85 i will give them my business !
1	love all the dishes that i ordered . crispy fried fish skin is an asset ! i love the black pepper soup so much !
1	best ever ramen .. tried the spicy miso bowl along with chicken karaage .. the thin wavy noodles are so fresh and melts in your mouth ! a definite soul food prepared with so much love !
1	this is the best ramen i 've had outside of japan .
1	i came here with family on a trip to visit a friend . we ordered the instant spicy steampot and boiled fish . we ended up with giant pots of this delicious ( and really spicy ) pot full of goodies and really authentic sichuan style boiled fish ( 水煮鱼 ) . the patrons are mostly chinese ( which is how you know it 's really authentic ) . you can choose the level of spicy - we tried regular , and trust me , it 's not for the light of heart .
1	this sushi place is new , clean and the food tastes very fresh . they also provide complimentary salads and soups and even mini hand rolls when you order . the server made sure we were full before we left . we will be back for sure ! ! thank you !
1	a broad selection with special items like lamb chops , sweet shrimp and scallop sashimi , and duck breast
1	let me say that i am a total meat eater but i went with my girlfriend last night to try it out ( she 's the vegetarian ) and i ordered the soy kung pow chicken . so good ! i tasted no difference , we also ordered their lemonade , once again so good ! the service was outstanding for a packed house ! i will totally be returning
1	happy hour all day ? cant beat that ! great sushi , great service and groovy music !
1	i came by three times this week and the taste was the same . the spicy ramen was not too spicy and had awesome flavor . some of the workers are really kind and attentive . the chicken curry was really good too ! have yet to try the boba , but will do the next time i stop in .
1	i 'm here at least once a month if not more . happy hour is reasonable . you get high quality fish for what you are paying . rolls are different than your standard roll you find everywhere . if you want something customized they will do it without any issues . for drinks the spicy suno mono is fantastic .
1	my favorite one if i want to taste food like home made . they might not offer fancy dishes that you can usually get in large chinese restaurant , but you can find good dishes like steamed chicken , steamed fish , pork chop with soy bean , duck etc . i like going there after evening classes . the owners are very nice and i can call to preorder my food . when i arrive , the food are ready in a minute . great price that no one can beat and the portion is large .
1	excellent service-- you can 't pay for service like best china has these days . huge portions ! ! we will definitely be coming here once a week ! !
1	the food is delicious and healthy - and very reasonably priced for the neighbourhood . the staff are absolutely wonderful - gloria will remember you if you go there often and will always be so happy to see you and welcome you there with such a friendly demeanour . the healthy , tasty food , gloria and the great prices are what keep me going back here . it 's located in the grange food court and isn 't visible from the street , so it remains a hidden gem in the downtown area . if you 're nearby , definitely go !
1	my personal favourite is the mi tom bo sate , it has a kick of spice if you enjoy it you must try .
1	huge servings for a great price ! so many options , the whole family will love it ! ! it 's my kids favorite place to eat ! ! i 've been eating here for years , and will continue to do so ! and they deliver ! ! winning !
1	tony is a fantastic sushi chef , and an extremely nice guy , to boot . he is definitely the reason my wife and i come back so often , but the variety and quality of the buffet is great , too .
1	i 'm not from cleveland , but in my travels up and down the east coast and in the midwest , this is by far one of the best sushi bars i have been to . the ambiance was perfect for the basement bar , and the service was absolutely amazing . they were attentive to my every need and made me comfortable in my wait for the sushi . i will definitely revisit this place on my travels through cleveland again .
1	fresh and flavorful . service is adequate and atmosphere ok--you are in a corner of a gourmet grocery store . miso soup is to die for and the sushi rice perfectly cooked . all fish is expertly handled and seasonings / sauces perfect . the spicy tuna roll really stands out--there is a mix of different chilis that combine to create perfect heat and flavor . highly recommended but get there early . they fill up and don 't take reservations .
1	the best service ever , ran by one waitress . she 's always amazing as well as the food . this is the only sushi place i frequent and their consistency is remarkable . do yourself a favour and try them out , before people find out and they get real busy . already , i 've seen them go from barely able to fill the tiny place , to constantly being full . really proud of them . the prices are also so fair so i always end up tipping really nicely because i can 't believe how perfect everything is . the reviews don 't lie ! give sushi zone a go
1	we come here often ! favorite rolls are " what the heck " and " screaming roll ... " love the atmosphere . love the house music and vibe of this restaurant ! family owned and friendly staff !
1	the soups , curries and stir frys are to die for . i love their fried rice . lotus of siam has got nothing on this place . everything is fresh . the curry duck is the best but its carried fresh only so you might need to call in advance to reserve your duck , but its worth it . david wongs pan asia puts all the other " supposed thai restaurants " in vegas to shame . the flavor and use of real spice is phenomenal .
1	the service is great and the staff is always friendly and welcoming . a couple of my go-to items from the menu are the barbecued spare ribs , beef and broccoli , orange chicken , and the geisha roll . i would highly recommend !
1	be mindful that usually there is only one server , an older female , and that service is slow , but it is definitely worth the patience . the portions are moderately-sized , but it 's difficult to have leftovers due to its deliciousness .
1	the egg rolls are the best i 've ever had as well .. not too heavy like other places
1	visited 3 times and loved it every time . no shortage of options , everyone will find something they like . best experience is at the bar where you can banter with the chefs . meat-less , rice-less , fried , raw , saucy , plain , all kinds of options and everything is good . kiss of fire , bam bam , sushi nachos , screaming orgasm , who 's your momma , and more and more .
1	they have a great chicken salad and the barbequed chicken i to die for . !
1	i 've been to many vietnamese restaurants and this one is the best ! service is always great , the atmosphere is wonderful , and nothing on the menu will disappoint you . make sure you come hungry ! the portions for pho are big . my favorite pho is the # 9 , tonkanoise . lots of beef flank steak , full of mixed veggies , absolutely perfect !
1	everything i 've ever eaten was good .. no complaints here .
1	highest quality food , breath-taking presentation . the staff is very knowledgeable about sake and is very happy to help you make the perfect selection . the place is just bomb . i 'll be the one dancing in the corner to the softly playing techno music with hamachi hanging out my mouth .
1	i 'm not even a vegan but i am a foodie and appreciate excellent food . i go here every time i am in charlotte , great for every meal ! my all time favorite is the tomato tart and sweet potato sushi roll , but honestly you can 't go wrong with anything !
1	it 's within walking distance from my aunt house . i love the tootsie roll they have . i chose the bento holic with the beer teriyaki , spicy crab roll , and crab puff . could never get enough sushi .
1	me and my boyfriend really enjoy going here . great atmosphere and yummy sushi ! rolls are big and leaves us full and satisfied !
1	absolute favorite thai place in the burgh. affordable and very friendly staff. hawaiian fried rice is my personal favorite , but you cannot go wrong with any of the noodle dishes , byob for a dollar a glass
1	reminds me of california . does door dash . reasonably priced and fills you up . awesome for lunch . korean mexican fusion .
1	when i say fiyahhh , i actually mean the food is insanely delicious and the hot sauce will make you sweat buckets . my go to 's are the large jerk chicken dinner and goat roti . seriously , can 't go wrong . if you 're a vegetarian , they got potato curry roti . also dope af and less than $ 6 compared to + $ 11 for goat roti . hot sauce for 25 cents if you order it to go and free for dine in .
1	the food is so tasty and delicious , service is really friendly and the prices are low . this is a nice quiet place at dinner time - probably more busy on buffet hours .
1	the prices are outstanding and the portions are very large . i 'm most impressed by the quality of salmon they offer , i 've been to asia many times and the salmon offered at heart sushi are not only large portions but so tender ! the rolls are very large and the prices are so affordable , the service is always great and highly tend to your needs . i do reccomend to go for the a la carte menu over the buffet , as unless youre starving you won 't have to order many times . the only thing i have an issue with is the tuna , tends to taste off and served warm .
1	service : friendly food : try the faux chicken wings ( i crave this ) kung pao noodles vegan chilli fries ambiance - a + tip : don 't order the faux chicken wings togo . soggy experience plus they add the carrots , cucumber , celery in the box and close it . equals the case of raw cooked veggies . go next door to nami for dessert ! !
1	come to this place to get a break from all the bland buffet food available on the strip . the szechuan beef noodle soup is absolutely delicious ! not quite as good as what i can get in taiwan - but comes pretty close . the pineapple seafood fried rice is pretty tasty also . i definitely recommend this place for anyone who can appreciate good , authentic chinese food .
1	scary interior , dirty water glasses , poor service , but food to die for ! try their eggplant and squash curries . btw , the food is pretty spicy , so watch out .
1	the food was absolutely fantastic . flavors were very authentic . good spice . excellent rice , tender chicken . what i loved more than the food was the service . felt like i went into someone 's home . the owner - i presume- took my order then said ok , give me five minutes and sprinted to the back . i was left there hanging with the credit card in my hand . left wondering how i should pay , i hear- sit , sit , grab a drink , just pay after you eat . boy did i enjoy . delicious .
1	i 'm fascinated with high end eateries and this place is not only affordable in the scope of high end restaurants , it 's absolutely the best prepared and thought out place to eat , period. the food is so good , i had to ask chef simon to come out and thank him personally for the great detail and thoughtfulness him and his team put into every dish . i 'm not kidding , try this place and you will be hooked , guaranteed !
1	the cocktails were incredible also . we sat in one of the basket type booths i loved the whole experience here !
1	the happy hour menu is by far the best i have seen in las vegas . great sushi rolls and sashimi dishes for just $ 5 . sapporo draft beer for only $ 3 . outstanding dishes we tried were the cajun albacore sashimi , salmon carpaccio , salmon avocado creme , fire cracker rool , and seafood dynamite roll . the counter service was super friendly and it was fun to watch the guys do their craft . we should have tried this place much sooner . can 't wait to go back for dinner service . if you are visiting from out of town get off the strip and run to this place .
1	sushi is high quality and very fresh . came in for happy hour today and was very impressed . had various nigiri sushi and a salmon skin salad . the rolls i had were excellent and they were fine with adjusting order to avoid mayo allergies . service was reasonably paced and extremely friendly . can 't wait to come back to scottsdale next time to try some other things . best of luck , you 're off to a good start .
1	you are treated just as if you are family . frequent customers are remembered and don 't even need to place an order , the lang van staff already know what you want . the food is incredible , the staff and personal table services are far beyond excellent , what else can i say ? , this place is a hidden gem . from appetizer to dessert , this restaurant 's cuisine and dining experience is one that i would highly recommend .
1	the uniqueness of each type of torta makes the menu enough to entertain my pallet no matter what my mood . i recommend their aguas frescas as well . : )
1	we drove all across town because of the great reviews and because i wanted something special for my birthday. the food was excellent , all really fresh and prepared with a lot of skill and love. outstanding service . our server was a real sweethearts , after she heard that it was my birthday , she brought out a cup with delicious ice cream and a candle on top and sang happy birthday to me , all the other guest joined in and i was as happy as i could be ! what a great experience .
1	friendly service . great ramen and food ! it reminded me of japan !
1	we had a party of 8 and decided on the personalized chef 's choice menu . the total cost per person at the end including a bottle of saki was about $ 70 per person but it was so worth it . each plate that came out was better than the last . i felt like we were judges on top chef . presentation was gorgeous and service top notch . i would highly recommend this place to anyone planning a vegas dinner .
1	as mentioned by others pho is the perfect cure all and you can 't go wrong with being open 24 hours . my husband and i go here all the time and it 's definitely our go to place when people visit from out of town .
1	my friend and i got the spicy yellowtail roll , tuna tartare , and bulgogi mushroom pot . the pot was more than enough for two . the tuna tartare came with a quail egg and asian pear . it was good , the atmosphere was nice , and we came after a jiujitsu class so we enthusiastically devoured it all . very satisfying ! i also totally want their cat-themed soy sauce containers !
1	the food has such savory taste , slightly pricey for a normal korean restaurant but it is definitely worth it ! highly recommended !
1	awesome vibe with some house music along with top notch sushi and great service . i will be back several times over .
1	parking can be a bit difficult in a crowded strip mall . but it 's well worth it for the spicy miso . there has never been a long wait . service is quick and friendly . asahi drafts are cheap and you better order the kimchee for an appetizer . every time i go i think that i will try something new . but every time the amazing spicy miso calls my name and i dig into a delicious bowl of awesomeness .
1	my personal favourite is the " hwaedobap " ( a beautiful mix of raw fish , rice , veggies and of course sweet and spicy red paste ) . have that with a side of beef kalbi and you are in heaven . the staff are quite nice and i like the design of the restaurant . perfect spot for a reasonable family lunch or dinner .
1	great food and service . we ordered kalbi combo and spicy seafood noodle ; both were delicious !
1	amazing indoor decoration style ! the service is nice and quick ! ! ! the food is amazing ! ! ! ! ! ! food per portion is small so you need order at least 3 dishes for one person accepting to the server . however small proportion prevent waste from happening . the combos looks great as well ! ( gonna try next time ! ! ! ) my family is so satisfied here ( even my picky brother looool ) definitely will be back ! ! !
1	some of the best service i 've ever received . the chef personally brought our meal to the table . the food was excellent and the plating was beautiful . all in all i 'll definitely be back . a little south west hidden gem .
1	my yelp fam was on point with this one . delicious , fresh , flavorful and healthy . what more can you ask for . had the small with 2 proteins . hawaiian tuna and scallops , skipped the mix ins , sweet chili and house dressing , seaweed and cucumber salad and crispy onion with sesame seeds . it was soooo good . i would highly recommend this place .
1	the service was a little slow , for it was a little crowded ( came at the end of lunch hour ) , but they recognized and accommodated . ordered all you can eat , and it was so worth it . definitely recommend .
1	a definite contender for best sushi in mississauga . their fire hand pressed sushi is certainly one that will keep u coming back for more . service was also excellent . overall a wonderful sushi experience .
1	after living in japan it is hard to find a good ramen place . this is the spot ! the spicy tonkatsu # 3 is my favorite . i will be seeking this place out anytime i am near one . unfortunately there isn 't one near where i live that compares . atmosphere is causal but very nice . service is great . and food is amazing ! sushi ida bit on the bland side but i don 't go for that . it 's called ramen house for a reason . i recommend it highly .
1	what a refreshing personalized experience that marcel provided for my son and i. we will absolutely be back ! ! !
1	i 've been going to this place for a couple years now and you just cannot beat the food here . i absolutely love the food here and the employees . can 't recommend this place enough for people looking for affordable , friendly , and good food .
1	as close to hawaii as you can possibly get in the middle of the desert . stopped in and grabbed some wasabi ahi and avocado ahi poke . bother were perfect . nice chunks of tuna and fantastic flavoring . extremely friendly counter service and helpful in the selection . should not be missed . may head back for dinner now .
1	attention to every detail in both taste and presentation . plus fair prices . far and away the best meal we had on our trip to vegas . salmon broil and black sesame pudding , mmmmmmm !
1	bang bang dumplings came out and serviced our office location for lunch & it was phenomenal ! the mango boba tea , pot stickers and fried rice was absolutely delicious ! we will be scheduling bang bang dumplings to come out and service our office on a regular basis !
1	beautiful quality , great presentation , excellent service . their sushi platters -out.of.this.world .
1	best thai food i 've ever had in the states . reasonably priced too and remarkable service .
1	the owner came over and gave us the best guidance i have ever received in a restaurant . he steered us away from some things ( stuff for the kids he thought would be too bland , and some of the more common dishes we always default to ) and towards some things we had never tried before and absolutely loved . he even talked us out of ordering far too much ! the service and food could not have been better and we hope to get back soon .
1	absolutely amazing. bulgolgi nachos , tacos , and tostadas and all we ate was amazing. ownership is super nice. they have dialed this in .
1	great flavor and all fresh ingredients ! and if you don 't love the amazing proprietor something is wrong . she is a doll .
1	i ordered a variety of pieces , and they were beyond delicious and beautiful ( and in some instances , creatively ! ) presented .
1	i don 't know what 's more impressive , the food or the service .. we 've been here on christmas day , birthdays , family get together and just because ... so much exquisite food to choose from .. make a point to come here for a really nice dinner .
1	i had just got my husband a chef from work and decided to take out . the dad " chef owner " was right this was the best sushi ever and service was great . will try new rolls soon.thank you all
1	everything i had tapa style was to die for . and that bread pudding with coconut ice cream . ohhhhh heaven in your mouth . so good . i 'll be back to this gem .
1	everything we had was delicious . if i were hosting , " the best thing i ever ate , " the juicy fried chicken would be on this show ! ! !
1	the service was incredible and dinner was phenomenal ! the yellowtail sashimi is outstanding for an appetizer and the scallops were delicious ! my favorite thing would have to be the house home made special sauces ! ! ! if you are in the area you must make a stop here ! you won 't regret it ! !
1	the food and service leave nothing to be desired . my masala dosa and my husband 's cheese dosa were delicious ! ! the chutneys and sambhar were freshly prepared and just the perfect level of spiciness . idlis were great too . the only item that was average was the gulab jamuns . overall , best south indian i have tried in the gta to date .
1	the food was very delicious and the service was awesome . we had an array of dishes and they were all very flavorful . i would definitely return to this establishment .
1	highly highly recommended . tepanyaki is delicious but found the cooks paid attention more to one side than the other . i would recommend going in and sitting and ordering a meal as its the best asian food i 've ever had in toronto .
1	if you don 't like loud music , don 't go here , but even if you don 't , its worth it to have the tuna nigiri ! !
1	try the red wave off the secret menu . our favorite date night spot . very intimate dining room .
1	they recently enlarged their place ! go early & often !
1	i have beeb to this restaurant twice . one for lunch buffet on a sunday and next time for dinner . the food is amazing for the price and the people are extremely friendly . best for indian students around the campus . go give it a try , you won 't regret it !
1	my first time here and the owner , i assume , was taking orders , serving customers , and cleaning tables . will definitely be making this my regular place for lunch .
1	searched yelp , and saw the great reviews . we got the lunch specials . dw fried rice , which had shrimp and chicken in it , as well as spicy red curry with shrimp . both were so flavorful . i have never had such good fried rice . the staff was super friendly , and the place is very clean and inviting .
1	i highly recommend the bowls and taro . try it !
1	definitely recommend it and will be returning multiple times in the future .
1	i love the street noodle 1 and 2 . the food is great and i love the spices they caution it is very hot and give you a choice 1-10 ive had up to 7 and for most that would be real hot i look forward to trying level 10 . if you dont like hit food stick to 4 or below . nice outside area and friendly staff . highly recommend this place .
1	best happy hour in town . definitely worth a try ! ! promise you 'll love it ! ! ! $ 5 appetizers from open to close ! ! ! you can 't beat this place ! !
1	absolutely amazing food & even better service , thank you vanessa for all of your excellent service , a + + + + !
1	every dish was so delicious and beautifully presented . i recommend sharing dishes so you can get all the flavors . we shared a soft shell crab steamed bun , pig face dumplings , short rib dumplings , kimchi fried rice ( i don 't even like kimchi but this was fantastic ) , pad thai ( sweet & spicy ) and zesty noodles . we would have ordered more if we could eat more . the staff was very nice and knowledgeable . fun atmosphere with large bar and open kitchen . worth every dollar . will definitely be coming back here .
1	everything we 've had has been wonderful . it 's our new go to place ! great value . can be really spicy so be warned .
1	great happy hour ! my husband said this is the some of the best food he has experienced . the experience alone is something to write home about . there is a grill at every table where you get to grill your own , already seasoned meats , korean style ! sooooo good ! i would definitely come back again . i will also be recommending this place to everyone i know who are visiting las vegas . thank you for a wonderful meal .
1	better than a lot of the curry houses in town . the place is clean and the staff is friendly . i watched a woman hand dry the dishes after they were washed one by one . it shows they care . please visit and enjoy !
1	i got the black cod miso and a type of chicken miso . i was not expecting such amazing flavors . definitely recommend this place .
1	i hated thai completely until i had this place. there seafood anything is awesome . i recommend there pad thai , there singapore noodles and their fried rice. the soups are amazing to . avoid the spring rolls as i didn 't care for them. but the entrées are simply amazing .
1	i love placing a to go order . staff is always so friendly and i will continue to order from here !
1	i recommend the papaya salad , garlic green beans , black pepper shrimp , beef chow fun and the lemongrass chicken . your experience is bound to be unique if justine , the owner is working . she is fabulous and memorable to say the least . the best part is it is byob so your check is reasonable . why haven 't you tried his place yet ?
1	food is always fresh , flavorful , and perfectly cooked . prices are very reasonable for bad food ... let alone delicious food ! the atmosphere inside is comfortable and the service is always pleasant . i have been going there for over a year and haven 't had a bad experience yet .
1	food is great ; what a great concept . the quality seemed to me to be as good as the expensive sushi restaurants . while there prices reasonable and there portions are on point a good size , they also are excellent quality . i would have taken a picture of my food but i just couldn 't stop myself from eating it long enough to take a pic . soooooo good ! !
1	it had been a long time since i had east coast chinese food , and this place doesn 't disappoint ! lunch specials are great as well with perfect portion sizes . staff always seemed friendly too . granted i never walked in with that east coast attitude , but hey . can 't go wrong here .
1	my girlfriend and i went to crazy crab and sushi . we had the garlic edamame , tootsie roll and finally the scrumptious vegas roll all super amazing quality and an excellent value . we have just found out new go to favorite sushi place . i wish i could give this place 6 stars . amazing ! ! ! !
1	service was superb ..... what else can one ask for ?
1	speedy service , clean and modern restaurant , friendly staff ! we are eating her for the second day in a row on our trip . delicious ! ! !
1	super friendly , family owned business . any time i 'm on this side of town i can 't help but stop in . i love the green curry fried rice and the thai coffee . can 't suggest this restaurant any higher !
1	the chicken is fantastic , you can make it as spicy as you want with their sauces ( which is good for those of us who love it burning ) . the rice is awesome . overall a great experience , i 'll be back !
1	the são paulo roll was probably the best roll we 've ever had . the gyoza with wagyu beef was also great . if you like sake they have a massive selection . the only negative was the noise level . the design of the restaurant makes it a bit hard to carry a conversation . doesn 't matter though because the food more than makes up for it .
1	def the best kbbq in vegas . this is now my go to spot & will be taking friends when they come to visit !
1	food was fresh , and tasty .... staff was awesome and made great suggestions ..... i definitely will come back here !
1	food was great ! great portions and the menu was very diverse ! the waiter and staff were great and the taste was out of this world . most importantly , they also have military discounts . highly recommend this place , specially during happy hour .
1	we love going to fresh mint . always good . we have tried numerous dishes and every time it just gets better and better . if you work around the area , their lunch specials are affordable and taste amazing as well . oh and if you want dessert , try their mango tapioca . wow wow wow ! oh and we aren 't vegetarians but fresh mint is just too good to not go to when we are in the scottsdale area .
1	you get a ton of food for extremely reasonable prices . service is great , always quick and always checks in to make sure we have everything we need . i tend to eat lunch here pretty frequently because it is a guaranteed great experience .
1	no msg with locally sourced veg and meats from notable dumas meats . something for everyone on the dual menu - i got asian this time . egg rolls are packed with chicken and 3 to an order . spicy noodles had subtle heat and great depth . my son 's chicken tenders and fries were a stand out in kids cuisine ! normally you get frozen planks but not here ! fresh cut fries and breast cut and dredged in a crunchy coating . one child eats free with each adult order on tuesdays ppl ! get here and steal your kids dinner ! ! !
1	fresh noodles made on the spot . perfect broth balance . can 't wait to come back . totally addictive from the first bite of al dente noodles .
1	hands down new favorite spot in champaign . how good is it ? well we went there for dinner and same night came back for the late night menu and the wings were just as delicious as the sushi rolls and the ramen we had earlier that evening . absolutely a must try .
1	gets busy fast , so get there early , definitely worth the wait . everything is super fresh , extremely flavorful and you leave very happy ! !
1	have ordered from here a bunch of times and never ever a disappointment . always big portions whether lunch or dinner . i would definetly recommend if looking for a great chinese spot in the southwest .
1	i am a vegetarian , my father is vegan and my mother and boyfriend are pescetarian . unfortunately , we discovered veggie house on the last day of our vacation . we enjoyed it so much we had it for lunch and dinner . we will most definitely be returning on our next trip to vegas .
1	i can 't think of one thing that could possibly fault the impeccable meal my partner and myself had tonight . the staff were perfect ; quick and super friendly , the food was the best i have had ( japanese ) ever and the whole atmosphere was great ! if you are in vegas and you want to have a perfect food experience then umiya is the place for you . if i could , i would travel from perth , western australia to vegas more often just to have this sushi . do not miss . * hint : have the all you can eat . will not disappoint .
1	i come here every friday , i have for the past 2 months and i 'm not going to stop . inviting atmosphere , friendly employees , great sushi and good prices . i really love how it 's so easy to unwind here after a long work week , this place makes me appreciate treating myself . great start to a weekend and the perfect environment to bring your family or friends . highly recommended . 5 stars .
1	i definitely recommend for a night out or a dinner date . great atmosphere and 100 % the freshest seafood .
1	i tried several incredible dishes that i wouldn 't have if i had just ordered from the menu . i was taken care of really well .. tried 8-9 types of dishes followed by an amazing line-up of dessert . i could hardly walk after eating for ~ 3 hours . amazing experience .
1	i had the chicken katsu bento with fried rice and was treated to the fluffiest , most delicious rice i 've ever had . the chicken ? amazing . perfectly cooked . this lunch made me a better person . thank you , teppan bento .
1	i had the dragon , spider and tarantula rolls . they were amazing . absolutely amazing , that 's all i can say . we sat at the bar and the bartender was extremely polite . i wish i were starting in charlotte longer , just to be able to go tob this restaurant again .
1	i had the logan poser ramen . it was perfectly spiced with the thai chilies . the pork belly and crispy pork in the ramen will haunt my dreams until i come back to vegas and have it again . also great service .
1	i had the pork bun & the ramen with black garlic oil , pork & thin noodles . the most amazing food i have ever had .
1	i had the shoyu ramen and shrimp dumplings and both were to die for . i currently live in the san francisco bay area with a very large asian population and authentic asian restaurants and i still prefer umami when i come back home . i prefer umami over the bay area restaurants any day ! !
1	i hope it sticks around . family owned and operated , can 't go wrong .
1	i know several friends who are absolutely crazy about this place , and with good reason . tons of items to select from all of them delicious . it 's always busy . i wish they had more seating because it 's a bit hard to simply drop by on a whim , and they only take reservations after midnight .
1	i love this place ! the staff is very friendly , prices are definitely decent . quality food / meats ( our favorite is the prime kalbi ) , very tasty curry , perfectly steamed rice , and the miso soup ! omg ! yum , such a wonderful delicate flavor ! ! ! i can 't wait until i can go back to try the ramen ! yay ! this restaurant is definitely a must try , you will not be disappointed !
1	it was like i was in chinatown in san fransisco . from 11 to 3 they serve everything on the menu and then after 3 they serve a shortened menu
1	absolutely amazing i usually don 't venture out and we went to a new restaurant and i got a new dish , capitol chicken it was truly amazing , wait staff is always there when you need them. would definitely go back !
1	i 've been coming every week because it is so delicious . the staff is so attentive , the food is amazingly fresh and the flavors are subtle yet delicious . and the presentation is amazing ! i love umi sushi !
1	i 've been craving mongolian bbq for awhile now and there really are limited options in vegas . regardless , came here based off of reviews the it lived up to the hype ! great service and great food ! everything is refilled in an expedited fashion . it wasn 't too busy so no issues with waiting in line . i 'd be curious to see how they 'd handle a busy situation ... but for us and for tonight , it was perfect . we 'll be back ! ! !
1	i 've been here five times and each time i 've left happy , the food is just really good . i do agree with the other reviewers that it can get crowded with a line . but it 's no surprise to me why that is . it 's is also priced well , not too expensive .
1	i 've been to : t & t , makimono , sushi mountain , edamame , and dragon roll in the ajax and pickering area . this place is by far the best a 10 / 10 . they are super friendly in person and over the phone . sushi is absolutely amazing . spicy salmon hand roll and maki to die for . i am beyond relieved that i found a sushi spot i can actually go to and enjoy .
1	i 've tried almost everything on the menu and have yet to find something i didn 't like ! the service is great and the food is perfect . i recommend the dumplings , which are made by hand by the owners and servers ; the tom yum soup , a hot and sour soup that is truly authentic and so full of flavor ; and the garlic shrimp , big juicy fresh shrimp tossed with sautéed onions and garlic with a very light white wine sauce . those are some of my favorites . i haven 't gone more than a week without eating here in probably 6 months !
1	absolutely amazing. i would definitely come back here again. i got the chicken cutlet curry. it was such an amazing time. also done forget to try the edamame .
1	i would definitely come here all the time if i lived here . the service was amazing and the panang curry was delicious . can 't say enough great things about this place ! !
1	it 's very authentic so be cautious if you 're sensitive to spicy food . the spicy chicken was delicious and the staff was very attentive and engaging . don 't be afraid to ask questions if the menu seems a little daunting . definitely advise people to give this place a try .
1	long line wait ( for 6 people though ) but so worth it . the host was very organized when seating tables . cannot say enough good things about the masaman curry , tasted just like thailand ! ended the meal with mango curry which was also delicious !
1	love the food and the dining environment , very unique menu and cuisine style , it 's one of a kind . was very happy to find that restaurant . if you want some nice seafood at affordable prices , i would definitely recommend this one .
1	super high end cooking table with many other offerings , impeccable service , great ambiance ... highly recommend for a date night , or a special occasion .
1	superb customer service ! ! very tasty soup and fried rice ! ! definitely will be back again ! !
1	my boyfriend and i order take out from this place at least once every 10 days and honestly every single time it 's amazing . the order is here so fast and the food is always so fresh and hot ! ! ! ! it makes me so happy that the quality is always so consistent . we just ordered and i swear i just had the best spring roll of my entire life ! ! ! ! keep it up ! ! ! !
1	my coworker and i were sent to phoenix for work and he suggested we try this place for dinner . i was a bit weary since i heard that the portions were small and the faire was somewhat pricey . although that is in fact the case , the quality , taste and overall ambiance of the place made it definitely worth it . we practically ordered everything off the menu and we left ( borderline ) uncomfortably stuffed . my three favourite dishes were the short rib & pork belly and softshell crab sandwiches and the grapefruit & hamachi . if only they had this restaurant in san diego ......
1	my wife and i regularly visit sushi muramoto , and there is a reason we keep returning : the food , and service , is outstanding . the kobe beef sashimi is incredible ! the lettuce wrap chicken appetizer is ridiculously delicious . the food is authentic japanese . what more could you ask for ? thank the gods for sushi muramoto ... !
1	never fails to make my taste buds happy . it 's called the d guy special . i come here every time just to have this roll . customer service is absolutely amazing as well . great staff ! ! !
1	nice intimate atmosphere , portions are good and the food is flavorful and delicious .
1	one of my all-time favourites . kyoto is an amazing no fluff sushi restaurant . they only serve authentic japanese dishes . their sushi is absolutely amazing , along with the plates such as the chicken teriyaki . i love their tempura shrimp and vegetables as well as the miso soup . the restaurant is small and cozy with cute decor . the service is impeccable . everything is incredibly fresh and delicious . one thing i would say though is that it takes quite some time to get your food . the sushi is hand-prepared in front of you by the owner so it takes quite long-but the wait is worth it !
1	one of my favorite places to eat in vegas ! the portions are huge , so come ready to eat your heart out !
1	ordered yellow chicken curry , short ribs , and lemon chicken . everything was cooked to perfection , will be returning very soon !
1	i have only ever ordered take out , but my order is always ready when i 'm told and the waitstaff is super friendly when i go to pick up my order .
1	spring rolls were also amazing . what i appreciated the most was how hot and fresh the food was . staff were very friendly and the decor of the restaurant was nice as well ! i think this is probably the best pho in markham .
1	cant comment on the other food but the pho was great . service was typical of most small asain restaraunts . will definetly come back !
1	flavored so perfectly you don 't need to add extra sriracha or hoisin sauce . they also provide plenty of rice ( asian approved ) and are so generous with their entree portions that i always have enough left to take for lunch the next day . the family that runs the place is so wonderful and nice : )
1	all of the staff was very friendly and had an answer for exert question i had . the fish was very fresh and made promptly after i ordered . great kids menu and awesome happy hour . will be returning very soon for more sushi and drinks
1	best sushi spot i 've been to in years . the fish was extremely fresh and masterfully cut , the service and people were wonderful . the sushi chef was extremely friendly and quietly smiled to himself as he prepared the fish . always great to see someone who sincerely enjoys their craft . long story short ; wonderfully decorated place with a welcoming staff and more than perfect food . i will most definitely be coming back and if you haven 't been there yet you 're missing out !
1	if u haven 't given it a chance yet , please do so . we went there while trying to find a thai place in this area of town and as soon as we walked in we weere hooked ! this might seem odd , but i feel like i get more shrimp in my pad thai when i dine in , rather than when i have food delivered or pixking it up . overall , i will be going back for a long long time ! ! ! !
1	reasonably priced , friendly / attentive service , and great food . don 't review much , but this was worth remembering my yelp login .
1	we actually originally showed up to a neighboring japanese restaurant but left due to the odd smell and unfriendly guests and employees . we wandered into sushi way randomlly and man were we impressed . the fish quality was fantastic ! thick slices of fish . great price with the all you can eat . me and my girlfriend must have sat there and ate for 6 people . the host / server was very nice and our sushi bar man juno was so nice . gave us his full attention , recommending dishes , making them promptly . we had some great food and will be coming back next time we 're in town .
1	absolutely amazing ramen , best i 've ever had !
1	kept a rowdy group of 14 guys silent for a whole meal . this is the real deal . everything is prepared for hours and hours and you can practically taste the effort that goes into it . not to mention the staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgable . this is my favorite place in tempe and i can 't wait to come back .
1	huge variety of food from sushi to steak , and large selection of fantastic drinks ! ! loved the godzilla drink , yummy ! ! ! you have to get the honey toast for dessert ! ! ! ! all the staff is awesome . super fun place with great entertainment . definitely a must go to ! ! ! !
1	salmon tostadas , tuna tostadas and black cod are fantastic . food is fresh , flavorful and carefully presented . the owner is a real gentleman and true craftsman . we dine here several time a week . what a find !
1	every attention to detail was noted and appreciated . will be back for sure .
1	i don 't have a single complaint . the restaurant is gorgeously decorated , the staff are very friendly and quick . the portions are huge and they come very quickly , no having to wait half an hour for your dish . all of the dishes are very reasonably priced , we ended up taking about half of what we ordered home because the portions were just too big .
1	i love the yang chow rice and anthonys special noodles . family style eating and generous portions .
1	our server was so great and helped us to decide what to order since it was our first time . he made us feel comfortable since we were clueless ! the pork roll and spring roll were both delicious ! we also had the chicken pho and fried rice ! everything was so flavorful and very authentic ! definitely worth the hour drive we made !
1	fresh wholesome roti and big glass of lassi ! usually i start with ambiance but food was mesmerizing so i broke my flow . decor was pretty cosy with dim lights . reminded me of old fashioned restaurants back home when everything didn 't use to be ' in your face ' ! service was impeccable with our host suggesting that we rather order one curry instead of two since it will be enough . i love the honesty . it shouldn 't be about selling food right ? wish we were staying close by . for an evening with ghazals on the rocks . will be back for sure !
1	such a nice group of workers ! delicious food ! the entire table is filled with food so it is definitely worth the price ! for $ 60 we could easily feed 4 people ! definitely recommend ! ! !
1	excellent customer service and sushi chefs . vivian was our server and did a phenomenal job ! super interactive with the guest and showed great customer service . happy we decided to stop here to eat today !
1	i 've been eating sushi for aboit 10 years , this place has the tastyest baked mussles , love the ginger which is fairly mild but with a perfect aftertaste that does not overpower and of course the ocean trout sashimi is absolutely to die for , best sashimi i 've ever had ! ! !
1	the staff was very friendly and attentive , the food came out in a reasonable time , and it tasted amazing . the rolls were well made and definitely work of art . beautifully made ! the price was also very reasonable .
1	definitely try the kiss of fire roll , my favorite . great staff , great service and the restaurant is beautiful . we came here every time we 're in town .
1	the owner and head chef makes this place one of the best in town .
1	they seem to have a small menu but they can make anything you want . i recommend trying the baked carb hand roll with cream cheese ! ! ! just may be the best sushi i 've ever had !
1	i can 't recommend a favorite dish because they are all equally as good . every time i go i am more impressed ! wish they would open more locations . totally recommend !
1	tasty , home-made noodles with spices to your desired level of heat . the lychee nut saki was delightful . we had the curry and noodle dishes . worth driving off the las vegas strip to have food nirvana experience !
1	i don 't normally like thai food , but this was awesome !
1	nothing compares ! everything i 've ordered has been great . most thai places do not make it spicy like i ask and they always spice it up for me !
1	the best hibachi we have ever had and the service was impeccable . we had the honor of tiger being our chef for the night and wow . the absolute best ! ! ! !
1	pho was perfect as well . very clean , welcoming , and overall our new hands-down favorite asian restaurant in charlotte !
1	the food is great , the service and presentation of the food is the best . probably the best sushi place i have ever been too , and i eat lots of sushi ! they have very classy food for a great price and that 's probably why they are always so full. the inside is very clean and modern . love this place
1	the food was beyond fantastic . charlotte , our bartender went above and beyond ! request her if you ever go there . she made our experience ! rio was great as well ! both were very attentive .
1	the food was great . service was wonderful . it was pretty busy too , which just means it 's good food ! will def be coming back for more ! !
1	their signature dish " spicy salmon tar tar " is my fav .. must try
1	the portions are huge ... larger than i 've ever seen in a korean bbq restaurant . every cut of meat is perfectly trimmed as well , with the perfect proportion of meat to fat for high flavor . the staff here is absolutely amazing as well ! our server was sharon and she was the bomb.com - so welcoming and fun . she definitely made our experience world class . bonus : they have macaron ice cream sandwiches . it 's like i 've died and went to heaven .
0	came here because we were staying at the graduate and , hey , this is so conveniently right next to the pool . ordered the shrimp tacos and smoked chicken tortilla soup , my bf ordered the butter lettuce salad and elote , although he 's dairy free so had to get both without cheese & dressing . his food was lackluster , mine was turrible . the tortillas were cold and brittle , as though they had just been pulled out of the bag . the " sweet chili " on the shrimp tasted like bottled sauce . the " soup " was a mystery mash of some kind of chile . i just don 't understand how you mess up tacos .
0	this is no different . seriously , i know life sucks when you work at a fast food restaurant at the airport . if you don 't want to work there , maybe you should find another job . it 's definitely not good for business when you have a sour look on your face while you point me to another cashier because you don 't feel like taking my order . i did get an extra piece of nugget . in your face .
0	1st trip very small portions , and the veggies were straight up burnt . 2nd trip no barbacoa . wtf , they are gonna have to get a manager to straighten this place up
0	i was like what excuse me was giving me an attitude and he said i thought you didnt speak english . there was more to it that happened they mest up on my order and i let the manager know . then she offered free food excuse me you wont shut me up with a cone ok . they should treat clients equal they will be talking yo my lawyer
0	this chilis location apparently does not practice healthy sanitation . i had a quesadila salad last friday night and within 2 hours was sick with food poisoning . beware !
0	won 't be coming back here again , drive to the next jack in the box .
0	deserves to close down . disgusting , run down , nasty restaurant ( not in a good way ) . makes you wait 1h30 for a dry mexi burger & fries ? ! complained to the hipster " manager " ( probably from the plateau ? ... ) didn 't make us pay a cent . definitely didn 't give a penny to our doofus , brain dead , pot smoking , " don 't give a f * * k " attitude , slob of a waiter ( not worthy of being called a server ) . never again . look at my pics of this disgusting place . stay away ... don 't bring your children ! 3 amigos is better than this .
0	0 stars. do not eat here. health hazard. employees working sick. that is a food health hazard. employees has pink eye and is at work ... you know he told his boss. stay away from here ...
0	horrible ! ! the worst location ever . we have been here several times and the service and food quality is unbelievable . how corporate hasn 't stepped in , i don 't know .
0	drive thru menus were not lit up making it impossible to read . ok minor detail i 'll just go inside . park and attempt to go inside and all doors are locked . it was 828pm . doors say 930pm and on apple maps says 11pm .
0	the cashier just made my food while the kitchen guy stood in the drive thru talking to some friends ; even walked up to the window while i was paying and asked her to make it . wow . great job guys . no wonder your business has 2 stars and never anyone in line . i won 't be back .
0	i ordered the brisket quesidillas and suffered 36 hours of horrific food poisoning after . all they did was refund my $ 11 bill and give me coupons to come back again . never !
0	the old man overcharges on every transaction . check your receipt . he overcharged the guy in front me $ 1 and the customer was very upset . and what do you know , he did the same to me . when i told him he took my credit card receipt and walked to the back . they laughed about a freakin $ 1 , the shop is breaking the law here . beware ! !
0	they make me select a star to finalize the rating . ordered nachos with chicken . while there was a lot of chicken - it was all dark meat and i think some gizzard type meat . worst airport food ever .
0	we asked how long it 'd take to get our food since we wanted to take it aboard the plane . the order took longer than the reported time . we then asked if it was possible to take what has been prepared to board the plane but the server / hostess made no effort to accommodate . we ended up forgoing the food to board our plane . this is our first time at this restaurant , and we had expected more based on the cost we paid ( for food we never received ) . we are very disappointed . we will never visit this restaurant again and highly recommend avoiding this restaurant .
0	was 4 cars when i pulled in ! ! wtf ? ? ? ?
0	literally any fish ' n chip shop in the u.k. will surpass this . the chips are not chips at all . precut garbage . i was so disappointed in gordon putting his name on this restaurant . i was at least expecting it be authentic , not the best i 've had but authentic . he didn 't even try . i know that sounds harsh but it 's true . and to top if off i never expected a gordon ramsey restaurant to serve me uncooked batter . soggy and goey .
0	we were ready to leave but , we wait just a bit more and after demanding the cup back from my wife for a refill that they ran out of so the last straw . i told the waiter we were leaving and i would pay for the pops thinking he would say don 't worry about it sorry for the delay . he ran a bill for the drinks and chips , glad i didn 't order a second basket . big zero in my book .
0	ref # 3781 i will never go back ever again to this place ! fish tacos is not good at all . seems you 're eating a grass and not enough fish and no taste whatsoeve ! i bought a menudo and it 's missing hominy ? i was advise by the cashier that i have to ask for it . i told her that i 'm going back to get the hominy and she called me right back and advise me that they 're ran out of hominyare you kidding me ! ! just ruined our dinner ! !
0	the service was about as lame as the prices . we had to go to taco bell afterward because we were still hungry . sad but true .
0	it 's the same as their weekday buffet they are just gouging you on a sunday
0	our bowl looked like it had already been eaten and was bland with no flavor . missing the lime and the spice ! they also pick the smallest avocados to use . our waiter was terrible and could care less , you would think he wasn 't working on tips ! ! ! ! attention barrio queen , increase the portion size of the guacamole or get smaller bowls so it doesn 't look so terrible !
0	it wasn 't once or twice ... but .. third time is a charm . these people always forget items whenever i order from here . i asked the moron at the drive-thru window if everything was in the bag ? .. and he just nodded his head . as soon as i looked in the bag my items weren 't in there .... again ! c 'mon this is just ridiculous . i 'm not going there anymore . i had to get out of my car and go inside to get my items . the manager was nonchalant about it .
0	overpriced . i go to sit outside on the patio at night to eat and enjoy the nice weather and one of the employees comes to the patio and lights a cigarette while straightening up the chairs so i then had smoke blowing towards me with the misters helping it blow my way . very unimpressed and very unprofessional for that to happen . won 't be returning .
0	wonderful . the food was good ; the service is horrible .
0	10pm on a super bowl sunday and they 're already closed ? ? weak , no wonder the hard rock is dying off ...
0	they 're meat is dry old refried beans i 'll pass .
0	apparently " the system is down " so we cannot order any food . we continue through and lo and behold , two employees sitting at a table eating , one of them being the one with the drive thru mic on his head . i was tempted to take a picture of them but to the peruse of my wife , did not . what good is 24-hour fast food when it 's not really 24-hour ? we ended up going to the gas station next door . during this 15 minute time period , we observed 6 cars going straight through the drive thru as well ... turn your lights off or something , geez .
0	a woman answered the phone and when i asked about it -- she replied with something i couldn 't hear . so i said i 'm sorry -- what ? and she hung up on me . i called back figuring i 'd give t a second try and after the phone rang a dozen times or more it went into voicemail . looks like i 'll go somewhere else that is more interested in their customers . how do these kinds of places stay in business ?
0	18 minute wait in drive thru . why ? more importantly , why no apology ? 2 . was told the restaurant had run out of chicken breasts once i finally got to the pay window . how does a chicken restaurant run out of chicken at 7 : 30 on a weeknight ? 3 . the " tell us about us number " printed on the receipt 877-375-4963 is not for epl . why ? when did the crazy chicken become the crazy circus ?
0	not sure why i got suckered into going here , but never again .
0	the " barracho burro " looks like canned meat . both my coworker and i have taken turns in the restroom all afternoon . i 'll stick to taco bell .
0	12 : 20 placed our order . 12 : 35 we had to ask for the complimentary chips . 12 : 50 megan our server stopped by the table to see if we " needed anything . " uh , yes , our food please . 1 : 10 after witnessing tables that were seated after us get served , we asked to have our food boxed to go as we had to return to work . 1 : 30 opened the take out boxes of food and found the most bland american-mexican food we had ever had . will not be returning .
0	eaten here 8-10 times before , it 's been up / down for food quality . when they make it fresh it 's pretty good ... maybe the customer should cook their own ! never again farmer boys ... innout 's not that far away , and i know that 's fresh cooked .
0	didn 't bother eating there as the service was poor ( even though we were one of two tables occupied ) and yelp rating was dismal . the place seems to be way overpriced for what it is .
0	we were really excited to try this place out , given the vegetarian and vegan options . the waitress- no explanation of menu was given . did not take take the time to review specials for drink and food , until we asked . took an amazing amount of time to realize the sangria drink was out . she walked by us multiple times without asking for our order . total of 25 minutes until we had a drink on the table and still missing one . the hostess super apologetic and sincere . perhaps we will try this place in the future .
0	the enchiladas weren 't even good , way to salty . served with rice and beans and the rice was ok , but the beans were not good . carne asada tacos $ 13.95 small portion and not that good . we will never go back .
0	plus , the quesadillas was super , super oily . i wouldn 't recommend this place .
0	chicken was also bland ( not enough seasoning ) . the santa fe fajita salad was the most disappointing mexican dish i 've ever had and the worst part is they call themselves " top " shelf . i took a few bites and told them i don 't want it . they didn 't hesitate to charge me for it though . the waitress was good with words but could care less about the customer satisfaction . i will never be back . no wonder the place was empty ! poorly run with lazy chefs .
0	i know the strip can be pricey but come on ! !
0	single car .. nuff said .. 5 soft tacos . outrageous .
0	15 minutes after i ordered in the drive thru my car hasn 't moved ... i think that pretty much is all you need to know for this review as i am writing in from the drive thru !
0	the new burger being advertised you can 't get in the drive thru for some reason . i am stuck in the drive thru !
0	walked out . this location has such terrible service . rather drive down to the one in tempe .
0	thanks for the free chips and salsa ! it seems that 1 star is too generous since i have nothing to base my review on other than stale chips and average tasting salsa .
0	one person working the line . they touch the meat and don 't change their gloves . cross contamination . slow terrible service .
0	i usually trust yelp but this place was horrible . the food was very blan and overcooked . i had a tamale and chili relleno combo with rice and beans . there was no texture to the food and everything had the same taste . i would head to frank and lupes for some decent mexican food . i will not be going back to los olivos .
0	2 workers . this chipotle is always busy , it 's on a college campus . i come here every thursday after yoga and it 's the same thing . it 's understaff . they need to hire more line workers , it 's not like they aren 't making money . least the food is yummy .
0	? i 've payed 16 $ for burrito that was disgusting . bartender was s cool guy , i 've ordered chicken fajita burrito and the guy told me straight that " kitchen " doesn 't wanna put papers and onions in the burrito , i can get it on the side .... wauuu ! ! ! really ? ? ? .... like a sad guy was cool so i sad ok , they can put it on the side . worst meal ever , chicken had no taste , rice was half frozen w no taste as well ..... beans were fine thats a plus . for the money i payed my meal was terrible !
0	meal was room temperature not hot . wondered why there were no drink prices on menu ............... $ 3.75 for lemonade or soda ! burrito flavor was okay but needed a magnifying glass to find the meat . won 't be returning .
0	need i say more . very expensive for tiny portions . not coming back .
0	effing dollars for 4 tacos and a drink ! ! ! ! never again ! ! the only reason they get one star is because at least the carne asada was good . the al pastor ? meh .
0	i had to add salt which i never do to any of my food after it 's been already prepared and the fries were super soggy ! plus the guy at the register was super rude and acted like he didn 't want to answer questions ! too busy watching tv . never coming back here again ! ! 0 stars !
0	nonexistent service . gtfo . run . save your money for the stadium ( i 'm assuming you 'd only come here because you 're going to a spring training game ; who would actually live this far from civilization ? ) . also , bring your flat brim monster hat to help with the overwhelmingly east county ( ca ) vibe .....
0	rice & beans were bland . meat was greasy with no seasoning . dirty bathrooms . yuck !
0	the sour cream tasted old and smelled weird . everything needed more salt . server kept forgetting what drinks we originally ordered . barely got checked on . dropped check and didn 't come back for quite a long time . food subpar . service subpar . yolanda is not a very good server . she needed to get it together .
0	i 'm disappointed because i live nearby . every experience here has been bad .
0	one manager in a back room and three on the grill . this place sucks to be considered fast .
0	do not order online 2 . the tortilla was burnt as hell 3 . the meat was very greasy & lettuce in my burrito ? ! where 's the rice ? ! i wouldn 't recommend eating here again
0	rather go to chipotle food is better and not so many up charges and their portions are big enough to make 2 meals out of it . will not be returning .
0	-1 for the handful of gnats hovering above our table -1 for the dingy smell inside the restaurant -1 for the dirty cloth napkins -2 for the awful tasting tacos ( " lobster " and chorizo con pappas ) * -1 for the practically virgin banana colada * lobster is in quotes because i highly doubt it was real lobster. it tasted more like what imitation krab is to real crab. oddly crunchy , chewy and trasparent. i would 've left if i were on my own , but i was with two friends that wanted to try it out and we had a groupon. personally , i never plan on setting foot in this place again. i want to gag just thinking about it !
0	happy hour pricing is only available in the upstairs area where they don 't allow anyone under 21 ( even though there is family friendly table seating ) or on the patio with the broken heater . 2 . food is not even that great . 3 . the indoor decor is outdated and run down . there are better spots in the area to eat . i recommend to skip this place all together .
0	soggy fries and cold pizza . delivery guy leaves the food on top of a damn trashcan and doesnt even hand it to me . ubering people when delivering . f 'd up ! 36 bucks down the drain
0	if you want mexican food , i strongly do not reccomend tortilla flats 2 . do you like mcdonalds ? you 'll love it here . 3 . frozen guacamole , my mexican grandma is turning in her grave 4 . never again
0	my carne asada was grilled , hard tortilla , dry , just nasty . 2 . i paid 5.50 for it ! : / 3 . salsa didn 't help much
0	one star for a good margarita . 2 . but the margaritas still aren 't good enough for me to ever come back again . worst mexican food ever . beans are just brown soup- i don 't know what the origin of this is .ground beef like taco bell meat . service - no .
0	i asked for my money back and took off .
0	the food was bland and , at the same time , odd tasting . the peppers and onions tasted like they had been slightly pickled . the chicken was dry and absolutely tasteless and the rice was just not good . the chips were heavy and tasted like they had been fried in old oil . ended up throwing this away and eating saltine crackers . the plating was also sloppy and unappetizing .
0	parking lot seemed packed which led me to believe that it was a good place to eat . 47 minutes later still sitting here waiting for food . waitress has to many tables and hasn 't been back by to check on us .
0	just paid 39.05 for me and my husband . the food seemed like it had been sitting all day. this place is by far hands down the worst possible place to eat at . seriously i think i will be sick . please don 't eat here ! ! edited 45min later-yup i 'm sick
0	back again , for more punishment . god i can 't wait for a better place to open nearby . there is nowhere else to go nearby so we have to come here out of lack of options . the customer service is the worst i have ever seen . food is good , patio is nice , service is atrocious ! how the servers will drop something off at one table and not even address the new table who just sat next to it is unbelievable ! horrible service !
0	it 's not the 1st time this has happened here . they have no regards to health regulations . when you ask for condiments , they give attitude . when asked if they have a discount for military , she rolled her eyes at me . they completely messed up my husbands order and we called them about it and they wouldn 't even apologize . they didn 't even offer to fix it . that 's ok because i will be in touch with corporate about everything .
0	every single time i 've been to this location it 's a true test of my patience . i just waited a half an hour to pick up an online order that i arrived on time to pick up . i could go on but i can 't relive what i just went through .
0	i just now went thru drive thru & guy said to wait a min . no 1 in line i waited forever ! ! ! drove thru & left . they have no customers wth ! ? ! ? i left ! nice taking care of ur $ $ $ $
0	decided to sit outside tonight because there was a 45 min wait for an inside table . after being seated and seeing it was pretty cold , we asked the manager to turn the heaters on . he told us that there was no way he would turn the heaters on with it being 65 degrees . too bad it was actually 55 degrees and he was a total ass in his approach to our request . i 've been coming to this place for years but seriously doubt i will be back anytime soon with how management wants to treat customers !
0	service was terrible . barely saw the waiter . waiter also stated all food was made from scratch , but when we tried to modify one of the dishes , he tells us the food was pre-made earlier in the day . ordered the chicken burrito , which was 90 % beans . the " wet " burritos were barely covered in sauce and the sauce was dried onto it .
0	but a 5 star for their food lol it 's bomb ! hire new workers asap ! ! ! and tell them to smile & listen ! ! ! !
0	unfortunately , i will not be giving this place my business because the owners are unprofessional and i was not comfortable . it 's a shame
0	i let that go & figured was a mistake . when i went again , ordered different item & same result . little to no meat . i will not be going back .
0	i 've gotten a good carl 's jr . burger before but this one was very dry . i drove home with it and it sat for 10 minutes but still was very dry for only sitting for about 10 minutes . fries weren 't the freshest . food was not worth the 10 dollars i paid for it i didn 't see the atmosphere as i went through the drive thru and i was definitely not wowed
0	the asada taco didn 't have no taste , and the pork taco was burnt . the cashier was rude .
0	it was unimaginative , unflavorful , uninteresting , i could probably go on with the " un " words for quite some time , but i think you get the idea . i had the chile relleno and it felt like i was eating an omelette with some bland chile in it . this is phoenix for crying out loud , there are much better options for mexican food . i found one the day after i ate here , it 's a bit of a hike , but well worth it . check out my review for los taquitos in phoenix for a much better option .
0	i 'm super surprised . i looked at them like ... reallyyy ? and it still was pretty much an empty bowl . usually they fill it up and i 'm quite irritated at the inconsistent service .
0	after eating there , i was horribly ill . was up all night with food poisoning . cafe rio has completely turned me off from eating mexican food of any kind . i wish az had their health grades posted in the window like they do in ca . but unfortunately , az residents have to go in blind and trust that the restaurant they are dining in is free from filth and contaminates . if you go there , good luck !
0	say for over ten minutes with no waitress our waiter coming by to see if we wanted water , drinks or chips ... we wanted to order drinks and dinner , we walked out
0	if you 're working as a cashier and don 't won 't to work then go home . worst experience ever with cashier on may 12 . @ 2 : 36 pm . her name happens to be erica . if i go to this one again will leave if she 's on the register . bad attitude , bad service won 't get my money .
0	we came at 3pm . we were really hungry and didn 't have a back up plan so were forced to walk up and down the street and settled for tacos .
0	waitress was " ok " until you told her that some of our food really sucked , then she didn 't bat an eyelash . if 3 / 4 of your party says the food sucked , then it sucks ! ! ! hey tried it , now i know . the town street is happening here awesome weekday / night life but just not here !
0	2nd i called in my order so that i wouldn 't have to wait but lucky me i got the new guy who didnt take down my order correctly . so here i am writing my review as i wait for my food . got home and my carne asada plate had corn tortillas and not flour ! that might seem minor to some but i can 't stand corn tortilla . first and last time coming here ! ! !
0	2nd , how do you forget the rice and pico de gallo . 3rd , the price for the burrito is $ 6 and you add $ 3 to get some protein . $ 9 for a lousy burrito . taste- bleh no me gusta . best burrito in town ? i don 't think so
0	2nd time at drive thru , no napkins ! i won 't be going back here again , i 'll try another el pollo loco in the area .
0	ordered simple and received food that had pieces of burnt scrapings .... didn 't even look appetizing . i expressed my concerns and the older woman says " you didn 't tell me you wanted cook differently " ? ? ? wth ? ? ? i came into the establishment to eat and in hopes my food will look like the picture but not ! took a picture and threw $ 20 worth of food . these women were just laughing at me but the joke is on you. the 1 rating is far too nice should 've been a negative 1 .
0	the service was terrible . the food was mixed up and the cashier was handling our food without gloves . unbelievable !
0	great atmosphere . ordered the most expensive margarita withe casa noble anejo and gran marnier . needless to say it was awful . the color if it alone was , a tell tale sign . it should have been very gold and it wasn 't . i ordered a grilled fish taco , but received a fried taco . it was very very small and mostly breading . also impossible to eat with your hands or a fork and knife . my bf ordered a carne asada torta . the meat was tender , but bland . the best part of everything ordered was the fries which were just ok .
0	called in my order was told 45 min . no problem 1 hr and 45 min later waiting in a not so nice part of town got my food taste like s * * t .
0	i got home , i was only given 8 pieces called to speak to a manager , phone busied out . took a drive back explained to the manager what happened , he had an attitude about it , told one of the food handlers to go ahead and get 4 more pieces and added " i don 't know whatever " to one of them . didn 't appreciate that i was being treated like i did something wrong by asking for the 4 pcs that were not given to me , not 1 apology from management or staff behind the counter . not very good customer service , definitely going to take this one up chain .
0	no thanks ! fyi- no sign posted or anything advising you of the charge until the tell you when you pay . on the contrary the signs say they gladly accept cards .
0	don 't going there . the staff closes up early and people who drove from vegas to check out the # 1 yelp restaurant . never going back .
0	they do not answer their number . 2 . they sell a " vegetarian " burrito ... but mine had a piece of beef in it . was also soggy . made me sick . not a clean or responsible business .
0	i ordered 4 del classic tacos , and the lady charges me for 4 del classic burritos . it 's funny , because before i ordered - i questioned the ditz if they still had del classic tacos , and she said yes . # 2 - after waiting 20 minutes and watching others who ordered after me getting there orders , i went up to the counter and told the ditz that i would like a refund . my number was # 31 and you just served # 36 . no excuse . worse del taco in vegas !
0	very poor service . 2 . very dirty . 3 . bathrooms are disgusting . 4 . homeless people . 5 . very slow drive thru . 6 . don 't bother unless you like to torture yourself .
0	that should really say it . 16oz , 70 % ice , $ 16 on happy hour . ridiculous . pretty sure vegas has better prices . food was mediocre , nothing really stood out . except the margarita prices . sheesh .
0	and two orders came in after me got their food first . under new management ... right ...
0	and the burger had no bacon ! ! ! ! are you kidding me ? ? ! ! ! ! somebody needs to get this place together .
0	what is going on ? this is unacceptable . get some help or something . supposed to be fast food . literally been here since 1 : 40p . it 's now 2 : 03p and i 'm late . thanks carl 's jr !
0	not only that , we watched the hostess set the menus on the floor , wipe them with a rag , then pick them up and put them in the menu stand . that was the last straw . wait staff is taking their time delivering checks and cleaning / turning tables . some training is necessary here . we 've been nothing but pleasant and cheerful , just wanted to be able to review the actual food ! we 're outta here .
0	worst mariscios in las vegas ! service was good !
0	this is not mexican food . it 's barely food . also hardly any seating since its a hole in the mall but the seating they do have is broken or dirty . the pictures of the food are misleading . they are out of half the things on their needlessly gigantic menu .
0	10 years ago , so-so . today , overpriced , bland " mexican " food , this place has gone downhill bigtime . we used to go monthly , now at most yearly .
0	? ! ? hell fuckin no ! yeah there 's no way i 'm ever going to pay that much for mexican food , who priced the menu ? ! ? ! one look at the prices and menu there was no way i could bring myself to step foot in that restaurant . bring the prices down and i 'll try the food .
0	? ! ? ! id give zero stars if i could. really ? never walking into this bar again anywhere and i fly well over a 100,000 miles a year .
0	fix your sign ... so annoyed . we really wanted mexican food too !
0	it 's 4am and i pulled up to the drive thru and they said they were closing ? ?
0	are you kidding me ? ! should have gone to filly b 's . seriously , get your shit together . your late night crew is garbage .
0	the rainbow / cheyenne store is way better . the cashier dude took forever to take the ladies order in front of me as well as mine . no hustle in the kitchen at all ! this place blows .
0	ordered beef tacos . they tried to hand me chicken at the window . gave it back after honking the horn and waving arms like a maniac . 3 people back out behind me . 20 minutes later got the order . wouldn 't have waited if i already hadn 't paid . wtf filibertos ?
0	piss poor service ! i will not be back to this place anytime soon .
0	this place is so disorganized and short staffed . not worth the time .
0	? ! oh and two drinks . i 'm so dissatisfied with this place . they hardly put any chicken on either of our meals . they put guacamole on the nachos and i asked for guacamole on my tostada and they gave me a side and charged 2 bucks for it . not impressed . won 't be back anytime soon .
0	2 $ a taco & you have to build it yourself , all they do is hand you plain tacos & you have to add your own toppings.i also ordered the loaded hotdog & the mushrooms were canned & close to frozen.sorry but won 't be coming back.tacos el gordo is way better
0	they gave me one with no sour cream and one absolutely stuffed with sour cream . how hard was that order guys ?
0	never going back i don 't expect great service at taco bell but there 's no reason to take that long . what it comes down to is this taco bell management are broken cheapskates on labor .
0	makes me wish i was in nyc where peruvian restaurants are in abundance & actually want to serve customers . ridiculous .
0	ended up leaving without receiving the food . tables where being half served .
0	the chicken tacos and burrito meat was sold out so they just used chicken fingers . the burger was just a regular burger with the same toppings as fries supreme . and it was $ 10 an item . wow .
0	? ! ? hell with you , czar of sirloin ! i 'm going to mcdonalds , carl 's jr or quiktrip from now on .
0	overpriced for a burrito bowl with very little meat . if you 're itching for some mexican food , chipotle is far better .
0	first was bad but decided to try again second mistake . drive thru order 2 big macs . got home and discovered i had chicken nuggets . went back and explained the error acted like no problem . made exchange with no appol
0	( different locations , too ) don 't go here .
0	the food is okay nothing really special and a bit over priced for the flavor . 1st time they took forever to take our order . 2nd we got it to go . get home and they had given us the wrong order ! call to tell them and of course i do not want to drive 10miles just to go back an exchange it . the manager wouldn 't even offer a discount or a freakin apology ! last time i go there . i wouldn 't recommend this location . unless you want crappy service .
0	we ordered 7 tapas which were delivered within 5-10 minutes , all together . now you must be thinking why is a fast service a bad thing .. well , because the food was cold , was sitting pre made , microwaved and sent out . i kid you not , the beef skewers were warm outside and cold inside .. same with salmon croquettes , the shrimps too . fried calamari was probably killed alive in salt cuz , thats how salty it was . cherry on top , the waiter had terrible bo !
0	wth ! ? came by at noon on a saturday and at 7pm on thursday ! poor advertising . why set out street signage with hours when they 're not open ! ? and they deliver ! ? ? yah right , no-one answers the number . what a shame since downtown could really use a good burger place , especially one that is open late .
0	portions are chinsy , they 're always out of something and no matter how busy it is or not there is always a line .
0	order wrong both times . drive thru asked for someone who speaks english to talk to me . ordered corn they gave coleslaw . i went to the door at 9 : 40pm and it 's locked . yet they close at 10pm ... makes no sense . they also didn 't have what i ordered so i said i 'll wait for them to make it and they said no . damn this place sucks . if you 're not gonna make what customers order how are u gonna make money ?
0	kid makes my food right after sweeping or something and doesn 't bother washing or putting gloves on . food went in the trash and carl 's jr will never get my business again . not surprised dateline found them / hardee 's to have an insane amount of health code violations .
0	one of them is just like the size of my thumb , and the chicken skin is not as crispy as what i have had in there other restaurants .
0	out of sour cream ( ridiculous ) . waited 15 minutes for what i thought were going to be freshly cooked fajita vegetables only to be told they were out of vegetables ! i will never go to any franchise of this chain again !
0	sent it back . 1 small fly in my second water . didn 't find one in 3rd water . staff didn 't seem to care . people after us killed a roach on the way in . if i was from here i would call the health dept . food was okay , but who knows what critters i was swallowed while eating
0	negative stars for the service . one star overall . i 've been here twice and while the food is nothing to write home about , the service has been uniformly atrocious both times . the first time , the server was just rude and refused to answer my question . the second time they toasted my burrito for so long ( basically forgot about it ) that it got burned ! plus they are very tardy with refilling their empty containers . i feel bad about giving the place such a poor rating but i think it 's deserved .
0	ate 3 bites of nachos . which did not come with salsa . cost 20.00 . it was disgusting . manager blamed it on the casino .
0	the food is good but they are terribly under staffed . service depends on the wait staff . the floor is wet and people are falling all over the place . i almost fell twice . the manager has a smart mouth . don 't check this place out !
0	and it cost 2 dollars each . the kids like the tacos but it is not worth the money . before i even pay for it i asked the cashier are they regular size tacos she told me yes then when i questioned her when i got them she says those are our normal tacos
0	i walk and not a single condolence was made for making me wait . 30 minutes each time . screw these guys , they don 't care about their job or their customers . while waiting i overheard the manager treating the workers like crap . your the manager , it 's your fault if the place has consistent problems , not everyone else 's .
0	we shared a carne asada .about 3 hrs after we ate we experienced severe gastrointestinal problems . my husband had non stop vomiting ... so much that we spent that night and into the morning at a disgusting and dirty er . we were bed ridden the next 2 days . anyone else experience this ? ! !
0	my stepdad and i both got food poisoning from garcia 's ... not pleasant .
0	if this is authentic then my mom had it all wrong but my mom knew how to make enchiladas and beans without a quart of grease . we won 't go back .
0	the mexican food here is as far from authentic as you can get , plus it is overpriced . i got the chicken tortilla soup to start off with and it was soooo bland and flavorless and loaded with tons of cheesy goop . then i got a taco and tostada and both were of lower standards than taco bell ( i would have preferred a taco bell taco ) . when i go to a mexican restaurant in arizona i expect a freshly fried taco shell , not your store bought ortega brand taco shell and i expect shredded beef , but at aunt chilada 's you get the store bought shells and ground beef ! i won 't return .
0	my wife and i had belly aches the rest of the day . never again .
0	as we were leaving food is ready don 't want it they wrapped it up and gave money back i see a homeless person on the corner i 'm sure they will like it
0	never again . it wasn 't even that busy . it was 330 !
0	30 minutes in the drive-through line at 3 o 'clock in the afternoon ? avoid this place at all costs !
0	some lady cashier was a jerk , my wife asked what was the most popular dish , this lady rolled her eyes and said , " gyro " that was it . customer service is horrible and food not nothing special , this place needs to go out of business .. don 't wait your money eating here .
0	there were only 2 cars ahead of us ! way to many taco shops in town to even give this place a 2nd chance
0	if you ever go to a tequileria that only serves jose cuervo , just get up and leave . the rest of the menu is probably awful too .
0	this is crazy . we walked a long ways along queen street and most of the restaurants are still serving brunch . you can 't order a drink and appetizer .
0	345 pm on a wednesday , 4 people behind the counter ( one on the phone ) and i stood there for 10 minutes without even being acknowledged , so i left .
0	ordering was having the counter person yell at you . like chipotle except the food sucks . the pork was sweet and gross and the steak tasteless . plain rice and bland beans , bland salsa and other toppings . worst burrito i can remember .
0	i spent $ 45 on 6 tacos and mexican fries , however there was no beef , sourcream , cheese on any of the food . just a bunch of veggies and soaked chicken thats looks like it came out of a can . great place to drink and chill but for the love of god , avoid the food .
0	the food is very overpriced for the size . the tacos are about 3 inches , think mini tacos . very disappointed .
0	worst experience in a fast food place ever . staff was rude , food was ice cold . i saw at least 7 people walk out without any food at all . cashier could not even figure out how to give someone a receipt . i like jack in the box , this location i would advise to avoid like the plague ! ! !
0	thank god u fill the food order by ur self . add another 10 to close the tab.must try to belive it ! !
0	total rip off . i get it its mill but damn ... i hope people notice other mexican restaurants . i don 't know what 's keeping this place open still ...
0	not surprised , airport food blows 99 % of the time .
0	my order was taken and then the cashier left to go scrape ice . maybe 3 minutes later someone asked if we had been taken care of . the person running the drive thru came and took the rest of the orders while the cashier was still scraping ice . our orders took 20 minutes each . horrible horrible service .
0	twice online orders weren 't ready or even started at the promised time . and when one was actually ready , the order was wrong , and , they remade it wrong ! ! avoid this location . totally incompetent and corporate could not care less . three strikes i 'm out !
0	3 orders all with beans and rice not completely cooked-- nothing like biting into hard pinto beans and rice !
0	figure this shit out bk ... it could be from that so-called " cow " meat that you use , poor work ethic / carelessness from the employees , or as a fast food conglomerate , health of the consumers is last on the priority list . people , do not eat this trash , it is disgusting and is a slow killer ...
0	service is horrible and slow . by the time they finally get to ringing me up , my food is cold . not going back . saw the cashier touching chips with no gloves on .
0	last time i went through the drive through , my order was all wrong . went today and the fries the manager / supervisor put on my try looked like they were sat under a heat lamp all day . on my way out , i asked her how long fries had to sit around before they looked like this , she said " not long . " she did offer to replace them , i declined . the point is , that 's the shift manager that served those fries , so clearly she doesn 't care . oh well , another food place off the list !
0	nope , the lines are long and the manager has nothing but excuses and attitude when confronted about why she wont open any additional registers . avoid !
0	each times i 've waited around a few minutes and nothing . get it together
0	3 waitresses all went around and never stopped by , one cleaned the table say down for 20 min and no service
0	food is bland . staff demeanor was poor . would go back only for the homemade tortillas .
0	red salsa was sweet versus spicy . the chimi was dry . it was full of meat , would of been delicious if there would of been cheese and sour cream inside with the meat or at least all over the top outside .
0	some tourists occasionally wandered into the place to get food and got theirs before me - even though i ordered a standard burrito . burrito was ( when i eventually got it ) regular old taco bell - tortilla somewhat dry and old . don 't bother . get taken in by some other crappy tourist trap on the strip ...
0	three à la cart enchiladas , one salad chips and a drink ! ! ! ! ! enchilada cheese is not even close to melted . staff is a bunch of young smart ass kids never again ! ! ! !
0	i was in a rush so didn 't found out till i got home . tried calling and no one answered at all . it 's a 24 / 7 location so people are working . even the nachos were a mess and very messy put together . i paid $ 10 and got $ 3 worth of food that i threw away . never going there again .
0	we all asked for refunds , and the employees said they were calling an exterminator and closing down for the day . we went across the parking lot to another restaurant and watched cars being served in the drive thru , and as new cars pulled up to dine in , they were not turned away . ew ! ! !
0	staff were talking to each other while we were ordering , hence , ' put corn when she asked me two seconds ago if i wanted and said no . chicken was dry and cold . the asian guy put too much rice ! over priced bowl and burrito . $ 28
0	yet another price hike for this location . it 's getting absurd ! 3oz of meat for that price is an awful value . i 'm not sure what the operators of this location are thinking , or if they are thinking . i can tell you this much- they 've priced themselves out of consideration for my family . definitely not worth the value . overpriced ! !
0	they print on receipt suggested tip of $ 12 . this place stunk like they had sewer issues behind the bar . it left such a bad taste in my mouth that i will flip the station next time i hear a sammy hagar song .
0	had to remind him about our drinks after he only brought one . then the waiter only brings out one plate of food and by the time i got mine my husband was already done with his food . and they never did bring all of my food . so pissed off , will never eat there again ! ! ! !
0	this place was virtually empty at 7 : 00 pm on a saturday night and i 'm not at all surprised . sub par service and bad food ... go next door to john cutter
0	food was cold and extremely dry . also had to move our own chairs and get silver wear for ourselves
0	got pork when i ordered beef , got guac when i asked for none , got flour torillas when i asked for corn ... something everytime . bullseye sauce is ranch and tasted sour last time i was there . fly 's flying around everywhere . really wanted to like this place but they need to figure some stuff out .
0	nothing but d-bags and ladies playing dress-up . one beer and out .
0	flat draft beer . no enchiladas , chimichangas , or typical authentic mexican dishes . extremely high priced for extremely subpar food . so , go to 7eleven , grab a six-pack ( don 't drink yet ) , and drive thru taco bell . then , take the $ 20 you saved and light it on fire . at least you 're doing something better with that $ 20 than giving it to an overhyped , pathetic attempt at serving " food . "
0	workers were very un-friendly , the food was not good and the cost for a burrito bowl was over $ 14 that 's with out a drink !
0	we ordered cocktails and it took about 20 minutes to get them . they were awful . we ordered guac and never got it . finally , an hour later we got our food . mine looked nothing like the picture . it was an egg on top of tortilla chips . we won 't be back .
0	the ambiance is nice but beyond that you won 't find anything worth ordering again . even the cadillac marguerita that was supposed to have grand marnier was totally bland . oh , and one of us got severe food poisoning . a 1 star rating is generous .
0	i 'm giving it 1 star only because of it 's great location next to the arena .... omg where do i start ? we had to flag our waiter or someone else down about 5 times ... he would disappear for 10-15 minutes at a time . the $ 13 burrito wasn 't half as good as $ 5 burritos you can get on van buren . we go out @ 5 times per week so you have to be pretty bad to have earned " my worst dining experience this year award ! " avoid this place at all cost .
0	we have a family of five and asked if they would honor happy on patio or nearby . talked to manager and she could care less . will say bartender was great and tried to accommodate us . turn away a whole family when you have an empty restaurant . can 't imagine how that 's a smart business decision .
0	the female in blue shirts with lip tattoo on her neck has a b * * * * a * * attitude ! avoid this location ! ! !
0	after waiting for 10 min while a cashiers just gabbed away at the other end , one of the nice staff members making the food stopped , removed their gloves and took my order .
0	came in for lunch during my visit to madison . ordered some steak tacos . steak has no flavor what so ever and was very bland . i will give it credit that the tacos are huge but it doesn 't matter if there isn 't any flavor . went to pay and handed the cashier my amex card . he swipes it twice and says " i don 't think my machine takes this card . " i stated that the sign on the door says you do take amex . he swipes it again and it magically worked . amex charging you a % is not my problem so don 't lie and says your machine isn 't working .
0	1 star this time for the blatant lying of the rep at the window . closed the window them to make a churro when i mentioned it , and told me it was already in the bag . well i leave , start eating at work and realize there 's no churro . please remove it if you have no intentions of following through . it 's just a churro in all honesty , but i 've asked every time . unfortunately it 's the closest 24h near me or i would yo elsewhere in a pinch .
0	don 't . have . ice . really ? ! how is that even possible ? do you know anybody who likes to drink a warm soda , let alone when you live in las vegas , otherwise known as the desert ? !
0	another hour or so and i could 've gotten them straight from mexico .
0	make sure you check your order before leaving . can 't wait for the other robertos to open up off teneya and azure . it 's further for me but the quality of this location has gone down hill lately . other robertos i 've eaten at are much better .
0	to go items wasn 't made togo orders weren 't made . and the rolled tacos had toothpicks rolled up in them . not poking through the side . very hazardous .
0	don 't come here unless you have an hour and a half to kill .
0	1 . waiting 20 mins in the drive thru . 2 . got my order without free biscuit burrito , but because they took so long , i didn 't have time to actually turn back . 3 . my am crunch wrap was cold and the cheese wasn 't melted like it used to . very disappointed
0	manager gave us chips and salsa and said it wouldn 't be too much longer . as the cook was eating , i said enough . embarrassing ! asked for my check . it took another 5 minutes and then manager didn 't come back . charged me $ 55 for our margaritas . manager disappeared . pitiful ! don 't know how a restaurant operates like that ! !
0	that comes down to 1.25 for a 1 inch by 1 inch piece of chicken ( photo is in the photo section ) . i was really hoping to like this place since it 's so close and i don 't have to drive to 67th ave. and happy valley for ammos since i am right around the corner from this place . food was bland and when i asked why the chicken was so expensive , she said it 's because it is marinated .
0	and it wasn 't good ! i was on the search for good mexican fast food and this place is not it .
0	oh , and music was blaring super loud . my earbuds turned way up we 're no match for it . i think this is my last visit .
0	only customers and we get cold food , carne asada burrito greasy cold , champurrado cold , asked for money back ... no money back manager / owner wants to reheat the food ! ! !
0	train your fucking employees . look at their salads on their website , then look at what they just gave me : lettuce , dressing and a half cup of chicken only a floppy as tortilla . not even a tortilla bowl . a loose tortilla , for $ 10 ? ! get the fuck out .
0	employee cracked raw shell eggs then put on new gloves without washing hands . rice , green salsa and soup stored in refrigerator wrapped with saran wrap . items discarded . green salsa left out at improper temperature . salsa placed back into refrigerator . chicken , beans and salsas in reach-in refrigerator at improper temperature . items moved to upright refrigerator . first-aid kit stored on wall above clean equipment and raw onions . kit moved . food stored and reheated in to-go bags .
0	? ! ? ! i am not going to go into details but 5 of us were here today for lunch and this was one of the worst places in arizona that i have ever been for mexican food . the food quality is poor , the " summer menu " was limited in choices , the street tacos were nothing to write home about . the white " cheese " on the nachos tasted like paste . i was thrown back when the bill arrived and after a 20 % tip , we blew $ 80.00 here and there was no way this place was worth an $ 80.00 lunch . do not go here for the food ! ! ! ! ! !
0	$ 10 for tacos that are not up to par with taco bell . last time for me .
0	i understand your minimum wage ass is miserable and broke as fuck but don 't take that out on customers . now i know why i see videos of fast food employees getting their ass beat all the time . don 't go here , unless you like being talked down to by people who make 8.25 an hour .
0	las vegas , nv 89121 taco bell sucks so bad . just went through their drive thru and it took 25 minutes . after being annoyed with the delay i decided to take their survey . and i can 't . my receipt doesn 't include the survey code , it says it 's a reprint . probably given out like that to avvoid getting bad surveys due to taking forever on their drive thru time . this taco bell is so awful !
0	all the drinks are pre-made and come from plastic containers that look like anti-freeze . you have no idea what type of liquor you 're getting or how strong the alcohol really is . the service was horrible and we had to ask for our check several times . the food was good but the overall alcohol and atmosphere was poor . probably would never go back and would definitely never recommend to anyone
0	i counted . need i say more . well yell thinks so so again 68 minutes
0	worst 3 days of my life , and ruined the trip to vegas . beware !
0	the service was slow and terrible , we had to ask for all of our drink refills , food took 45 minutes to get ( was not hot ) , and we were still forced a 18 % tip . there are a lot of great restaurants in the downtown madison area , this is not one of them .
0	plus , the guy behind the counter licks his finger every time he picks up a paper which goes over the plate . and nobody wears gloves . actually chicken made me kind of sick to my stomach after 20 minutes . i will go back to saba 's . seems like most reviews are coming from the people they never had a real persian food . not a pleasant experience . thanks to tums .
0	wtf ? worthless . i refused to order anything else . we drove here specifically because we love chipotle , but have never been to this location . never again !
0	nasty hostess with painted-on eyebrows tells me they can 't seat us because they only have three servers . sooo apparently their servers can 't serve two tables each ? no wonder this place is always empty ! ! ! they turn customers away from their 75 % empty restaurant on a friday night !
0	this time , no napkins , sweet n low , straw , mustard or mayo packets . i 'm done . you will not see me again . i 'll get rid of the app , i 'm done . insane ... insane .. fast fast fast means , we do our job or directions you 've given us . i deserve my money back after this order . they are lucky i am having a diabetic reaction or i 'd have them take the food back . this was the worst ever ... ever .. it 's just stupid .
0	no seasoning whatsoever when they cooked it . if you want bacon in your burrito , it 's $ 1.00 extra . cheese ? that 'll be $ .50 . way too expensive for food with no flavor . the waitress didn 't even ask if everything was ok , so she must know it 's awful . won 't be back here .
0	has become even worse . if you want to appreciate every other cafe rio , come to this one . it 's awful . always out of what you want . workers who all look overworked and under appreciated . no manager in sight . it 's not worth the 20 minute wait .
0	typical rantoul . i heard the staff joking around on the speaker while it took 3 times to take my order .
0	15 enough .... you have 5 ppl in line now who know what they want at this time .... still haven 't been acknowledge by any staff .... it 's not rocket science ... 4 employees standing around and not a single person can start a fucking order .... never ever again .
0	my friend got an entire burrito with guac and cheese on top and it was only $ 6 . total ripoff and the customer service was awful . do not recommend this place . rip off .
0	lots of uncooked green peppers , very little chicken , one sliver of onion and whole thing tasteless ! side plate had one teaspoon of guac mixed in with lettuce , no cheese and no pico . waiter didn 't speak english so communication was a problem and request were ignored ! this place is off the list .
0	7pm on a friday , packed must be good , looks are deceiving , ordered 3 tacos , when i got them home i opened the container , and walla , i observed 3 sorry small tacos , with a little more than a teaspoon full of crumbled i would assume steak , i bit of white substance , it was either cheese or cabbage , there was not enough of it to distinguish the difference.had a homerun inn frozen pizza for dinner , next time ill make my own tacos .
0	chips and salsa more $ $ $ ? at least when i saw how big the burrito was i thought it might be ok . then as i start eating it i realize it 's literally 50 % rice . only about 4 ounces of meat . what a rip off . if it was at least good i might of thought it was acceptable . it wasn 't . no flavor at all . taco bell would be 1 / 4 the price and much better . this place is way over priced and not good at all . stay away .
0	8 : 00 in the morning and cleaning the grill stopping all food for an hour an this place is open 24 hours there always slow and really don 't seem to like having folks order an make them work
0	smaller portion sizes , higher prices . service is not as good as it used to be either . i have stopped eating here .
0	walked in . owner was yelling at the top of his voice at an employee telling him he was not family but a helper . owner then came over to me and said hello with a smile . comical . oh . did i say 87 health code score . disgusting ! !
0	and by any work , he was taking orders , making them , wrapping them , and working the register . 10 minutes of standing there while all of the other employees goofed around was enough and we left . not the chipotle i 'm used to . i 'll stick to the other ones from now on .
0	no beans and rice but it was full of frozen veggies . weird . and then to make it even stranger they slathered it with cheese and some funky sauce making it more like an enchilada . i left wondering if anyone working here even knew what a nopal is ?
0	lmao ! ! ! what a joke . oh well technically they have tenders available . pfffft . can they shut this location down and give us an el pollo loco please ?
0	7 : 55 - waiters and what looks to be like a manager or owner have an argument by our table ... waiter walks by and apologizes . 8 : 00 - no water no waiter 8 : 05 - no water no waiter 8 : 06 - we walk out would have liked to try what looks to be delicious and creative dishes ... hopefully they get their act together on the service !
0	this is not a burger joint , most people do not eat this type of food or have never had it before . customer service was horrible , food was minimal for the price and they rush you through even when you 're the only one in line so they can get back to whatever else they 're doing that 's more important . voiced my opinion to corporate , who apparently doesn 't care enough to even respond . not the best business model when you 're new in town . i 'll walk down to palmyra or the banzo food cart before going here again . you 've been warned .
0	i 've never been disappointed in their food , but today was bad . tacos had dry chicken and no cheese ( ordered extra cheese ) , chips were soft , stale , and undercooked , queso was lukewarm , and enchiladas were congealed in cheese ( i got there just as they were bagging the food , so it didn 't sit there ) . asked for whipped cream and strawberries on tres leches , and they were out . there 's a vons in that center , why not go get some ? can 't believe i paid for this .
0	for a mcdouble ! i asked staff why it took so long and the cashier said , " oh , we had big orders . " really ? a couple of " big orders " throws off a mcdonald systems franchisee ... for 22 minutes ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! for a mcdouble ! ? ? ? ! ! ! !
0	when she gave me my food it was almost dropped bc she couldn 't take the time to make sure i had a hold of it . then when i asked for ketchup i was ignored and the window was slammed shut so i waited , holding up the line and drive thru times . oh well . i wpuld have rated higher bit customer service is top of the list . i 've worked for mcdonalds and one of the first things they teach u is to treat the customer with respect and smiles . i got no smiles , just additude and ignored .
0	steak was old and a little crunchy ? employees need to smile more and actually act like they want / need their jobs . a girl without a name tag was rolling burritos , cleaning the dining room , and stocking supplies with what appeared to be the same gloves she was wearing to roll burritos . gross ! we will not be back . save yourself the frustration and eat elsewhere .
0	rude staff . bathroom was disgusting and only one stall had a working lock on it . the food has zero flavor with the added bonus of indigestion . if you are ever forced to go , stick to beer and save your appetite for filberto 's later .
0	nothing with it it . no beans no rice no sour no tomatoes . service was awful but the food was worse . i 'm from out of town and all the other restaurants had an hour wait . this place had seats available .. should of been my first clue . we told the server it was my daughters birthday and he forgot . he didn 't come back to check if the food was ok . if i were you i would find another place to eat .
0	i have been to this location five straight times and they never get the order right . if you wanted regular nuggets , they give you spicy nuggets. if you wanted no lettuce , you get lettuce . double check your order before pulling off . employees tend to not give the best customer service .
0	the customer service is always crap . usually laughing in the background when taking drive thru orders . just all around bad .
0	a bad experience ; a waitress tried to rip us off , just i know i am not coming back again
0	please don 't eat at restaurants that serve rabbit meat . empanadas and enchiladas are fine with any other meat ! rabbits are household pets and should be spared from restaurant menus .
0	our first and last time going there . i wish i would have read the reviews first . we bought a groupon for four which was $ 89 . then after the automatic gratuity ( 20 % ) , we paid an additional $ 71 . so , we ending up spending $ 160 ! the sangria was not good at all ! the salmon tappas was salty and the rest of the food was ok .
0	i truly don 't understand the appeal . the food is good , but other than that ... would definitely not recommend .
0	not very clean either . table was not even wiped off . burrito made me feel sick after eating half of it . you have been warned . taco bell is so much better by comparison .
0	then the memories that i have sealed return , saying hey , what about the terrible one on val vista and guadelupe roads ? it 's the same local chain , surely all your previous visits were aberrations , and it will rebound to approach the quality at the other locations . no . chips and bean dip are consistently room temperature or cooler , service is generally inattentive . enchiladas tasted microwaved . water glasses and plates were dirty . albondigas watery . 30 minutes to get check . i just don 't understand how this location is so much worse than the rest . hope betrayed too many times , just pack it up at this location . shut it down !
0	don 't know why i tried it , but i ordered the chicken mole , and literally choked on the seasoning in every bite . it 's just not made with love , or any decent recipe . my husband ordered shrimp tacos , and the shrimp was deep fried . i didn 't see that coming !
0	the drive through attendant was barely audible and seemingly as high as a giraffes belly button . the food was cold , like never melted the cheese cold . just shredded cheese and cold diced tomatoes on a suspiciously luke warm tortilla . the worst . i 'll never go to any del taco , first and last time there .
0	staff are all mindless nimrods ! ! ! ! ! ! this dump should be closed ! !
0	it only got a star because i couldn 't put zero stars ! this is a disgrace of a place to get mexican food ! service was terrible and they can 't split a check ? its not that hard to do so honestly considering everything is in a system ! never coming back here ever ! absolutely horrid !
0	the worst $ 10 i 've ever spent at a restaurant . they should rename this place " el vegetal loco " seeing as how the burritos and tacos are 80 % vegetables ( mostly raw onion ) . my chicken burrito was basically a bean and cheese burrito with just a small bit of sour cream on one end . what miniscule chicken that was in the burrito was bland , tasteless , not an ounce of seasoning ! you couldn 't pay me to eat here again .
0	this place was a total let down . the food lacked flavor and seemed like it had all been canned or frozen . nothing seemed fresh . the service was slow and the employees appeared as though they had 10 years left of indentured servitude .
0	guaranteed a 45 minute no matter what time of day . always a line to the door . if you know this is going to happen regularly why not increase staffing ? ? drive the extra distance to legacy or coventry or pittsburgh need be . stay away from here
0	this food makes supermarket el paso stuff taste like fine dining . how can you even call the crap you serve a taco ? disgusting , cold , sloppy , flavourless mess . even tortilla didnt taste like tortilla . avoid at all costs .
0	went here ordered my kids a kids quesadilla and a bean and cheese for the others , not price checking , that was a huge mistake . chesse quesadilla- 12 dollars. lol for a local and theres absolute amazing mexican places rt around the corner from this hole i was totally livid.no sides are even included . bean and cheese burrito small and crappy looking ? 12 dollars . this place is obviously never getting my or my friends business again . dont friggin go here . even if you are staying , its just a joke .
0	i wouldn 't eat here again on a bet . the food tasted like if someone set a homeless guy 's trash cart on fire and served the ashes . i 'd rather suck the ass-end of a menstrual skunk than eat there again .
0	the chicken they serve seem to be half servings . mac n cheese is always cold along with the mashed potatoes . if they happen to serve hot it 's over heated n over cooked . the service is terrible . when u ask for something additional they sigh and act like you 're such an inconvenience . wish there was a better one close to my work .
0	crap service . normally i can overlook sub par service , especially if the food is worth it . this is an exception for me . actually walked out before our drinks even arrived ( first for me ! ) server was beyond rude and even my kids said it seemed like our existence in the restaurant was a real problem for him .
0	to top it off , the waiter was a smart ass when , after 15 minutes of his being mia , we inquired as to his whereabouts when we wished to order more drinks & food . on the plus side , the food was fine and arrived quickly ( even before the chips and salsa appetizer ? ) .
0	even the staff knew it giving me 2 stamps on my card on the way out
0	do not come here the service is bad and the food is disgusting . i had to stop by because a friend of mine suggested this after a night of drinking . i am making the effort to write this review in hopes that this place shuts down .
0	if i could give no stars i would . i went for lunch , and waited almost a half hour for some tacos and a salad . while we were waiting , there was two other tables that ordered after us and had gotten their food before us . when i went to ask how much longer it was going to be , both of the waitresses snapped at me to wait my turn like everyone else , and they would bring it out when it was ready . i would not recommend wasting your time or money .
0	i just waited for 17 minutes in the damn drive thru . once you 're in it there isn 't anyway out of it either . unacceptable . absolutely unacceptable . the very least that should have been done was a 20 % discount for such a ridiculous wait for a burrito . never again ! such poor customer service !
0	i noticed insect feces on our serving tray . later i checked their health inspections online . looks like the county has had corrected them for cockroaches and other sanitation issues they haven 't resolved . ick . a kid took our order . when it was done no one called us or brought it to us . when i checked on it the kid had no clue . i saw our order sitting behind the counter and pointed it out to him . then he gave it to us . the man cooking ignored us . lots of taco stands are run by folks who care . these guys don 't . i predict they will be out of business by september .
0	i ordered a burrito , and when it arrived , there was practically nothing in it . i complained and asked to speak to a manager . that individual was very nice , agreed my burrito was not right and replaced it . hopeful of a filling meal , i tucked in to a now full beef burrito . my first bite was a mouthful of inedible gristle and sloppy beans . as was much of the remainder . total and utter nastiness throughout . not recommended . at all !
0	not clean . disorganized . place was half empty yet we waited 55 minutes for two hamburgers that never arrived .. we were starving so ordered chumus while waiting . it tasted like it came straight out of a can . eventually i left some money on the table fit the chumus and walked out , never having gotten the food we ordered . embarrassing . i 'll never return or recommend to anyone . if it were possible , i 'd give less than one star .
0	the food is very average at best . no flavor . the waiters don 't bother to serve water often . very overpriced . it is extremely overpriced . $ 45 for sangria pitcher ? $ 22 birthday fee ? ? are you serious ? don 't go here .
0	their waiters and waitresses are a disaster . be careful , especially if you have a food allergy . they don 't know their menu well enough to help you- nor does their manager or their gm . go to any other restaurant before this one . you will see a comment from their gm below but do not be deceived . they already talked with me and did nothing about this . avoid this restaurant .
0	we spent $ 65 on a meal and drinks here and quite simply wished we hadn 't . the best thing was the guacamole they make at your table . the bartender was a pretencious and less than desireable human to be around . not much else to say ... skip ! ! !
0	absolutely dirty didn 't even get to order so gross and unprofessional unorganized environment its a shame the appearance ran me out of there
0	the guacamole was brown and the salsa was bad . customer service was terrible , reporting this place , the kitchen was filthy . i do not recommend this location , it 's a possibility you could get sick .
0	not only did i pay for two tacos and only receive one , but there was a dirty to go sauce container where my other taco should have been . how does that even happen ? will never be going back .
0	service was awful . will never come back here . we had to serve ourselves our own chips and salsa and they still billed us full charge . they got my order wrong and the food server had the audacity to tell me it was my chimichanga when it clearly was a burrito . food was gross . the bartender apologized that they were short staffed .
0	would not recommend . the staff is super rude and act like you are inconveniencing them when you eat there . place is too small . there are plenty more similar places around go there . don 't waste your time here ...
0	i had enchiladas and a taco , just to give them a chance . this was the worst mexican food i 've ever had . waaaaaay too much government tasting cheese on the food , and hardly any meat . i do have really high standards because i grew up on tex-mex but this was just pathetic ......
0	my fish tacos were greasy & the " sauce " must have gone bad last week . and honestly it sucks walking into a place & the staff acts like they don 't want u there . will never eat this over priced crap again . yuck .
0	specifically ordered two " basic " margaritas , they charged us for the " ultimate " margarita which is $ 16 a piece , btw . either way it was undrinkable after one sip . the queso was like an old soup and the salsa was the only thing edible- probably because it was store bought . a good $ 44 for having a couple bites of salsa basically . horrible service , horrible experience .
0	terribly service . store stinks and had to wait forever . i was waiting for 7 minutes before anyone even came upfront . then keep waiting for food . i have even gone through their drive through multiple times and it takes forever !
0	waited in line for 20 minutes ... i was only the second car in line . i get to the window and the guy who takes the money , had a cigarette tucked behind his ear ! ! in plain sight ! never in a million years . they need a management change ! i can only imagine that his hand were not washed ! slower service i can deal with ... things happen . but this disgusting scene ... never again !
0	wouldn 't waste even $ 2 on their chips and salsa . rude staff ! ! ! ! !
0	absolutely hands-down one of the worst mexican meals i 've had in my entire life the pork was so salty you could hardly eat it " i did not eat it " there was some burnt black crusty things in it .. the chicken was a four out of 10 the salsa tasted like it was out of a jar with a little added cilantro , the chips obviously came from a bag ( cold ) .. first and last visit !
0	to be clear , i have been to many guu locations . we waited an hr for a dish , while watching people beside us get theirs after coming in 30 min later . let me correct myself , the food tasted like crap too . save yourself sometime and find a better izakaya .
0	i 'm not even joking . i didn 't know there could be worst mexican than taco bell ... today i was proven wrong . bland . basic . bleh . i wish i could rate it lower than 1 star
0	health code violations everywhere . a full dirty bus tub sitting there directly by the door to walk in . all the tables were left dirty . they were out of everything we wanted to try . tamales . all desserts . horchatas . everyone was so incredibly rude . i was insulted . i regret giving them my money . we will never return . i will tell my friends not to come . this is the worst service i have ever received at any restaurant .
0	absolutely horrible. am i allowed to give this -15 stars ? terrible service , terrible food , terrible wait time. all in all a terrible place. don 't go here !
0	i could write an essay on it but i don 't want to waste any more time on this place . avoid .
0	bad hospital cafeteria food is the best thing i and the other 5 people with me could say about it . do not waste your time or money
0	close this place down already or get new management ! ! ! horrible customer service very dirty ive been here 3 times and every time they have got my order wrong ! ? something should be done with all the complaints they have received
0	don 't bother coming here . we came because its and taco bell and a pizza hut so everyone could get something they liked . we waited 20 minutes just for the tacos and 35 minutes for 3 pan pizzas . the staff was unapologetic and every single one of them gave us attitudes . the assistant manager did apologize to us but she should probably get rid of the whole staff there especially the young black girl who had the absolute worst attitude out of all of them . don 't go here . there 's plenty of other places to go around here .
0	don 't waste your time here . service is horrible .. waited over 30 minutes for food .
0	i waited 25 minutes for 2 tacos that ended up being ice cold . when it read that other reviews had the exact same experience as myself , then that certifies that this taco bell is a perpetual pos and this will reoccur . do not bother coming . never coming to this garbage place ever again . do not come here or you 'll regret it
0	weak drinks , over salted everything , rubbery meat , slow service . if you are in desperate need of an alcoholic drink , then buy it here . but , go to burger king next door if you 're hungry .
0	i ordered the zucchini and corn salad - 20 mins later i was told that there is no zucchini . so i ordered the spinach and avocado salad with candied pecans . there is 2 tiny slices of avocado and loads of spinach with pecans . they really skimped on the avocado . the 2 main dishes we ordered were the polo con mole and another chicken dish with poblano peppers . the quality of chicken was atrocius ... it was extremely dry - as if they used it from a frozen packet . completely disgusting . i would never go back there again .
0	food was less than mediocre , poor service , overall worst dining experience i 've ever had in vegas . you 're much better off in the food court . stay away .
0	i am a regular uber eats user and i was sad to see that our favorite mexican restaurant garcia was no longer available . we decided to give this place a try and could not have been more disappointed . horrible bland nasty food a complete waste of money no one in my family ate their meals i would never recommend this place or reorder from them .
0	i 'm used to the brazilian type places such as fogo de chao , so my expectations were high ! ! the mediocre waiter did his best , but all of the meat was over cooked .... even the pineapple was over cooked ! ! ! the " mandatory " drinks were watered down , and the $ 1 per person water tasted like the ocean non filtered ! ! the shrimp was dry , and the cheese bread cold and hard ! ! will never visit again ! ! !
0	i ordered online clearly stating what i wanted on my food and it was entirely wrong . i ended up with a pita with meat and over a handful of banana peppers , something literally no one could eat . i called and they told me i couldn 't be refunded or get anything because i went through post mates but if i want to drive there they 'll give me a new one when i just paid to get it delivered ? horrible service . never again .
0	food is mediocre to begin with and bad management makes this a place to never visit .
0	absolutely horrible .. messed up my order and food was soggy and disgusting .. never again .
0	my husband just came back from this kfc , it 's 9 : 45pm ( they close at 10 ) on a sunday night . when he pulled up to the drive-thru he was told he couldn 't order because " they didn 't have anything anymore " really ? ? they were obviously just lazy kids who didn 't want to make anything else for the night . won 't be back .
0	the chef is a pure a * hole food is over priced and the place is full of dust . must have been good in its hey day but will never return food is dry and overlooked garlic shrimps are tiny and flavourless , and the chef acts like he 's some big shot . save your money , go somewhere else paella for two is 50 and even though the portion size is reasonable i felt like i was eating day old food . not worth my time or money .
0	absolutely horrible .... rude waitress , glasses were dirty , and the food was very plain .
0	a group of friends and i came to dine in and no one came to speak to us for 15 minutes. the girls that work here are unprofessional & very rude. would never recommend coming here to anyone
0	dont go there if you dont want to wait for 15 minutes or more at any time of the day . went through the drive through and with only 2 cars in the drive through and still had to wait for 20-minutes ! ! -then my food was so burnt and hard that it makes you wonder why you waited to begin with !
0	service , intelligence level , and food . save yourself a headache and for somewhere else .
0	i suspect this is a management issue as this is not the type of service i 've experienced at other locations . do not eat at this location !
0	they always get my order wrong and the employees are rude . i recommend not visiting this location get some pollo loco from down the street .
0	we went inside to place an order and waited 46 minutes from when we ordered until we got our food . and only got it because we went up to counter and asked where our food was . then they handed it to us on a tray when we ordered it to go ! ! never again .
0	so understaffed its bad , as i 'm ordering food , the cashier also works drive thru so she makes the driver outside wait till i finish ordering so i felt hurried and they still got my whole order wrong . smh and as they 're bringing us the food , they say nothing to you and drop it and leave . first time trying carl 's jr. and never again will try it cause the poor service there. i 'd give a negative review if i could . smh .
0	the bad experience started with a rude hostess followed up with an inpolite waitress who did not know the menu and topped off with a horrible meal . within ten minutes of leaving i was vomiting and i was sick for another 6-8 hours after that . i would have to say this was in my top five of horrible eating experiences . taco bell would have been an upgrade to my experience here . i will never return and would not recommend it to anyone unless they were my enemy nah not even them ! : ( : ( : ( : ( : ( thats 5 frownies !
0	so slow this could not ever be considered fast food and no manager in sight to let know about these issues , trash overflowing
0	the only thing that was yummy were the chips and salsa . they smother melted cheese on top of almost all your plate to hide the old and tasteless good on your plate . our carne asada tasted like it had been defrosted in the microwave right after we ordered it . more like jerky than steak . and then the beef tacos were chewy and also had a funny frozen meat taste . we are still on a mission to find delicious tacos here in phoenix . frustrating considering we are only a few hours from mexico . oh well . this place definitely isn 't it .
0	the restaurant is way too small- the bartenders were extremely rude and i really had high hopes for this place ! the food is mediocre and the tacos are extremely small yet pricey . i will not be returning unfortunately
0	i hit one star on accident and don 't know how to delete it . there are not enough words in the english dictionary to describe how bad this place is . the best part about this place is i didn 't get sick . stay away . you 're better off eating out of the dumpster behind taco bell . and healthier for it .
0	the security guard was the only professional in the place .
0	not sure how this place has been here so long . the restaurant has a haunted type of unclean feel . the food is absolutely awful . i 'm not sure how the health department hasn 't closed this place down yet
0	" there spicy salsa had no flavor and was unbearably spicy and i like spicy . now a couple of hours later my stomach is turning and i 'm going to have too miss class tonight . mexican food that is not even close to mexican food . thanks wandering donkey !
0	service was very slow , guacamole was thimble sized , food tasted flat . the only restaurant worse was mr. chows !
0	absolutely overpriced and unexceptional , have limited bar that is expensive , spent over 70 bucks for me and my wife to have two tacos , 2 beers and two forced open you mixed drinks ( it is not a full bar , if you want a mixed drink you have to get one of their concoctions ) will never come again
0	carnitas has three reservation times 5,7,9 . why can 't i reserve 9 : 30 ? i understand if i said 5 : 30 it would through off their timing for tables . i even suggested leaving a deposit .
0	i left starving . this place was outrageously priced . i 've raged all day long clubbing and pooling it up ; i wanted a meal . we had to leave this place and go eat again . i 've never had such small plates . then they serve you flat water with no ice and i couldn 't get refills to save my life .
0	i ordered 3 burritos and 1 taco , didn 't receive my taco i paid for , all tortillas were stale . fries extremely salty and old . ordered a mtn dew and got diet coke . wouldnt rate this a 1 star . shut this shitty ass place down . teach your employees how to actually work . doesnt deserve my business nor do he employees deserve $ 10 an hour .
0	my waitress lost my credit card while trying to charge me for my meal . she took it away with my bill and didn 't return it . i understand that things happen but what 's most frustrating is that no one cares there . i have left the owner numerous messages with no return call . the girl i spoke to on the phone said " i just work here " and that the owner was in strawberry until monday and won 't call me back . this is ridiculous ! ! you lost my card ! ! you should care that you lost my card ! ! !
0	10 people in line and we waited 30 mins . these employees have no idea what they are doing and it was the most frustrating experience ever .
0	the person taking the order was rude and unprofessional .
0	food took awhile but was hot . guy taking my order seemed dead inside .
0	absolutely ridiculous wait for absolutely mediocre food i have no idea why anybody would wait in line as long as he do for this place with so many other great food choices in the local area i suggest staying away from here
0	something in my burrito tasted off and asked if i could try something else and explained how there was much more hot sauce than i expected cooked into the burrito . the girl at the front ( leidy ) looked at me and told me she " didn 't know what to tell me " and that i should " look at the menu more carefully and know what i 'm ordering next " and that i would have to pay for something else .. horrible customer service ! ! you should never have attitude with your customers . that was my first and last time ever eating there . leidy clearly doesn 't value the experience that her managers customers receive .
0	nor up to par with competitors . burrito was very small , little toppings , and minute made rice . the side chips were very bland and no flavour . the salsa was watered down , and then drink was too small . overall a complete waste of $ 11 . i do not recommend this place .
0	i went through drive-thru and ordered my food and all was well . i pulled up to the window and waited for at least 20 minutes for someone to come out . time passed and no one even came by to at least make me pay . out of frustration i drove off . worst service ever and according to other reviews it may be the worst mcdonald 's location .
0	roaches in the bathroom and all over the salsa bar . the store smelled terrible the moment i walked in . i 'll never eat here again .
0	second they were out of chicken breast and said it 'll be 20 minutes before it 's ready , how does el pollo loco not have chicken breast ready ? ? ? third once we get to the window the drive thru worker didn 't say a word to me , she acted as if i was inconveniencing her . i had to ask for my receipt ! fourth i finally get home and realize my order is wrong ! i don 't understand how you can completely mess up every aspect of the customers experience at your restaurant . i know it 's only a fast food restaurant but service standards still need to be met .
0	an hour and a half before closing , the woman manager told us that they were out of chicken and got all defensive when we asked if they can make more ... an hour and a half before . she began giving a lot of attitude for no reason so we went to chipotle instead . thanks for nothing cafe rio , we will never be going back because of your very poor customer service from that manager .
0	the manager basically called my sister a liar when we were trying to make a complaint on an order . completely disrespectful .
0	tried to go thru the drive thru at 6 : 30am on 10 / 21 / 2017 . lady was very unprofessional .
0	will never return . food is mediocre and the fact that service outweighs the beautiful views and atmosphere means we will never come back .
0	tacky . food was bland . drinks were beyond expensive . only upside , i suppose , is that the place is very clean . which is surprising considering the attention they put into everything else ( non-existent ) .
0	the ordering process was extremely disorganized . by the time i got through the line and paid , my tacos were cold . the employees behind the counter can 't even hear you because it 's way too loud . the food is sub-par , don 't waste your time or money .
0	the staff was unfriendly , the whole experience was awkward and the food was terrible . both mine and my friend 's .... there was one girl there at lunch time.all the food was cold and was not fresh at all . plus it was way too expensive for what you got . can 't say terrible enough ! i feel nausea coming on just thinking about it . sorry pachuca ... i know business is tough and bad reviews suck but you need to step it up big time . the place is pretty inside and could be awesome .
0	we had a rehearsal dinner here with 25 people and i am beyond disappointed with the food and the service . tacky paper menus , drinks ordered that we never received , they didn 't clear our table of dirty plates before dinner and before desert , plates just pilled up and when i asked if they could be cleared i got attitude from our 1 waitress . food was nothing special . you can tell they weren 't interested nor did they care about us . you think with such a big party knowing we were spending more money they would care a little more . i can say for sure we will never be back .
0	burritos are way more expensive than at any other other place with way less flavour and way less topping options , and guac is $ 2.21 extra wtf ? ? that is an absurd amount to charge for a small dollop of crappy guac . i have been to two different chipotles in toronto and have been extremely disappointed in both , i will never be returning .
0	margaritas are tasteless and impotent. salsa and bean dip completely horrible. beef burrito pictured for you to see is missing the beef and much more : an absolute joke. chile relleno breading is mushy and insides still cool from having being nuked. the worst experience imaginable - only reason for this nightmare joint being open is captive audience of local workers. do yourself a big favor and avoid at all costs - it does not get much worse than this : virtually inedible fare at high prices and incompetent management .
0	purchased a restaurant.com in 2013 for 112.50 which does not expire and clearly states on the certificate that it does not expire . went to make reservations , and i told the person that i would be using the certificate , he placed me on hold 3 different times only to tell me that the general manager said he would not be accepting the certificate . that 's too bad , we were going to have a rehearsal dinner there , but not anymore !
0	i tried calling in an order and was basically yelled at for not ordering the way this guy thought i should order . the food will keep this place in business for a while but eventually these fools will run all of the business off . beware of this place and it 's horrible service ..
0	i have already been in the drive thru line for 15 minutes with only 5 cars ahead of me . this will be my one and only visit here . i will be late for work because i am trapped and can 't get out .
0	i will never return back to this location they just lost a very loyal customer ! !
0	no sour cream , no salsa , and no guacamole . then it was tossed in the oven so even the lettuce was hot . this is also the first time i got store bought chips at a " mexican " restaurant .
0	it said grilled . chicken was shredded and i 'm pretty certain canned or something . tortilla was warned , otherwise crappy chicken lettuce and cheese for $ 11 . i could not eat the whole thing even though i was hungry and i am not a picky eater . mcdonald 's would have been better
0	got my order completely wrong and had to drive back . the cook looked at me like i killed his puppy when the cashier went to talk to him about it . then not one apology for the inconvenience ! the food isnt good enough to go back and deal with that to me ! so long robertos !
0	service was terrible . we were left at our table with no drinks or anything for over 20 minutes , while 2 tables that were seated after us were taken care of . we tried to be patient and understanding , but when we finally received our food it was cold and tasteless . i wish it was possible to give negative stars .
0	my family goes out to eat 3 or 4 times a week , and love chipotle like i said , but we probably won 't be going back to this one .
0	it 's st patrick 's day and the music was so loud and horrible and then to top it off ... so was the food ! i 've been coming here for years for cocktails and wings , but i can honestly say , i will never be back ! we ordered the nachos and they served it with just chips and beef ... no cheese , no salsa , no tomatoes ... nothing ! i 'm not one to usually complain but billy and eddie , it was pathetic ! taco bell serves better food !
0	i could buy microwave or taco bell that is better . staff has no management direction . pitiful . do not know how these people are in business . i honestly tried to think of a worse experience and could not come up with one ! ! ! awful , pitiful , untrained and unprofessional staff ! ! ! !
0	i would compare it to a quality of dogfood . i wish i could get my money back but i am too timid to create a scene in public . will never go here again . this is not mexican food by any means .....
0	employees do not care about customers at all . gave this place another chance today during dinner only to be told it was at least a 30 minute wait for chicken . are you kidding me ? no chicken , at dinner , at a chicken place ? and not remotely crowded ! if the employees could get off their phones and butts and earn their minimum pay ... since that will never happen do yourself a favor - avoid this place at all costs !
0	the guacamole was mashed avocado with zero flavor . the chicken tacos were dry and chewy . we did not enjoy the salsa at all . the ceviche had the most overcooked rubbery shrimp smothered in a foul sweet tomato sauce that i got nauseated from . i actually had to spit out the shrimp . the margarita was very sweet but okay . we ended up going to a second meal at crab and mermaid .
0	took 20 minutes to even order with 2 people in restaurant . the two workers couldn 't move any slower and could care less . chicken was hard as a rock and not fresh at all . very poor quality food . the location could be so great right next to the movie theater but with this bad food it has no chance . food was expensive . family of 4 with one entree each $ 50 . don 't go ! !
0	i would honestly say that taco bell is more authentic and a better quality . the burrito was $ 13.00 and was the size of what you would traditionally see in a kids menu . rushed service and dirty tables .
0	absolutely the worst mexican food place in cleveland , there are too many other good places to eat in cleveland to bother with this place
0	meat was pre-cooked and reheated in the microwave . owner lied when asked about the microwave . do not ever eat at this restaurant .
0	absolutely the worst mexican i have had i can make better food in my damn toilet chips were stale and the arnoldpalmer was spicy
0	really nothing positive to say here . the food is bland , stale , and obviously reheated . avoid it .
0	the place did not look sanitary and the food was not worth its price - it was too expensive for something that tasted worse than what i can cook up myself . chicken was dry and the green sauce thing had zero flavor . i will never go back and i do not recommend going there in the first place .
0	3 bartenders and couldn 't be bothered to make eye contact or barely take an order .
0	i check my fries and they were old and cold . i drove back around drive up and handed them to cashier , who handed them off to a young man who tossed them back in the oil and sent them back out to me . i 'm sure you got a great laugh . your store owner lost a customer . you trash received my entire order .
0	under staffed . they had one man behind the counter for all three taco lines . very unorganized . i had ton stand in line twice . it took 30 mins to have my order to go . a pastor burrito and two pastor tacos . i will definitely think twice about recommending and or dining there again . the holiday hours are open until 7pm and the staff seemed ready to go at 6 : 20pm when i walked in . they should have much better customer service considering there are so many more choices in the surrounding area .
0	we waited for a half hour before grabbing a waitress .
0	order was made wrong and then when i asked for it to be redone they removed the wrong items and brought same sandwich back . took it up to the counter and asked if they gave me the same sandwich . they proceeded to lie even though i could still see the previous ingredients on it . when i asked them a second time they tried to get out of it at which point i just cut my losses and asked for my money back . neither worker seemed to care that their mistake could have made me sick . i wouldn 't patronize an establishment where the workers have no integrity to keep them from lying about the food they serve you .
0	taco bell is higher quality . we were drawn in by the crowd , but turns out they were in there because of the cold : ( sorry to be harsh ...
0	no management , or they don 't care . extremely slow , wrong orders , overcharging , no ice , flat soda , dirty tables , you name it , i have experienced it here , and i 've only been 4 times .
0	cranky service and prison quality food . avoid . some airport places are good this one should be better and it 's just gross .
0	went thru the drive thru was going to place my order and was cut off . while they cut me off from placing my order 2 cars that drove up were already ordered and i was still waiting never going back
0	meat was rough i didn 't eat but one bite asked for meal to be replaced or taken off . manager said no but he will box up the order for me .
0	meat was rough i didn 't eat but one bite asked for meal to be replaced or taken off . manager said no but he will box up the order for me . he said i 'm only one customer out of thousands he would loose .
0	we had a large group but that was no excuse for the poor customer service . took over 15 minutes to get drinks . had to get our own chips and salsa . food orders were wrong . drink orders were wrong . completely forgot someone 's order . avoid at all costs . much better options to choose from in the neighborhood . wouldn 't be surprised if it was closed soon . wish i could give it zero stars .
0	do not come here . if you ever come around this area do not come here because all you will receive is abuse . the owners are terrible people , not to mention they are just arrogant and think their terrible food is the best around ? i think not . stop by taco bell for better food and service .
0	absolute trash , she gets the order wrong and then denies that she did , she blamed us for it and denied to give us the right order until the cook said yes , absolute trashy service .
0	i threw the last half away and wish i had done the same with the first half . no flavor , dry , tasted stale , and on and on . if there is no other place open still don 't eat here .
0	employees have horrible attitudes and the food was disgusting . i asked for steak and she said you have to pick something else we don 't have any . what do you mean you don 't have any ? ! we were there at 3 : 00p you don 't have any or you just can 't keep up with what you need ? horrible ! ! will not recommend it go to ever again !
0	not sure how / why they trained their employees to be scared of giving someone more than half a scoop of everything . portions are terrible , rude employees all around . my burrito bowl didn 't even fill the " bowl " more than halfway absolutely disgusting to pay $ 9 for nothing . don 't like this location and the people there .
0	it 's like mexican food for people who don 't like mexican food . much of the food had little taste to it . i would rather eat taco bell , and i don 't like taco bell .
0	had to get our own napkins after waiting 20 minutes while on outside patio , only one other table with customers outside . rice was burnt and food was horrible . even our children noticed the difference . been going to the cave creek location for over 20 years . i 'll never come back here again .
0	tremendously long wait . three cars took over 15 minutes in drive through . each car waited 5minutes to order . i thought they were ordering a bunch of burgers but when it was my turn to wait it also took 5 minutes . poor people stuck behind me . there goes their entire lunch break . no quick burger run here . drive a little bit further and get done quicker .
0	way over priced even for airport food . staff was not very friendly and where just kind of hanging out .. seating is tight and does not allow for any dinning enjoyment .. had chicken quesadilli and chicken was hard and rubbery probably from being over cooked .. choices are limited in this terminal , so if you have time maybe explore others .. better yet , stop at subway and grab a sandwich for your bag ..
0	while pricing is spot on , you 're better off with a stop to taco bell . our entrees were greasy , flavorless ground beef piles . i had hoped that adding salsa would save it , but alas that was tasteless as well . save yourself the trip and possibly a night of indigestion .
0	none of them seem to care about anything . zero enthusiasm and zero attention . such a shame to have a franchise that usually does it right elsewhere to being so lackluster in my town
0	i believe the manager or owner 's son works there and he is terrible . lazy , slow and a really nasty attitude . throw in the fact that they changed my time form $ 5 to $ 50 makes me never want to return to this restaurant . thankfully amex stood up for me and i got my money back .
0	accidently dropped one of my ( empty ) cups on the floor after ordering so i asked if i could please get a new one the lady told me that they would have to charge me because once the cups are given to customers its the customers responsibility .
0	i arrived at 9 : 55pm today and after taking my order , the girl refused to complete the order by saying they were closed . it was a 30 minutes drive for me and i 'm never going back . i 'll be contacting corporate in regards to this unbelievable unprofessional costumer service .
0	this is the third time in a month . we left and went to the competing store . message to the manager , this is a great way to lose business . corporate will be looking at your store real soon . may the force be with you .
0	a taco place should have some of its culture there but it didn 't .. the food was as bland as the employees . much better suited place is mucho macho taco which blows this place out of the water . if you eat here only get a potato taco , and try the ghost pepper hot sauce .
0	my husband purchased 1 dozen green corn tamales and a half dozen green chicken tamales for christmas eve . so here it is christmas eve and we just unpacked the order to discover we only have 11 green corn tamales -- no chicken tamales at all . very very very bad ! he said they were very disorganized when he was there , bad service . i will only go to the cave creek location from now on . merry freaking christmas !
0	the location is great , the establishment is cool ... but the food ... really ... sadly disappointed . expected so much more .... i mean ... so much more . will never go back !
0	i have had better mexican food at faustos . the waiter was awful . guacamole for $ 16 . you 're kidding . the food came out within 10 minutes of ordering . the beans were dry , like out of a can . the chips were most definitely out of a bag . the chicken tacos were tasteless . the rice was a gooey buttery mess . seems to me this restaurant survives on hype and tourists . it was completely overpriced , and not worth it , whatsoever .
0	we happened upon this place when strolling downtown . i was intrigued by the decor but after that it goes down hill . even the salsa and chips were lacking . very peppery , chips are frito like and no mexican flavors at all . i hoped the meal would be better but the chimichanga i ordered was bathed in what tasted more like aurora sauce and the meat was swimming in oil with a tomato sauce . my daughter had the enchiladas and they were smothered in a very poor excuse for mole sauce , even worse than from a jar . it was a waste of money and we left hungry but our plates were full !
0	sadly to say we were both disappointed ! most expensive lunch i 've paid for and received hardly anything . paid $ 8 for a small flour tortilla size chicken quesadilla , which barely had a tablespoon of tiny chicken chunks . i will not ever go back nor do i recommend eating here ! !
0	i 've been craving this place since then . today i went back to pick up two green chili burros to go and was completely disappointed with the quality of meat this time around . just about every third bite was met with a mouthful of fat ! by the time that all the fat was picked out of both burros i was left with potatoes and chili . i don 't plan on ever returning to this spot for anymore burros . on a side note , if you plan on paying with anything other than cash there is an additional .75 ¢ fee added .....
0	stopped into to grab something to eat after a long day of travel . bartender closing down his register , kitchen was getting cleaned up , waitresses were closing out and and doing side work . when i asked if the restaurant is still open the rude bartender pointed at the gate across from me and said when that plane leaves they close . i walked out of there , who wants to eat at a place that is 99 percent closed down and on top of that they weren 't even inviting and said hey we 're closing down but don 't worry about it , come on in and grab something we will take care of you . stay open till you close .
0	i 've gone to the location on decatur which is really good . i made a order for pick up they got my order wrong . which i understand can happen but when we went back my bf order a burrito it was half open and looked like they half ass 's my food point is . if your mad you got the order wrong don 't just half ass a service you have to fix !
0	explains the service and attitude . food and ambience were exceptional but they really need to screen their employees better
0	went last night . they are closed down and there is no notice on their website , had to get refund for our coupon .
0	they just put on there . avoids giving you a receipt and you have to go out of your way to ask for one to make sure you 're charged accurately . i have been here before but this is my last due to the same issue . treat all customers fair and equal . always offer a receipt so customers don 't feel ripped off .
0	chips and salsa : chips were burned and gross chicken fajitas : six pieces of tiny chicken and a sizzling plate of under cooked vegetables ordered kids chicken soft taco : she brought beef pointed out to server taco was beef not chicken : smiled at me clearly not understanding a word server returns with replacement taco : beef again ( this actually happens twice before we he
0	don 't be silly , neither mexican or healhy .
0	all the meats were not offered , server precalculated tip , salid bar was very limited and most importantly we all felt sick several hours later . many better options available even at the 1 / 2 off price .
0	wrong orders served left and right , cranky , back talking workers with absolutely no customer service skills . i ordered one thing and the cashier kept calling it another , i kept correcting her and she replied , " it doesn 't matter they cost the same . " i can 't imagine how inventory turns out monthly . take your time while in the airport and find another place to eat .
0	that is no homade pasta . too expensive , for the food they served . in about 40 ' ...
0	unfortunately , this place is terrible . i have been through the drive thru twice . both times the wait was about 15 minutes . in drive though minutes , that 's like , forever + 1 . this is with zero to maybe one car ahead of me . the second time i went i was overcharged . they did correct it , but how do you change someone for 2 things when they only order one thing ? ? ? do yourself a favor and go to the one down the street near buffalo .
0	the owner was called and their story changed to having to be 19 + and ordering a beer to have the special ; this is not advertised on any signs . this place either falsely advertises or hand picks who gets the ayce special without hassle depending on how they feel that night .
0	drove out of my way . closed up lights off . you suck feel taco
0	the fact they have 5 people on the line and can 't keep up with the traffic is a shame . while i 'm ranting , the fact that one person is still allowed to order four burritos at a time proves that no one follows social norms and guidelines . drive to legacy
0	chips and salsa not complimentary . salsa is not hot or good . they dont serve pinto beans . ive tried this place twice . the last time was with my fiance , neither one of us was happy with the food . the best thing about this place is the outdoor patio and atmosphere . i was born and raised in new mexico . i will never go back to this place .
0	she ignored my shout and my request to close the lid tight for the customers . on top of that she did not put the food that i ordered in the bag , so one of us did not get to eat breakfast . make sure you check your bag before leaving this # @ $ $ & ^ ! ! ! ! horrible service ! ! !
0	a few minutes ago i went for the drive thru service and a lousy worker could not explain a question about my order and put what he felt like in my order i was so angry i left .
0	the price you pay for the amount food is not good . also 2 of my co-works went there and ended up sick . they had the same food . also one of the guys his salsa was placed in a dirty container , it had qaucamole in it ...
0	ordered a burrito which was dry and not much flavor . the salsa was way to hot . my friend didn 't like what she ordered either . the food was way overpriced for what we got . we both wished we had gone to taco bell instead !
0	spent the night in the e.r. , with ecoli / food poisoning and kidney pain ( just like the boston students ) . i tried to call the location and the manager was no help , i tied asking if anyone else was sick and just give the heads up . the manager was 100 % out of the loop , had no idea of what to tell me . never eating chipolte again ! ! !
0	a food catering truck has better food than this restaurant ... service is good but the food is gross ... wouldnt recommend
0	i am giving this place one star because i have no choice , but also for the super sweet and helpful cashier . where do i begin ... the drive-thru didn 't work so that defeated the purpose of convenience . our order was incorrect and our food was cold . the portions for the cost is not appropriate either . overpriced and under delivered ! since its a new place , i can only hope it improves .
0	the pulled pork was white , which was disconcerting as i 'm used to seeing it sauced . it wasn 't particularly tasty and both of us felt ill for days afterward . so , not recommended . yeah .
0	thank goodness for the coupon as i would never pay $ 25 for four tacos and a couple drinks . the tacos were just so so , nothing special . the queso for the chips was nacho cheese . if you are thinking of going here id highly consider salsaritas heck even taco bell over this place . if i had to name a positive i guess id say the soda was good and cold ? what a failure this place is .
0	while the sign said open that day at 11 : 30 they weren 't . so i suggested we go today for lunch ... and i see they aren 't open until 5 . it 's summer lunch patio weather people ! i give up on the lunches .
0	it tasted so bad i thought it was a prank . god , it was awfully . do we really need another fast food mexican restaurant in this world ?
0	" this place is foul . see the picture added above . it is so disappointing to know that when arizona takes 2 steps forward an establishment like this brings it 5 steps back . disgraceful .
0	as for the food , the presentation was good . unfortunately , it goes downhill from there , due to the stale potatoes and bland chorizo and eggs . the food and service in its restaurant doesn 't match the hotel .
0	small disgusting overpriced dishes . don 't waste your time and money here . basura de comida .
0	the quality of service and food is not what it used to be . staff turnover is high . management does not seem to care . so sad but i am not going back any more .
0	i ordered the 3 ground beef tacos and i really must say i was having a hard time remembering if i 've ever eaten a more bland and flavorless taco in my life . in my mind i was trying to compare it to taco bell ( the standard for bad tacos ) and barburrito might even be worse in taste , though larger in size . i don 't think there will ever be any compelling reason for me to ever want to have it again , this wouldn 't even pass for hangover food .
0	i am still looking for my gift card 3 months later . i tried to email the manager with no response what a shitty establishment !
0	we were pointed to gardunos by some locals who claimed that this spot had excellent reviews . bottom line the food was awful . we ordered the fajitas and some flautas . the beef in the fajitas tasted pre made and the tortillas were dry and hard . the flautas tasted like the kind you would be in the market and just shove in the microwave . truth be told i would have rather had taco bell . i assumed that vegas would have excellent mexican because of its geography but i then again las vegas is a tourist town with a lot of hit or miss restaurants . if you decided to ignore this review just please keep some pepcid on hand if you eat here .
0	i showed up on the wrong " party " night . it was extremely loud and chaotic . i attempted to order a drink at the bar while i wait for her , and with no luck . we decided to go next door to another space . perhaps you might want to try the space on a slower afternoon ?
0	the last few times whether it was drive through or eat in , the food has been cold and poorly and sloppily prepared . when i talk about poorly prepared i 'm talking about the inconsistency in how they prepare their combo beef taco plates ( sometimes they 're filled with toppings and meat and sometimes they 're not ) and how their refried beans look like they 've been sitting in the kitchen for longer then it should be . as far as their salsa bar , some times the the salsa is watered down and sometimes it 's not . while the food is decently priced and i want to support local businesses , this place is a disappointment .
0	the barrio cafe appeared to be the only restaurant that i could eat at and still see my gate . needless to say , i was starving and everything sounded good . i had ordered the arizona burrito . it was ... well ... bland and distasteful ... the meat had large chucks of hard inedible fat in it and lacked flavor . even for airport food the barrio cafe is terrible . service was mediocre the waitress was indifferent and preoccupied talking to her co-workers . i will never go here again . even if this was the only place to eat i would rather go hungry until i land at my destination then eat at the barrio ....
0	i ordered a vegetarian burrito and it was the worst burrito i 've ever had . it was extremely bland and filled with plain rice . some of the rice was under-cooked and was still crunchy . there was a tiny bit of cheese and a lot of burrito sauce which just tasted like mayonnaise . as for vegetables there was only 2 skinny slices of roasted red pepper and a small amount of corn and black beans . not much for a vegetarian burrito . there 's nothing gourmet about this place !
0	the food is horrible and overpriced for what you get . my family and i recently went last weekend and i ordered the cheese enchiladas and found they were made with cheese sauce instead of real cheese - very bland tasting . my wife ordered the seafood enchiladas which consisted of grilled shrimp which were overcooked and dry . for $ 80 for three people , we expected much more .
0	from rice and beans to burrito or tacos the food was bland or over spiced that you could not tolerate the taste . skip if you have a choice .
0	huge mistake . it started with them not being able to find my order because they had my name wrong & it went downhill from there . when i got home i found my soup was not in the bag . i opened the box for my entree & the pictures listed was what i found . never again . very expensive & the food is terrible .
0	the people at this place were so rude ! ! ! i waited in like for like 20 minutes as they were working at snail speed to be told they don 't sale lunch at 9am . there is no signage saying you cant order lunch and the ingredients are there ! i told them i couldn 't eat eggs and they were no help ! lesson learned . i will never step foot at this place again and next time i 'll make sure to get something before this hell hole ! !
0	they don 't even give you a side of chips for what your paying . poor service and poor food , i would give this place a negative rating if i could . should have complained to management but too hungry to wait in that long line again . never eating here again .
0	he suffered second degree burns and ended up in the arizona burn center because of his injury . the manager / owner of the restaurant called us back , but did not apologize . his response was that i should " teach my kid to not touch hot lights . " ok , well you should learn customer service and building maintenance you jerk ! here 's the entire story on my blog http : / / wp.me / peqk4-gc . if they are so callous about service and maintenance , imagine how they are handling your food ! my advice is to stay away from uncle sam 's at all costs ! ! ! ! ! !
0	my food was cold . i had to get my own chili sauce since the waiters were doing nothing , cause it wasn 't even that busy . took forever to just get my sprite in the first place too . won 't return . horrible service and cold meat .
0	since that time we have not been back and will not return .
0	i ordered the flautas and my fiance ordered the carne asada . by the time we got our order , the food was cold . the unappetizing meat inside my dish was rubbery and the potatoes in the carne asada were hard . needless to say , it was not worth the money we spent . will definitely not be going back .
0	their guacamole was great , but the rest of the food was lackluster and missed the target .
0	overpriced and terrible quality food . i 'm sorry , but $ 5.25 for a cheese enchilada is ridiculous , when other nearby restaurants do a better job for less . the red chili burro i got was flavorless , and the pint of salsa ( also overpriced ) was lousy . i am a phoenix native , and i won 't go back . the chain has gotten careless and greedy .
0	for the over priced and bland food it was was beyond not worth it , considering they gave , my mom , my 3 year old and myself ( 9 months pregnant ) food poisoning . we stopped in yesterday on fourth of july , and today the 5th have all been in bed with non stop vomiting , and fevers ! i had pork nachos , my mom had beef tacos and my son had a basic cheese quesadilla ! it was a 40 dollar meal with drinks , and it was the worst 40 dollars we have ever spent ! do not eat here !
0	the girl originally said it would be ready in 10 min , then 7 min later they came out and said that it would be another 30 min ! ! it 's 6 on a friday ! ! ! ! ! ! how do you not have things prepared ! it 's not looking good for the chipoltes in the this area . we are now driving to the one on bell rd. hopefully everything goes smoothly there ....
0	the tres leche cake is basically dry pound cake because they don 't put enough milk in it anymore , much less whipped cream . the 1.99 side of guacamole was one teaspoon in size . the chicken used for the buritto was less than half what they used to use . it 's been steadily declining for the past year . we 're done going to this location .
0	when your manager is rude after messing up every stage from ordering to putting together the right order to delivery to trying to resolve what went wrong , that 's a business that 's no longer a part of its community . for years , i was the most loyal papa del 's customer . we 're never dealing with papa del 's again .
0	our waiter , orlando , was obnoxious . while delivering our food , he sang " la cucaracha , " served us day-old bread , and held up our payment by 20 minutes . disappointing and disgusting .
0	there 's a lot to say , so i 'll keep it to bullet points : - for this price $ 38 , the steaks were tough , under seasoned , and overdone . - service was horrible . water was warm , server was inattentive , sour cream was liquid . - the worst part , saw multiple busboys wipe down tables , then wipe plates with the same towel . wouldn 't recommend this place to anyone . do yourself a favor and keep walking .
0	the bad service made me question my value in life and for a brief moment i felt as if i was an utterly useless piece of shit . tomorrow i will wake up to the sun and feel no warmth . p.s. don 't order the quesadilla . its a taco with a piece of chip on top . i can take a shit and put a chip on top and call it a burrito and it would be the top order on the menu
0	after speaking with the nurse it is most likely food poisoning . no other bugs are going around . my friend who also ate there did not get sick , but i had the carnitas taco and he had the beef . perhaps someone just forgot to wash their hands . anyway , not going back .
0	serious sick food - its not so much the food as the people serving americans they hate us enough to put a little something to make us violently sick . i know this food made me sick this is my opinion . take your chance it will only cost about $ 10,000 dollars in accumulated bills , all because you wanted to save a few bucks and ate food at a germ infested resturant .
0	yesterday i stopped by and got the chicken fajitas . about an hour later i started getting very sick and long story short ended up in banners er with food poisoning . my roommate ate my last little bit of leftovers and started showing symptoms ( major diarrhea ) this morning .
0	they are rude and don 't care they are not worth getting sick over period
0	my food was terrible . and , how the fu @ k do you run out of forks when nobody is in your establishment ? won 't ever be eating here again . save yourself the disappointment and go to any of the other nearby restaurants . f this place . f them right in the ear .
0	it did not stop there i felt like i was going to throw up my stomach ! sounds nasty but then i had bad diarrhea .. i could not hold anything down .. i felt like shit all day it was horrible ! i will never eat here again .
0	we gave it three different tries . we are done . i fail to understand the appeal of this restaurant or how they stay in business . the food is decent , but don 't be hungry or have any place to be as you 'll be waiting . and waiting . that 's after you 've waited and waited for one of the empty tables . then there is the completely incompetent , rude and totally unprofessional staff to round out your miserable dinner .
0	that negative attitude was unnecessary . some restaurants ask you to bus your own tables and others do not . it was a legitimate question that could 've been answered with a nicer attitude . would 've left 5 stars if i didn 't receive such poor customer service .
0	just glad i didn 't get sick ! ! !
0	thank goodness there 's a mcdonalds on the way home .
0	the margaritas are like juice and not at all worth the price . bartender was rude and clearly not liking his job . i tried to give them a little slack since it was taco tuesday , but there are way better places out there without the long wait and much better drinks and service .
0	it was a huge disappointment . her refried beans were burnt , the rice was dry and her dish was a bit on teh sorry side . plus , the waitress didn 't bring her water ( it wasn 't a super busy day either ) . the waitress also was prepping some food between handing money and serving customers without washing her hands . very unimpressive . i hate that this place was so inconsistent .
0	i called back and someone else made excuses for him . gold clipper and market magazine coupons . the guy that was making excuses was worse than the old guy . i was a regular , not after this . i 'll pay a couple dollars more and go to fiesta
0	sadly to say after 3 different meals and visits to their drive thru i have to report the food is beyond edible or palatable . on two occasions the beans and rice were disgusting . i attempted the chicken quesadillas were sandwiched between two massive tortillas with queso slop not cheese , the chicken tasted like canned chicken that had not been opened in years . instead of putting sour cream and guacamole on the side it slopped on inside which added to a even sloppy mess . the flavors were so bad that this expensive mess had to be just thrown out . with all the options there are for mexican food .... runnnnn to somewhere else . serrano 's was heaven compared to this place .
0	) before we tried them . while waiting for our order we were served chips and salsa and were very disappointed . it was obvious they don 't roast their ingredients and it just tasted like tomato . my wife asked for a spicier salsa or something more authentic and they brought another but still disappointing . the tamales and accompanying sides were also very bland and not very good . this place reminds me of a cafeteria and the food is definitely not authentic . don 't waste your time or money , we will not be going back .
0	food was average but price was good . if a hair wasn 't found i would have given it 3 stars .
0	this is probably the worst taco bell i 've been too . service extremely slow for three tacos . 15 minutes and i 'm still waiting . very disappointed in the customer service . if you have a manager on duty and they can 't run the place any better than this maybe you need to change management . just saying . i probably won 't revisit this location again .
0	i 'm disappointed to say that i was quite disappointed . i had the chicken quesadilla which was just cheese and chicken , very plain , no sauce . it looked and tasted like something i could have made myself . half of the quesadilla was just bread and i feel like i paid 14 $ + tx + tip for a tortilla bread . also , the waiter spoke 0 english . i don 't need him to be super fluent but he did not even understand basic menu ordering . a bit awkward as we had guests from out of town . i wouldn 't go back and i would not recommend .
0	although i wish that we could review the food , after 15 minutes at the bar we were only given water and no menus . the bartender was clearly under the weather and said so much . not our problem . good luck if you venture in for a sunday lunch .
0	julio 's too on camelback is still going if you need to get your fix of julios food . lots of memories of eating at garcias and julios at this location , sad to see it shuttered .
0	this is absolutely the worst del taco i 've ever been to . food is crap , drive through took 20 min . absolutely ridiculous ! don 't do it !
0	have enjoyed the food up until this past saturday when my son and i both got food poisoning after eating the chicken burrito and enchiladas . we were sick all day sunday and when i called the restaurant monday to report it to the manager , the girl on the phone said there wasn 't a manager to speak with , so i told her and all she said was " okay , thank you . " no i 'm sorry , nothing . i will not be going back ever . very disappointed .
0	after my delicious first wrap , i went in here again and got the alota fajita with beef. it was disgusting. i had two bites and spit the second one out. the beef was gritty and seasoned weird. the green peppers and onions were stringy and not nicely textured. my salsa was watery and it had one huge tomato chunk it. the chips were stale. wtf , mate ?
0	i watched a guy in the kitchen put cheese dip in a bowl and take his bare finger to wipe the cheese off the edge of the bowl , then he put his finger in his mouth . then , with the same hand , pick up some peppers and garnishe the cheese . i got my food , and just like the previous time , it was cold . i sent it back and it was even colder the next time . it 's very unfortunate because it 's a great atmosphere . i will say that the manager and server both times were very nice .
0	they scrimped on the meat the first time and also on the second time . they don 't put meat on their meat tacos ( ok , they put a tiny bit ) and they didn 't honor a coupon i had given the waitress before ordering . the owner refused since the second dish wasn 't officially an entre , but cost as much as one . what a cheapskate ! don 't bother with this place unless you like $ 3 lettuce tacos . there are so many foodcarts and restaurants with great value downtown . however , the hot sauce is great here . but you can get that in other places too , can 't you ?
0	bad decision on my part . this restaurant is a far cry from the los olivos i know . terrible margaritas , food was bland , loud restaurant . i was embarrassed to bring my family here . go to the original .
0	yuk . don 't let your friends eat here !
0	" what the hell ? haha who does that and wants a good tip ? i guess not this guy ... because i " forgot how to tip " properly . enjoy that $ 1.50 and find another job , dude ! i tip bartenders better than that for one drink his loss , amc 's gain because i had to buy food from them instead . sandbar loss money- not just their terrible server !
0	we are only 1 mile away right off puritas where they are located . poor service . we will no longer be eating here .
0	after an hour of swatting fruit flies for entertainment our server let us know that there was a " miscommunication " and we 'd get our food shortly . mind you we were the only table inside . two 2-tops outside . once we finally get our food , the quesadillas didn 't even have the pork in them but by this time we had waited long enough so i just inhaled them and tried to get out of there as soon as possible . would not recommend nor return .
0	the menu needs to be a little bit more specific on exactly what is in each item and what the choices are for each item .
0	i get to the window and ask for only red sauce no green and of course they give us 2 green and 2 red to go with the four items ordered . we park and go to the window to ask for more red sauce and the man gave only 2 more red . i 'm not sure about you but i need more than one sauce for a burrito ! ! poor service .
0	i went there last night to get those free meals , and a very rude manager named andres told me i was not on their list , and he had nothing for me . what a poorly-run restaurant .
0	well this isn 't the place to go because at 12 : 30 on a saturday the week forte was reviewed and recommended in seven magazine , they were closed . no sign , no notice just a waitress behind locked doors trying her best to ignore us . so we went to a chain restaurant , one that we knew would honor their hours . boo on you forte boo on you .
0	the main salsa was okay but nothing to write home about . i ordered grilled chicken nachos and they were brought to the table and looked like something a 5 year old would have made and i felt the presentation of them was bad . my family members ordered the fish tacos and yikes .. not good at all ! ! ! i ordered the chicken & shrimp fajitas and they were nothing special . i have been to many mexican restaurants in vegas here and i don 't recommend this to anyone .
0	however it is completely closed . just a heads up to anyone else looking for kosher food in vegas .
0	okay , possibly the service could be entitled to a three star stamp . i had the mole and chicken enchilada . the poultry was desiccated and the corn tortilla was eloquently not house made nor fresh . my partner 's dish came out of the microwave . i will go back to make a clearer assessment because the disparity margin is quite large between my review and everybody else 's .
0	i decided to give it a try . after waiting in a long line to order and hustling to find a place to eat my food . i must say i was extremely disappointed . the carne asada : meat was chewy and the tortillas were cold . fries were straight from the freezer to the fryer and given to me cold and soggy with oil . it is possible that this place was good at one point but it 's mediocre at the best now . the popularity of this place has cause it 's quality to suffer .
0	service subpar and food is bland . i am mexican american and know good mexican food .. this is not it ... surprisingly they are still open with a great mexican style food arribas right next store ... buyer beware steer clear of this establishment .. i 'm a stoner pig and could not even choke down my meal ..
0	the bussers were more attentive than the server , asked her several times for a side of chili never received anything . the worst i have had here in phoenix .
0	so after going out of my way to find this place and driving all the way to the other side of town i found out that it 's in a very sketchy area ( right across the henderson detention center ) . after walking in you can barely breathe due to the horrible smell of sewer coming from the back . secondly you receive what would be the worst possible customer service ever , and to top it off they serve you food that is cold to the touch . i definitely would advise to stay far away from this place , and i certainly will not be going back !
0	my hubby and i have come here at least 5 times since living close by here and every single time we come we come thru the drive-thru and they never have anything ready . we have to wait for 5 to 10 min for the food . sometimes the food doesn 't even taste fresh and they are always missing something in our order . i don 't know how hard it is for the employees to work there or what they 're doing in there to mess up orders and not have fresh food ready but this location needs to get it together . my husband and i said we weren 't coming back to this location again .
0	their portions are huge but the customer service was really awful , the cashier was extremely rude . the food was good , but with such bad customer service i will not go back .
0	there was a " possession " notice on the door and it was locked . hopefully they reopen soon . it makes me sad to see local businesses close .
0	as i walked into the restaurant , i was surprised by how rude the staff was . there was no greeting or assistance . the food ( # 13 and a fish ceviche tostada ) tasted bland . the icing on the cake was when my fiancé felt something crawling on his arm . he looked down and saw that a roach had crawled from his arm onto the window . he quietly notified staff to tend to the matter . a server came out with a fly swatter to kill it , but left it lying somewhere in the booth behind us . we both woke up this morning sick from food poisoning . avoid this dirty restaurant .
0	it was a monumental disappointment ! i took my wife on saturday and we were waiting at the hostess stand for almost 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged us . then , after being seated , my wife asked for a salad that had pomegranate and they said they were out of pomegranates . we tried to
0	wrong idea. there was a change of ownership and the food was not so good. most of the stuffs were dried and the salsa was horrible. what a big mistake . 4dollar for a corona. are you kidding me. never again. yuck .
0	to say the least we were very unimpressed ! the service was horrible and the was just edible ! i had the burrito deluxe and it had almost no flavor . the wife had a chicken dish cooked in sour cream and she said that it was very bland . after our food came to the table the server never returned to refill our drinks and i had go find him to get our check . the only saving grace about this place is the salsa and chips . the salsa was very spicy and fresh . we would not recommend this place to anyone and will not return !
0	now the margaritas are margarita mix with little to no tequila . the salsa taste like tomato paste . we had to find a server and use a take out menu because no one seated us . then we used a coupon and our meal cost more than normal . don 't bother going there 's better service and food all around .
0	i only ordered 2 meals , one with no sour cream or pico . of course both are on my tostada . oh , and the cashier forgot my drinks . he wondered why i was still waiting at the window after another 5 minutes . i will never return to this location .
0	i called to place my order for pick up . i ordered the daily special but was told by the manager i would have to eat it in the restaurant ! when i asked her why she told me she didn 't know and i should call corporate . i called corporate and got an answering machine . the manager refused to put it in a to go box unless i pay regular price . regular price is $ 5.00 more . this is poor business and makes no sense ! i will never try to give them my business again !
0	when they arrived at our table , the tacos were incomprehensibly small , heavily over-salted , extremely dried out , and simply unsatisfying . the other person who i went with ordered the carne asada quesadilla and shared the same sentiment . bottom line : if you want to overpay for sub-par , pseudo mexican food and only get a fraction of a serving , visit this taco shop . if not , find another place that will give you higher quality for your dollar .
0	food over priced for thr amount you get and its nothing impressive . the service was slow . looong waiting time i would def not recommend if your looking to eat a real meal .
0	the nachos were topped with cold meat after waiting quite a while to get them , one in our group said that this was just a tick above taco bell . i 've had better at taco bell for sure . one also talked about the fact of choices in the airport & how this place probably doesn 't give a rats ass about yelp reviews because they are set . i 've had a lot of good airport food in this country , it should be an absolute privilege to have a spot in a place with limited choices & numerous clientele . c 'mon vegas , you 're better than this ! how do you screw up nachos ! ?
0	i finally walked-out with my 6 yr old daughter as the help simply looked-on ! 1 server working 12 tables by herself during prime lunchtime . this has been a common occurrence at this location ... horrible management . if you are lucky enough to get service , it is extremely slow ( especially for cocktails ) . we are finished spending money at this particular location . what a shame . we have been customers of chilis for many years .
0	after seeing a worker actually flossing her teeth in the kitchen ............................. no thanks , not a place i 'll go back to - shame after the praise it got on triple d
0	food was awful ! it came out cold . it took over 15 min just to get water . had to go to the bar and ask for a refill . my margarita that i ordered before my food , came over 40 min later ... after i had completely finished my food . it 's not like they had a ton of people there , it was 1 / 2 empty . there was nothing good about this place . repulsive ! ! ! i don 't see how they are even in business .
0	there is always some kind of problem with our order . burned chicken was the most frequent . burned to the point of a chemical taste . today , no white rice . how does chipotle run out of their staple item ? poor training and response time i guess . just disappointing that an otherwise good place is such a disaster . if you can help it , drive to a different one !
0	i 'm sure it 's a staffing problem . get it together taco bell ! !
0	the girl that left her conversation in the back was the drive through person , and had to write the order down and ring it up in the back . after ringing it up , she cleared it off the screen to keep drive through times low , then had to keep asking for the receipt to make the food . the burgers were correct , but both cups of chili were only half full . still sitting in the restaurant , listening to the loud eude conversations of the workers ..
0	when we turned to the door to leave , the male hostess decided then to seat us but at that point it was too late and we were already aggravted . customer service was horrible .
0	that 's it . sadly for us , we were informed that after standing in security line for an extended time , we could not be served alcohol because none of the employees on duty was old enough to serve ! ridiculous ! the young girl behind the counter kindly directed us to the only other bar in terminal 2 , which was much farther from our gate and already packed ( we had already checked ) . it 's absolutely frustrating that of two bars within the entire terminal , one of them can 't find an employee over the age of 21 ! on the upside , while we didn 't try the food , it did look and smell delicious !
0	just wanted to buy some over-priced water ( $ 5 ) .
0	it bothers me that you move down to the location that you 're at and then you change the entire flavor of what made the place what it is today . maybe you 'll read this and understand that the guys standing at the register does have something to do with the customers coming in ! ! ! ! !
0	omg ! ! ! its like storage no restaurant . ill never go again !
0	they are charging $ 5 for a bottle of inca kola ! ! that 's called abuse , basically $ 5 for sugar and water . i just wish there were more ecuadorean restaurants in the city .
0	never went back . bad service - waitress was snoddy .
0	i ordered the plato which included one meat i chose chicken , rice , refined beans ( disgusting ) and a side salad . everything was just pure wrong except for my pinapple drink . i do not recommend this place to no one , unless you want to have some disgusting mexican food than you are more than welcome .
0	first of all , the workers were acting sketchy right off the bat .. after buying my meal , i get half way through when i bite into a nice big piece of hair ! so i call the location about 3-4 times , no voicemail available or anything , probably shaving someone 's head for the next person who orders some food .. i will never go to this place again
0	as we approached the front door a friend said he thought it looked closed , but it turned out it was open there just weren 't any people inside . the place smelled like a sewage plant on the inside , and we immediately turned around and went elsewhere for food . luckily my friend said a new ramiros opened near his house , because i will definitely never go back to this location again .
0	after trying to blueberry hill the day before and been dissapointed we decided to just do anything quick the next time so we headed to taco bell just before leaving vegas so we stopped here just off the strip and needed something just to give us some fuel for the drive back , and well theyre cheap like any other taco bell on the food , chicken burrito was ok it actually surprised me .
0	food was mediocre and service as well. it cost 76 dollars for two people . one pitcher of beer and two entrees . that is absurd ! would never go back .
0	managed to eat the paltry servings that were warmed up in the microwave , but definitely will not ever return for food at this establishment ever again . the draft beers were slightly over priced ( $ 6.00 for a 16 ounce pour ) but at least they were the same temperature as the food ~ cold ! ! the only bright spot of the evening was our server who was extremly attentive , very friendly and super courteous when dealing with our situation .
0	after visiting this location , and getting the $ 5 fill up combo , ive been sick , throwing up , i will never visit kfc again
0	my husband a taco salad and i wanted to try something new so i went with fajitas . whenever i see fajitas coming out they are engulfed with steam and you can hear them coming , well not my order it was barely hot . the beans tasted canned and guacamole was awful . we have been going to the one in phoenix and scottsdale for years and always loved it . it seems like the food and service is going downhill fast !
0	slapped a new bun on it and called good . uhm nope ! fries had a ton of oil but no seasoning . yuk . in the 40 minutes i sat here i watched 4 orders go back . seriously it was not that busy . last time i drive from east mesa for this
0	my boyfriend got the torta del rey ~ the rubber " hot dogs " in it ruined it for me . it also smelled weird . too much going on maybe ? ick ! glad i didn 't order it ! i got the carne asade burrito instead . which actually means bean burrito with a few tiny pieces carne asade mixed in . that was really annoying . the beans did taste good though . over all extremely unimpressed with this place . maybe we went on a bad day , but neither of us think we 'll be back to find out . bummer !
0	the food was run low , meats were empty or dried to bottom of bins , and there was no salsa , chips , or guacamole . we were instructed that we would need to wait five minutes for the new freshly baked chips which actually took 20 minutes . a total of 40 minutes up to this point and we are still waiting for the manager to speak with us . avoid this location at all costs if you 're looking for a fresh meal and competent service from staff or management .
0	there were only a dozen or two dozen people there at least 10 people working behind the counter in the kitchen and they can 't get the orders out . place sucks
0	this was the third time i tried this restaurant hoping the service would get better . i will never return .
0	this was the night of the 4th of july so you would think they would have expected to be busy . after waiting for so long , i thought they should have at least had someone come out and tell the cars waiting in the drive through , that they had run out of everything besides steak and desserts so that everyone did not waste their time waiting in a very long and slow line . i 'm very disappointed by this taco bell .
0	don 't you think our time is valuable mr. manager ? how about let 's us and the 20 people behind us know your out of chicken so we can go somewhere else ? ! horrible customer service . words of wisdom ... put more chicken on the grill at dinner time especially on a friday .
0	this kind of service make sense why their other location went out of business .
0	so what is the point of a drive thru ? we have to come inside for anything we order apparently . waste of my time and completely unhappy with the service of this location . who came up with the idea of not serving certain drinks thru the drive thru . that 's poor management skills .
0	after waiting in the drive thru for about a half an hour with only three cars ahead of us , came home to open the bag with someone else 's order ... fail !
0	... food poisoning . .... it was 2 1 / 2 yrs since i ate there last ... i got sick then and i 'm getting sick now saturday and sunday in bed
0	this time tried to fool my wife into thinking that subway had closed early . the current time was 8 : 45pm and they close at 10pm . no respect and continued to treat my wife in a belittling way . is there a number i can call to fix this poor customer service ? ? ?
0	the last four times i 've been through they haven 't had any pizza . unacceptable . take the " pizza hut " sign down if you don 't sell pizza .
0	if i had written a review then it would have been 4 or 5 stars . what happened to this restaurant ? the chips used to be phenomenal ( sea salt ftw ) and the guacamole was fresh . now the chips are inedible and all the food tastes canned . the mexican restaurant across the street at red rock casino offers exceptionally better food . if you haven 't been to agave in a while , do not bother . if you are thinking about going , do yourself a favor and go anywhere else .
0	i didn 't know you could make food this flavourless . epic fail .
0	" i should have listened . this joint boasts a long wait time for simple to-go orders , bland ingredients , and sub-par salsas . asking them to hold the sour cream is a good way to ensure you 're getting sour cream . also , be sure to count your change back because i guess math isn 't an exact science in this wizard 's den .
0	restrooms are located in the hotel lobby , nowhere near restaurant ; needed a tour guide to get there ! terrible experience !
0	this place needs a minus star . we went in and waited about an hour before we got our food . by the the kids were done so we asked them to box it instead which took another 1 / 2 hour . this place is worthless . i can 't even remember if the food was good because i was so angry at the service ! !
0	the menu items were cheap . i went simple with 3 cheese enchiladas and i was very disappointed . they had almost no flavor , very bland . i guess you get what you pay for .
0	all signs said they opened at 11 : 00 am . we arrived a little early at 10 : 55 so we waited in the car till 11 : 00 , went and tried the doors , locked . we waited till 11 : 15 and still locked . even a couple employees were trying to get in and couldn 't . so we waited till 11 : 20 and gave up . we went to bw3 right next door , great food , great service , and they open when they said they would .
0	when we asked which menu items were included , the first server said anything on the menu was included . he left and the second server started taking our orders and told us some of the items we were ordering were not included . when it came to pay for some of the meals that weren 't covered by the voucher , the server charged us for one too many . when we protested , she refused to go back to check her records . the only saving grace was the bartender who poured extra tequila into our frozen margaritas . it was a good thing that we were with fun friends since that deterred us away from the server with the poor attitude .
0	half of our party had to leave because it took so long . we watched other tables be served that came in after us . when we tried to say something to the owner her response was " try doing what i do " i would not recommend this place . the food here is comparable to taco bell . i 'm being generous by giving one star
0	not coming here again . my butt cant handle the velocity in which their food exits my body . something was off . i 'm not risking another episode from taco hell
0	bad management . rude employees . gotta love it . do yourself a favor .. drive to the willoughby location .
0	i feel like vomiting just remembering our experience there . i don 't eat beef so we ordered flautas , burritos and tacos ( all chicken ) . it was the same mixture of gross , bland chicken in all three items . the chicken looks horrible , has a disgusting texture and lacks in flavor . also , the place is filthy like another reviewer mentioned . i didn 't dare to go the bathroom but there was paper on the floor under every single table.the health department needs to shut them down !
0	i was waiting in line knowing that the food i was going to get wasnt worth the wait . there 's really nothing wrong with the people that work there . the issue is that there is one cash register and one person taking your order . meanwhile there are 5000 guys in the back cooking the meals . they really need to open another register up . the food was eh but i wasn 't expecting anything much more . so one star for the bottleneck place .
0	pina colada was definitely lacking , superrrr watery . salsa is great , smooth and spicy ! chips were stale , even when we sent our basket back and asked for a fresh batch . tacos and nachos featured more stale chips / tortillas & watery queso . basically , the star is for the quiet outdoor seating and quick delivery of food to the table . but overall , don 't bother with this hole-in-the-wall .
0	he freaked me out by talking nonsense to me ( he spoke different languages " konichiwa , nihao , £ @ % # * ) to get my attention cause im asian ) he looked very weird and creepy ! i tried to ignore but he came to the table and sat in front of me creeping me out . food wasn 't worth its price ! very disappointed at the portion and the taste ! maybe not my day ! i thought it was close to my place so i gave it a try but first was also the last time .
0	ever since they opened this one i was super wxcuted but it 's crazy it never did taste the same and the ladies that are there really are kinda off stand off ish . they also have the stupidest policies like if you take your food to go you don 't get the chips and beans but still pay the same price , what ? ! why ? ! anyways they screwed up my order last night and made me go back no type of apology maybe some kind of free side offer nothing . idk i give this place chance after chance and there 's always something . that 's why i 'm writing this review . pretty annoyed
0	the chips were hard and tasteless . the guacamole tasted like chemicals and nothing like fresh avocado . the quesadilla could have been edible if not for the copious amounts of grease leaking out of it every time i tried to lift it to my lips .
0	overpriced , soggy , not very good ham and cheese bagel . blech ... waste of my money .
0	over priced steam table tacos with no flavor . i guess the only flavor you could add is to drowned it in hot sauce . i can 't believe how much of a rip off this was , high price , so little food with no flavor . meh ! i got a better huge meal of chinese food at love field in dallas .
0	i don 't think i 've ever been treated so terrible at any food place in my life ! ! ! i work at starbucks & know costumer service & how to be kind to costumers regardless the situation . i am always extremely sweet to any person working at food places because i know how stressful it can be ! she needs to be fired & i hope she never treats any customer as awful as she treated me today around 1 : 30pm ! day = completely ruined . learn how to be nice !
0	food was terrible . i had the fish tacos and my wife had the enchiladas .. the enchiladas smelled literally like throw up . fish tacos were sub par and it seems like no one cares about anything . the server acted like he was about to get a root canal and could care less . next time i 'll eat at taco bell before i come to border grill .
0	she told me and my daughter i didn 't know how to order . then handed me off to james the shift leader . alexia needs to quit or move to another position in the back where there 's no customer service .
0	nothing like spending 60 bucks then throwing it all up . very over rated . what a waste . a stomach ache and throwing up while on vacation . how.fun .... so very overpriced
0	the waitress didn 't even took our order and was hiding behind the bar after we asked her . we just paid our drink and went out . as we were paying we told the cashier about the bad service and she just said " i know " and " sorry "
0	all customers were there complaining i was waiting for my coworkers as i experienced nasty service she tried blaming her cooks , if she would have had better customer service skills my coworkers and i would have stayed now i 'm going to eat subway hopefully their customer service is 100x better than this robertos .
0	extremely poor service and they were rude . came in around 11 : 30am and menu featured all breakfast items except for tacos , burritos , and tortas . i ordered a carne asada burrito and it came on a plate with nothing else . no sides , no chips . no chips even when they sit you down at the table . complaint to manager and only gave 20 % off the check and one free dinner menu item next visit ( i don 't want to come back ) . this place doesn 't deserve the good yelp rating it has .
0	allegheny county health department shut them down for violations of unsafe temperatures , rat , mice & roach infestation .
0	boy has the quality here went down . breakfast burritos here this morning . bacon egg and cheese was all egg , very few pieces of bacon bits and had to really search to find a small small bit of cheese . same with sausage burrito . very bland no flavor . been coming here for years ... no more
0	the worst mexican food i 've ever had . i had a chicken taco and enchilada . taco was ok but the enchilada chicken reminded me of the smell of cat urine .
0	service is horrible . it took forever for our food to come out . i got the fish tacos and they were super breaded and hardly any fish . if you know real mexican food , i wouldn 't recommend loco partone .
0	this review is based on customer service only . my wife and i came in an hour before closing and we were treated very rudely by the bar manager . the staff was more interested in wrapping up for the night than taking care of customers . i will not patronize this business again .
0	food was not worth eating - left it on the plate . even the rest rooms were terrible . filthy , nasty , shit was in commodes , floors wet with urine . never again !
0	their food is pretty bad and i 'm for certain that my burrito was cooked in a microwave and then smothered with red sauce . the beans they use are definitely canned and probably the cheapest you can buy . i don 't know what kind of beans they were but they were a weird brownish gray color and i picked them out of my burrito . most mexican places use refried beans . this place they were whole and undercooked . yikes ! we were lucky that we didn 't get food poisoning .
0	i ordered a tea cut in half , verifying it with the speaker guy , with the man who took my money , and then again with the man who finally handed me my order ; alas it was not a half cut tea after all . i understand people make mistakes , but this experience was brutal .
0	this place was so bad ! maybe we came at a bad time , on the weekend when the area is dead but everything we ordered , tacos , burrito , quesadilla , chips ... were all terrible . i don 't give out that opinion lightly but the food was all cold with no flavor at all . we even ordered everything spicy and it was so bland . very disappointed will not be returning .
0	i really do , probably for personal reasons : i am always dragged there by the dumbest , most immature people i know and sand sucks unless you are actually at the beach . if you must go , fine , but just don 't ask me to go with you . i 'm glad i got that off my chest . in their defense , i have never had their food . so , that could be great and i could be missing out ... but , i doubt it .
0	the chicken was tasty and moist , but not really as flavorful as i would like .. the beef was just okay . i agree with everyone who says that the onions are way too salty . the beans are pretty bad actually , as is the salsa . it 's worth it if you want to just come and pick up a chicken ...
0	i called to see what was going on and my food still had not left for delivery . i tried explaining and the person on the other end called me a lair . i will never order from them again amazingly bad experience ! !
0	well the guacamole was spicy and the quesadilla was flavorless . definitely will not be back to this place !
0	not ! i walked in , then realized it was just another greasy , nasty , smelly ( like rancid fryer oil ) fast food place , yuk , i turned around and walked out ! don 't be fooled !
0	i called & they said their cut off street is baseline on power rd . i 'm on power & guadalupe . they gave me the number for jimmy john 's on power and ray i called them they said i 'm out of their 2mile delivery restriction and the closest one would be the one on power and southern so basically all i 'm hearing is that both refuse to deliver this is poor customer service ! i will never use either one of these locations or jimmy john 's in general to cater any more of our office parties after today
0	my understanding is that most employees were owed several weeks worth of pay . here , even after not getting paid , the employees stayed and worked and this is how they are treated ? ( same person owned all 8 of the stores in vegas ) sucks to work for someone that has absolutely not thought towards their employees and their well being ( and no , i do not work for them )
0	ordered 2 meals and 2 orders of chicken fries . they tasted as if they were cooked hours ago in old grease . ask for fresh food , worth the wait .
0	i found bacon and chicken in my vegetarian salad . they use the same tongs to toss the salads . pieces of one ingredient falls into the box of the next . if you have a food allergy or preference to abstain from anything on the food line do not eat here . i repeatedly told them i was a vegetarian and ended up with several types of meat in my salad .
0	all other locations of los favoritos are great , but this is by far the worst tasting food of all their locations that i have been to
0	ordered my old standby ( which has been good to me at the madison locations ) a bean , rice and cheese burrito with pico and hot salsa and it was barely warm . are you not reading your reviews owner ? seems like this temperature issue has been going on for a while . the rice was bland and watery as well . don 't think i 'll be going back to this location unless i read multiple reviews that show improvement . for now i 'll go the distance into madison where they know more about flavor and how to heat their food .
0	however , i will say that paying 14.00 bucks for a cold burrito is ridiculous . i have never felt so swindled in my life . would definitely rate this negative stars if i could .
0	wanted taco dinner with soft shells . they won 't give you them with plain meat . all there meat is pre made with all vegetables included . i can 't eat tomatoes so definitely not a place to go if you have certain food allergies .
0	it 's 6 : 30pm and no customers here . do not recommend this place .
0	i used to love it here but i just bellied up to the bar and sat there in a group of 5 people . it 's not busy , there are 4 bartenders and nobody even said hello for 10 minutes ! pass . do business somewhere else .
0	if i have to be intoxicated to enjoy a food , it just must not be very good . sorry , but roberto 's beef tastes like horse meat when you 're sober . it 's all gray and hard ... kinda reminds me of that scene from the movie animal house when they scared that horse to death and had to chop it up to fit it through the door . now i know where the poor creature ended up ! the place was also really filthy .
0	if you do not believe buy one and judge for yourself .
0	over 2 hr wait for a table , from an arrogant , and illegal manager ( trust me , i know his background ! ) . for that matter , i know for a fact that over 1 / 2 the staff is illegals . closed much of the time ( spanish , mexican , any holiday ... whatever , you name it , and they 're closed ) , so why bother the drive ? food is typical mex , at best . abs nothing to get excited over . lots of other , and better mexican restaurants in phx .
0	all you can taco 's sounds good .. except after the first two i never got the second order .. so after paying for two drinks and playing $ 20 worth of video poker i ended up paying almost $ 12 per taco , which were nothing to write home about .. of course i complained and security arrived to take a report ... wtf ? after much complaining and receipt presentation i managed to get a meal comped .. which would be the only reason i would ever set foot back into this place .
0	i don 't know what 's happened to this location but it 's really gone downhill .
0	i 'm impressed ! this is the longest i have ever waited at the drive-thru ! and guess what ? you can 't just up and leave , either !
0	when i informed the waiter , he couldn 't have cared less . i also sent them a message about what happened and no response .
0	the street fish tacos were less than stellar ( by far ) . dry and lackluster fish with not much thought put in the beans and rice . purple haze beer must have been tapped a few months ago . the chicken torta would have caused a rematch at the alamo ... however , the pastrami benedict was top notch . overall , the $ 120 spent on a friday night for a family of four was about as satisfying as a kick in the sack . bummer
0	a lot of homeless people loitering inside and outside sleeping i a booth taking two tables
0	a lot of people told me to try this place out the manager stephen is a jerk they messed up my order with my receipt still being in the restaurant he did not want to fix it he told me they always get tooken this guy does not be long to be a manager he does not fix his mistakes and they had a big nasty water bug crawling around in the restaurant and they said they always get that so it 's kind of ridiculous
0	at least in mexico city it is ... this was a quarter-inch thick grilled pork chop with little seasoning . it even still had the hard fat on it ! it was mixed with canned pineapple that i do not believe was even heated served with bland beans and even blander spanish rice . wife had bland chicken fajitas that were served with above bland rice and beans . kid also had the requisite quesadilla , and bland beans , rice . salad on side was nice addition . it was a bland iceberg cut up with one quarter of a tomato and had an italianny dressing . wut ? never again .
0	you have to make 3 lines depending on what meet u want ! ! ! ! really ? ? ? the asada tacos were cold and not fully cooked ! if u like medium rare then u would be ok ! ! manager was really helpful and got me some hot tacos didn 't have to wait that long to get them ! ! bottom line ! not worth the hour wait ! !
0	already seriously annoyed. it is friday night 6 pm labor day weekend there is one person behind the counter here. person that appears to be in the manager appears to be off in the corner just talking to someone watching this go by. there currently nine people in line. is someone doing drugs ?
0	sure where i live has a large spanish population , so we get some pretty decent grub . regardless , the food is bland , the rice had a weird flavor and you can get similar offerings out of your local grocers ' freezer and not leave the house . sorry , wish i could say better .
0	i used enjoy going to robertos , i always order to go , my order is not difficult " 3 rolled chicken tacos with cheese & sour cream only no guacamole . 8 of the 10 times i 've gone there this year have been wrong . my order has been completely wrong . i could totally just open the box of my to go order in front of the lady to double check my order , is that my job ? shouldn 't that be the businesses responsibility ? today i received 3 beef rolled tacos w / 2 of the tacos with cheese . this is the most pathetic business . i will never step foot in a robertos taco shop again .
0	as we speak i am on the shitter with massive boiling diarrhea . pollo loco got my ass burnin ! ! i suggest you dont go anywhere near this place unless you want rectal cancer . the chicken taste like they wiped it across the bathroom floors and the customer service , dont get me started on the customer service . not be racist but are they trying to hire any whites any time soon ? i have to read a fucken spanish dictionary before i walk in this fucken place . overall i 'd eat there again . it was alright ..
0	she couldn 't speak on the types of coffee ( or chose not too when i asked ) . didn 't give me back my change . had to wait 1-2 min to ask her where the lids were , while she conversed with another patron . i know the owner takes pride in his coffee , so this is to management . also found a nice coffee bean store on balmoral , with very friendly and informative peruvian lady . although they don 't serve fresh coffee , i would rather buy the beans and make it at home !
0	been here over 12 times because it 's the closest to my house but man i will be going to the centennial one because they actually pay attention to the order and the customer .
0	my children courteously placed orders from menu , but were ignored .
0	everything from .... cilantro dressing to marinade for chicken to sides to actual chicken ! ! ! ! how do u run out of chicken ! ! ? ! ? and that has happened to me twice ! the manager and owner really need to get ahold of the demand for service if they want to raise revenue ... or maybe they are ok ... just serving who they can with what they have . plus service is a joke ! most employees think it 's funny that they are out of supplies ! i don 't ! especially when u have already waited in their drive thru for over 20 mins to only hear .... " sorry .. we r out of chicken again ! ! !
0	the last three times i 've been here ( hoping for a different result ... what 's the definition of insanity ? ) , the food has tasted horrible . unfortunately , they just can 't keep up with demand of service and i 've actually seen employees get upset with customers simply asking for more salsa to-go ( happened to my friend , actually ) . i 've written this place off and won 't ever go back here .
0	my husband got his meal 15 minutes before i got mine and we were unable to dine together lest his food get cold . and the seafood enchilada , which i ordered in lieu of the special , was not to my liking . for all of the inconvenience , we were given a coupon for a free appetizer the next time we dine there . yeah , right , as though we would go back . i will stick with richardson 's / rokerij / dick 's hideaway in the future if i want great southwestern food . also , it was freezing inside . i agree with other reviewers who said that the food is bland and swimming in icky sauces .
0	each time i 've visited , the customer service has been poor . it 's almost as if the servers believe brusque abrupt service is acceptable in a restaurant setting . i will not return to endure their impatience and subpar demeanors . they 're not the only game in town .
0	i tried to order tacos on taco tuesdays and i was running late . i had a 5 mile drive to only make it before 12 : 00am . the guy told me i need to order 30 tacos in order to make a phone order . got there at 12 : 02am and he told me no i just missed it by 2 mins . i guess working in old town people can treat you however they want .
0	he was rude and insulting , if he was my employee i would fire him immediately .
0	both were lacking flavor , the chicken was worse than the carne asada . refried beans were bland , the avocado pasta salad was warm and weird , also not much flavor . the queso was delicious , but the chips were thick , yellow , and cold . just not my favorite style of chips . the corn salsa they serve with their chips was also very bland . i won 't be coming back .
0	food was average but overpriced compare to similar restaurants .
0	i know the old adage , you get what you pay for but i 'm honestly surprised it 's possible to even get food poisoning from taco bell since 90 % of their food is " just add water " fake crap . either way , lesson learned . the cheapest of cheap isn 't worth the bowel shattering explosions i 'm currently enduring .
0	although the sign says they open at 7 , they have the door open and are making food but the jerk behind the counter tells me they 're closed. maybe next time lock the door and treat everyone the same ! ! ! !
0	we will not be back , there are way to many choices for median food in the west valley . we should have driven to po po 's ...
0	they use the phrase soul food however there is definitely no soul in this food . the restaurants food didn 't have any flavor at all ; it was incredible plain . i have tasted more flavor from the seasoning packets at the grocery store . i recommend you go somewhere else and save your money . the only thing delicious here are the chips .
0	was told to come back ... " i don 't know , about 11-11 : 30 . " useless .
0	myself and my coworkers wanted to try this place because of the good reviews but once we tried to call in our order for pickup ( since we only have 1 / 2 lunch ) we we 're hung up on twice and then when we finally had a live person on the phone they proceeded to give us a hard time for having a large order , then they kept yelling at my coworker asking her questions and wouldn 't let her answer . she was so upset she finally just hung ! note to the business owner teach your staff some customer service skills . i understand lunch time is busy but no need to yell at a customer who is bringing you business ! !
0	debit card , this place need to get with it .
0	i would never recommend this location to anyone . i was waiting to place an order for 10 minutes and their were 3 people working that night and not 1 even bothered to help me . they were more focused on the drive through .
0	the food always makes me feel like i can make it at home which defeats the entire purpose of going out for dinner . the main reason i have gone back is because my friends enjoys the margaritas and i am always willing to give a place with tacos another go . everytime has been a let down . honestly its my least favorite place in madison .
0	food is crap 75 % of the time . by far the worst chipotle i 've ever been to .
0	all of the workers are incompetent . the good workers they get always somehow don 't work there long ( probably for good reason , they 're too good for the job ) . this place is terrible . my food order is never right . never coming to this taco bell anymore . tear it down and put in another starbucks . save us the trouble !
0	every time i 've gone through , we 've waited 20-30min . last night around 9 : 30 pm we waited 30min .. there was only one car in front of us . i got so annoyed i just drove straight through and left the drinks . worst location ever ! always understaffed and my drink gets made different every time . i 'm going to corporate .
0	the staff are all really rude and act like they don 't even want to be there . they even have completely forgotten about my order while i stood there a good ten minutes and everyone of the staff members were walking around talking to each other and cutting up . finally i asked where my order was to then be told that someone had erased it by accident . they didn 't even bother to try to get right on my order either they still just stood around talking . if i would have not already paid i would have just walked out .
0	today arrived at 7 : 41 and female employee turned the sign to close and locked front door . i had just turned my car off and was annoyed . owner needs to know his staff are closing earlier than 8pm posted closing time-cardinal sin in food business
0	i have yet to see them get an order right .
0	the patty was dry , stale and didn 't have much flavor . the jerk chicken meal tasted like steamed chicken . it was tasteless . there wasn 't even any skin on the meat . it was almost as if they ran out of jerk seasoning and decided to mix the remainder of the sauce with water to stretch it .. from now on i will stick to what the reviews state !
0	hire some americans that can read english and the order , and maybe the order would not end up being wrong !
0	i don 't think the meat gets cooked fully . they need to practice defrosting procedures better .
0	it is strangely slow for how busy it seems . i am writing this review because i attempted take out and received awful service . my order which i viewed on the line sitting for 11 minutes was finally given to me after the guy realized that he " effed up " and yes he actually dropped the f bomb . apparently abandoning food isn 't worthy of taking ownership in an appropriate way . manager please reach out . i know you spoke with me that night and referred me to this foul mouthed individual with a beard handling cold food .
0	or lack there of visit . one time its missing two burritos , another time there was a long blonde hair in my burrito . another time they closed 10 min before their posted closing time . * always check your bag before pulling out of drive thru * *
0	then jumps over to assist with food prep . so , i asked for her coworker to make my food and poor hygiene girl made a snide comment under her breathe . never again .
0	if you 're going to close at 7 : 45 then thats what should be posted on your sign not 8 : 00 . its a burrito . it 'll take about 4 minutes to cook
0	got to work opened bag had med french fry large hash brown a western bacon cheeseburger an some mystery looking burrito . tried calling 3x keep getting fax machine doubt i 'll come back to this location . trying to give this a one star rating only because i have to but yelp has put it at 3 stars and i can 't seem to fix it
0	after waiting forever , order is consistently messed up .
0	food was good but customer service was terrible . manager was a complete * * * hole and we don 't plan on ever going back .
0	beyond annoying that every time i have come to this location and ordered a grilled chicken salad they always forget the dressing ! ! ! get with it ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	always ask for no pigs foot and they always add it . they might think this is funny . that 's okay . going to el mirage from now on . added picture .
0	always check your order before you leave . & ask for a reciept. like if my total was 8.23 they round it to 8.25 .. they 've done it to me many times on the drive thru .
0	we keep going here occasionally out of convenience and they never fail to either forget something or out wrong item in the bag . go to the one on waddell and litchfield .
0	staff in a hurry and throws your food around . they act like you are bothering them .
0	they are open until 10 but refuse to cook past 8 : 30 . why stay open ? this has happened to me numerous times and when i confronted management ; they act like i am lying . i emailed corporate . let 's see if anything happens from that .
0	chicken strips always tast like they are old - left overs from day before ? ? ? their workers are always grouchy . go the extra couple miles and visit the kfc on van buren .
0	you 'd think that if you run out of the same thing everyday at the same time you would make more and adjust to your business ? so if anyone orders a salad after 8 , they can 't have dressing for their salad ? this is company wide by the way but this location is the worst with it . another trip ; guac had no taste / no salt . white rice seems as if they forgot to add lime juice to it . this location is the only one i 've ever had issues with . what 's the deal ? ? ?
0	i 'm thinking that was a mistake . first of all , we have been to a lot of mexican restaurants and have never seen a menu like this , it was basically foreign to my fiance and i. we both had some questions about a few things on the menu that we planned to ask our waitress . only when the waitress came to take our order we discovered that she barely spoke any english . when our food came it wasn 't what either one of us expected . apparently i ordered a chicken quesadilla , which i wrongly assumed was going to be enchiladas . food was very bland . needless to say , we wont be going back .
0	everytime i go , its closed. and when asked what time are they open , they dont know ... really ? ! interesting .... close your business , no point in being open ! customer service always sells not the product. people and businesses like theres , always puts a bad reputation to the hispanic families that are hard workers with excellect work ethic. mal servicio seguro. lastima de productos .
0	i just left after sitting in the drive thru for 10 mins . went to jack in the box and i am already leaving with food . this location is alwaya super slow , especially on a satuday night . last time i was here on a saturday i waited for for 20-30 mins . they are simply super slow
0	at least this time i did not get the nearly 2 foot piece of hair in my fajita burrito . why many people i know , including my wife like to go to this place is beyond me .
0	looking for a new zabas to go to ... ugh
0	this time the lady at the counter was terrible.didn 't care about whether we were ordering food or not she was busy watching the tv . when i was ordering i had to repeat my order a couple times because her focus was on the hispanic news channel . do you know how annoying that is ? tables were not clean and there 's food & paper on the floor . foods gone south like the customer service . sorry last time eating here for me and my family .
0	very condescending , thanks missy first and last time thanks
0	i ordered the shredded beef , and he used the tongs to scoop the meat and placed it in the burrito . he then proceeded to take off a sizable portion of the meat off the rice and beans and back into the tray . i told him i had just worked out and would like the full scoop / portion . he put it back on and said he was going to charge me extra . the female employee chimed in saying it was one scoop per burrito and i explained i had only one scoop and before he removed some . after this i left to go eat elsewhere .
0	overrated , overpriced , over complicated food ! my salad was anything but colorful , the lettuce was yellow ! ! ! you are better off going to filibertos . sol is another north scottsdale fancy version of food that should be kept fresh and simple .
0	horrible service . we were first to arrive this morning and not one of 10 employees would assist us when restaurant was otherwise empty . hostess would not lead us to table or patio and table was filthy . my boyfriend and i laughed out loud and then walked out . simply awful !
0	amazing food , but not amazing enough to charge over 34.00 for 2 burritos , i guess they are charging us customers for your moving expenses to new location , i didn 't ask u too move .... new prices way over priced .... just lost a weekly customer ....
0	every time i go to this location is like a trip to idiot island . the employees act as if the customers are annoying little gnats interrupting their dull conversations . i have yet to receive an order that is correct , but like a moth to the old flame i go back because the food itself is still pretty darn good . until today . i phoned in a takeout order , which usually results in a look of awe like you just landed in your spaceship . cold and runny food , no ice , and no lemonade , i think i 've finally learned my lesson . however , tomorrow is coconut shrimp taco tuesday so no guarantees .....
0	that 's about it . service is below average . food is subpar . very small portion . salad looks so tired and tastes tired . meat is too rough to be chewable . even fried calamari is unchewable . disappointing experience .
0	ambience was cool at first , i dined outside to watch the sunset , as soon as it got dark you could see cockroaches running round everywhere , when i got my $ 29 skirt steak it tasted like it had been frozen for a year & dethawd and the rice & beans tasted like they came straight from a can , the staff including the manager were extremely rude & had a " you need us we don 't need you attitude " probably bc the area is pretty much a ghost town w the exception of 3other restaurants .. place is probably shutting its doors soon so no need for anything fresh
0	americanized orange chicken . refried beans and steamed rice . put that all into a box as a combo and they call it " fusion . " if trump advertised a panda sporting a thick mexican ' stache wearing a sombrero , he 'd receive hell on earth for being racist . i think it 's good humor . but please be more imaginative with the food and quality .
0	no beans , no rice , and apparently no fresh guacamole . the menu claims that the guacamole is prepared " table side . " instead i received what i would classify as a cereal-bowl-sized serving . this cereal bowl came out appearing to be thrown together at some point during the day ( hopefully ) and then tossed into the fridge until some ill informed customer orders this $ 12.50 " fresh " not fresh dish . how can an airport in such a mexican affluent area serve " mexican " dishes over ... fries ... ?
0	a mess .... unorganized no line control ... sad , made it to line 1 , two tacos on our tray ... and left cause we could not take the unnecessary chaos just to procure a quick lunch
0	cold potato , cold bacon , tasteless scrambled eggs and salad . oh and the worst luke warm stale coffee . maybe the fare is better for later meals but give breakfast a miss
0	it 's extremely bland . if you go bring spices with you & not just the hot stuff they just heat the food and bring it out . maybe it 's for americans that don 't actually like mexican food .
0	am i going to be the first regular customer to say the tortillas suck ? let me know when you bring back the old tortillas .
0	i find the food to be greasy and tasteless . the chips and salsa are good though . last week i decided to try the avocado chicken salad . it was served in a crunchy bowl which was nice . unfortunately the two tomato slices on top were inedible . they were green and i couldn 't even stab them with my fork . i also tried the fried ice cream . it was made with some cheap vanilla ice cream that would not even melt when left sitting in the dish for 10 + minutes . i really don 't understand the appeal of this place ! the rest room is disgusting too !
0	this is texmex at best , but poorly executed . you can have better texmex at chipotle . the worst part is they advertise it as " authentic mexican " and it 's far from the truth . if you want afordable , everyday authentic mexican go to los rebozos or fonda lola . if you want high-end authentic mexican go to el catrin or los colibries . this is a a shame , considering la tortilleria sells authentic tortillas and their mexican sauces are excellent . not sure what went wrong .
0	i get there at about 4 : 45 and there 's an open sign on their door but the door is locked . wth ! i was highly pissed off ! doubt i 'll ever give them another try .
0	i told her where i was working and she isn 't to fond of the place apparently . decided to be rude and not give me a chance to get a word in.after explaining her reasons why . i tried wishing her a good day ... answered with a " don 't tell me what to do , then repeatedly told me to get out . honestly i threw the food i bought out , cause i was too scared to eat something from a mean , grumpy old lady . someone bring her home and keep her there .
0	this is a shame .... these guys have no standard . i don 't care about the 30 words . a drive through is speedy and not what these boys promise . done with farmer boys or girls .
0	andrea who said she was the manager in the drive-through at 5 : 02 after waiting five minutes for the two cars in front of me said at 5 : 02 that happy hour was over and then she wants to play games and asked me how happy am i ? well andrea i 'm a one star happy right now how happy are you i 'm going to report this
0	they accidentally gave me beef instead of shrimp and i asked for them to replace it and they didn 't . i asked to speak to a manager and then the employee told me to go " go fuck yourself you dirty little jew bag " and yelled at me to leave . i am jewish and i was wearing a silver star of david necklace and i feel truly offended i would rather eat out of a dumpster than go back there
0	i went there hoping for an authentic paella valenciana , and ended up with a slightly soupy mess . the rice was not dry and crispy on the bottom ( the sign of a classic paella valenciana ) , the seafood tasted like it was boiled . the shrimp were not deveined . when i brought it up to the waiter his response was that was how they make it there . well , good to know , because i now know exactly were to go if i do not want authentic spanish paella valenciana in cleveland . i will not be going back there .
0	honestly , the new owner got rid of what made this place special : authentic food .
0	my wife proposed to order small portions ( and lucky we were ) . best part was the service , the food was tasteless and bad and over priced . i seriously wanted to call 911 for they murdered the mexican food . never ever , stepping back to this restaurant , unless things change for better . i have to post a star to post the review , else i would love to get away with 0 stars
0	every single dish tried was boring , tasteless and drowned in some sort of sauce or " salsa . " i never thought it was possible to screw up mexican food . i had fish tacos that were greasy cheap looking fish sticks in a tortilla . their shrimp diablo was an entertaining sight ... since when are tiny cocktail shrimp used as an entrée ? ? the cocktails and service were good and i definitely loved the decor . get a new chef and the money will flow ! come on ... this is vegas baby ! ! !
0	the guacamole was so hot inedible had to get and pay an additional 81 cents for a small dab of sour cream . the tacos were filled with a batter dipped tough piece of fish for spending 18.00 plus the extras not worth it . no one asked me or indicated that i would not be able to get rid of the burn-
0	ordered by phone for pick up and none of the specifics of the order were fulfilled . even with the wrong order , ( black instead of pinto , no veggies when specifically asked for extra veggies , white instead of whole wheat , the spice levels for all orders were wrong ) the burrito wasn 't wrapped properly , the meat lacked any spice or flavour . never again !
0	anna was very rude to us and the food had no flavor.the beans and salsa are from a can.very disappointed
0	also , being out of tacos on taco tuesday is just wrong . especially with the new competition in town , that got my money tonight ..
0	it wouldn 't hurt to add a tad bit more chicken to your 25 $ fajitas plate and maybe even give more tortillas without charging a buck . i can understand the high cost of being located in treasure island as rent is not cheap . however maximizing profits is one thing and just gipping customers is another .
0	why can they make good al pastor tacos . don 't even use real corn tortillas . the only good thing was the horchata .
0	another establishment here in vegas it doesn 't understand service. stayed at the front right where we should have been seated took 10 minutes just for them to come and seat us even though we were the only people standing there. obviously we just laugh because if they can 't see people in a timely manner how the rest of the service be .
0	very overpriced , very disapointing . don 't waste your hard earned money .
0	things were going well until about halfway through the chicken tostada salad when a giant piece of chicken skin was discovered . luckily i did not eat this or possible choking would have occurred . the skin was tossed away , but the mental damage was done . poor avondale residents must endure crappy chains their whole life . i 'm out of this town today .
0	another night at don ruben 's food outstanding as usual however the wait was extremely long because the lady at the front forgot where our name was and called five couples that came in after us and we were standing outside in the rain. not rain we were actually in the rain because we were underneath the awning however the point is is not really a service this trip
0	who makes the customers in line wait 5 + minutes to put together an order for a pick up order ? ! it would make more sense to cater to the customers in line waiting .
0	this place has gone down from 5 stars to 1 star . food quality is not the same anymore . dried overcooked meats is just a no no . it seems they keep everything precooked in the fridge and just heat it up . not the same quality from 10 months ago . seems they have tried to save money and its costing them points on the taste department . and the service ... just horrible . crancky ladies taking orders . give you attitude and make you hesitate to ask for something . that itself makes this a 1 star . bring back the quality and employees from before ! !
0	after looking at it and waiting for service for awhile , we mentioned we were new and needed help and were told to spend time with the menu ... which we had already done for awhile . it is chipotle style with various options . please note , they have onions in all of their meats so if you are allergic or have a disposition against them , this is not the place for you . we went elsewhere .
0	my quesadilla had shredded lettuce that was shredded so fine it resembled a green blob . by the way , iceberg lettuce fucking sucks . it tastes like hell , is primarily water , is cheap as shit , and has no nutritional value . the diced tomatoes were from a can . salsa was bogus & chips were not home made . the bean & chz. burrito was deflated as an old tire & tasted like one . it was all tortilla .... in a nutshell , this is nothing but bar food . nothing authentic here . f. this place .
0	this is probably the 10th bad experience i 've had at a big burrito restaurant . usually it 's mad mex , but this time it was kaya . i walked in and asked for a table for two and a half . the hostess who didn 't make eye contact with me , informed me there was nothing but outside seating available . it 's funny because there was over half the room available inside . her claims over reserved tables were unwarranted , there were plenty of tables open and weren 't being seated for another 45 minutes . avoid this dump .
0	i could go on and on but to frustrated with this place and the incompetents , plus the i don 't care attribute . they are constantly screwing up orders even after repeatedly asking them if they could repeat the order . i even tried to speak with them about why my orders are lately constantly getting my orders wrong , i was told they don 't care . this is another example where a business doesn 't appreciate your patronizing .
0	i was off work vomiting and with the runs for 3 days . i haven 't been back and do not intend to go there .
0	we stopped for lunch and ordered a caldo de res and a carne asada . the caldo was so salty we could not eat it . the carne asada y as a tough cut of meat without any flavor . tortillas we 're hard .
0	any company that would write disparaging messages on a customer 's receipt should be run out of business. what are you like 3 years old
0	service - lousy ! food was tasteless , poorly prepared . how can israeli place screw up basic schwarma is beyond me ( as an example ) my grilled chicken was undercooked , israeli salad had no salt , no taste .... overpriced , below mediocre - stay away ! we all know of untrue , plain fraudulent reviews . when i read people saying that this place is any good - all lies !
0	service was horrible , margaritas tasted like cheap mix with virtually no tequila and the food itself was borderline inedible . there 's a taco bell on sardis north and you would be better off going there . i 'm serious . this place is horrible .
0	i was really disappointed to say the least when i was served a plate of soaked tortilla chips in a pasty , canned-tomato sauce ... my husband said his huevos rancheros were ok , but then again he 'll eat anything . the place was getting pretty full for lunch , so maybe other menu items were better phoenix , az 85008than the sad and pathetic dish that i got .
0	i grew up in az from a very large mexican family and mexi casa is terrible . the meat tastes like precooked frozen crap u get in the freezer aisle . the chicken meat even had freezer burn . the chips come straight out of the bag cold and stale . the salsa is absolutely flavorless . my friend for some reason reallllly wanted to eat here . i was so disgusted with the food he paid for the entire meal and he agreed that i would from now on i choose all mexican restaurants we eat at .
0	everything about our meal was bad . we had a reservation and still had to wait 20 minutes the margaritas were an absolute joke . we had to send them back ... they came back with new ones and they tasted just as watery as before . chips and salsa - mediocre drunken chicken nachos - not good .. watery .. no flavor mahi mahi tacos - not bad .. a little bland but not terrible .. the beans that accompanied it were awful though margarita - arguably the worst margarita i 've ever had
0	terrible food . thats all . if you like the taste of paper and hot sauce you found the right place . enjoy .
0	the taste of the beans taste like mexican beans . the pork chucks ordered were saturated in oil . any cuban knows that pork is supposed to be accompanied with limes , which at this restaurant they do not even offered with the food , the rice was extremely dry . i am sorry , but for real cuban food please don 't waste your time . go to miami one day , and taste the real cuban food .
0	i was dragged by a coworker into this place for lunch , it made me sick .. i felt like i was holding onto my baby 's soggy wet diaper .. disgusting beyond belief ..
0	you have to use a lot of salsa on it . i call it gringo food . have been there 5 or 6 times , it 's always the same .
0	as i was waiting for my drink i looked up to see him pointing at me and laughing with a co worker . i don 't know what was said but it made me super uncomfortable .
0	it wasn 't luciano garden though . she said that during the day ( when i was there ) , it is called homemade pancakes and during the night it is called ital-spain . oh my god . oh wait ... i passed by today and it looks to be closed . need i say more ?
0	i had the chicken mas grande ; overcooked rice , bland and a hair ... disastrous . never again .
0	it took 45 minutes just to order ! when we ordered the only meat options were pastor and tongue so everyone in my group got pastor something . we took it to go and when we ate it in the room half of us got the shitters after 10 minutes of eating the food . the burrito itself was a 3-4 star . customer service was sub or but what do you expect from a run down taco place . if you have a strong stomach and a lot of patience then this is the place for you . otherwise you 're better off with another place around town .
0	oh and make sure there are no vegetarians in your group they will be sorely disappointed even more than you
0	place is grungy . food is grossly overpriced and downright bad . staff are weird , not unpleasant , just seems like their first day on the job . used to come here all the time , used to be amazing . had similar experiences twice in the past two months . dinner for 2 with no dessert or coffee is , no exaggeration , twice as expensive as grand electric . not even in the same conversation , quality-wise . i will never go back . i urge anyone reading this to never go .
0	the list goes on and so should you . i didn 't want to put too much effort into this review , because it isn 't worth it to help businesses that don 't want to improve . if someone could get a chipotle open in this neighborhood , it would be much appreciated and frequented . the food was not one star , but the experience as a whole will ensure that i savage them anytime their name comes up . life is too short for mediocre , and i like supporting businesses that like to be in business .
0	a peace of shit frys shit costumer service and shit mangers fuck this frys and people and people who work there two
0	including tortillas for tortillas for fajitas . would of been excellent but couldn 't drive all the way back for tortillas n sour cream defeats reason we had it pick up
0	brown with too much agave nectar , warm from lack of ice , using the slightest amount of a house tequila i 've never heard of . this margarita reveals a lack of appreciation for the spirit supposedly represented . what a tremendous disappointment . the tequila list is fair - but nothing you can 't find retail at a nearby liquor store . and the food is average . but i can 't imagine the situation that will take me back to wedge .
0	food was tasteless and staff / service was horrible . we all felt like we were bothering the waitress . we ordered 6 meals and not one was flavorful . there are too many wonderful restaurants to choice from , this not being one !
0	i was feeling really lousy and thought it was because i hadn 't eaten in over 24 hours since my stomach had yet to recover from yesterday 's disaster of a lunch . so i ate a light salad now i feel even worse . it 's possible the disgusting meal i forced down at arriba yesterday which left my dining companion and me with what we thought was severe indigestion has actually spurred a mild case of food poisoning
0	the food was mediocre , the service terrible , and the prices far too high for this lack of quality . we ordered a pitcher of margaritas and were disappointed there as well . the margaritas lacked any real taste and we were charged $ 35 for the pitcher ( price not listed on the menu ) . when we tried to voice our concerns to the manager , we were told too bad , that 's the way it is . this place is just a tourist trap in old town scottsdale .
0	uninspired and bland food choices . seems to be typical for champaign-urbana : (
0	while we ordered different items , i do not at all in my right mind recommend the burrito bombero , or in that case anything on the menu . - and the other listing which says los taquitos mexican grill , is the same place as this one , do not know why it is listed twice
0	i know now that the sign says 1 : 00 am . she actually means 12 : 40 . what makes it worse is that i called to ask if they we 're still open at 12 : 40 . the reply i received was " my office computer says 1 : 02 , we can 't serve you . " i wasn 't looking for a big order . and no assistance ! this place is garbage ! ! !
0	i 'm assuming they had just put it away already and did not want to get it out as they were cleaning and were clearly annoyed with having to serve food . i love chipotle and never have any problems with the quantity of food or the service until tonight . i will not be back due to this experience .
0	last visit here unfortunately. this place used to be great
0	i stood in line and when it was my turned i ordered 4 tacos and the girl looked at me as though i was crazy . she did not know what i was talking about , i told her tacos , you know like in jack in the box and she responded " we don 't have tacos , try a mexican restaurant . " i couldn 't believe she was so rude . however , i notice that las vegas restaurants don 't carry alto of the stuff restaurants in california do .
0	also , the meat was very salty , which always make me suspicious of the quality .
0	moral of the story . only deal with reputable businesses . in my opinion , this is not one .
0	when i asked if they sold posole i was hung up on . rude . n seriously the health department should probably be called . i didn 't know asking if they sold a product that i wanted would be an issue . im sorry im white i guess . rude people shouldn 't be working in customer service .
0	poor service for yankee doodle mexican food . will not be back .
0	it was a good thing we were starving that we got through our meal .
0	bunch of kids closing up early on a saturday night instead of treating their customers right .
0	this is the saltiest food you will ever eat in your life . the kiss of death of restaurant seems to be drive ins diners and dives , because every place i have gone to that hes been has been terrible . i can tell you for drinks and guacamole , this place rocks . but steer clear of the entrees , they are way over priced and exactly what you would expect cleveland mexican food to be , wretched . its trendy and living off its recent tv appearance , but i don 't think it will be around once the novelty wears off ..
0	good to know in the future . couldn 't have made an exception or anything . thank you . not coming back
0	lol . because he had too much change in his register , it was my fault . but it 's okay , i went across the street to sinclair and the lady was super sweet and the gas station looked much nicer .
0	gave it a try today-sorry can not recommend . i don 't like eating out of aluminum pans . and the navajo taco wasn 't up to quality standards . old , dried meat . i don 't like writing bad reviews , but this one fits .
0	this was my first and unless every other place like this ( cafe rio , zabas , chipotle etc ) in town closes down ; this will be my last visit . ok . let me take that back ... even if they all close down i feel comfortable saying i 'm never willingly coming back . the place was empty so maybe the food that they prepped dried and withered while waiting on customers ? all i know is that the portions were small and flavorless . the staff was less than enthusiastic and the place was dirty . maybe the weekend staff is not up to par and hopefully this wasn 't their best day . hopefully your experience is better .
0	sure , gizmo is happy , but no one else is . what kind of huge fast food chain doesn 't accept a debit card ! ? a communist one , that 's who . they like to brag about all day breakfast , but only with exact change and a polka dance to go with it . absolutely ridiculous establishment .
0	salad was supposed to have " mixed greens " but was almost entirely shredded ice berg lettuce - not very impressive for $ 9 . no domestic beers were available and low quality costa rican beer cost $ 6.50 . the atmosphere was no where near nice enough to justify this kind of cost . they charge $ 2 extra to have tofu in a dish vs. meat . what kind of steak is so cheap that switching to tofu adds $ 2 ? the waiter basically disappeared after the food was served - embarrassed by the feedback he might get ?
0	in az tap water makes a different 2 . waiting 20 minutes for menus , water , and chips ( that never came ) is not ok 3 . cleaning our own table from spilled salsa is not ok 4 . charging us for a quesadilla and not bringing it , not ok ! ! ! 5 . i will not be back ...
0	picked up 4 burritos yesterday , service was slow . flavor was not that good , and i think i bit into a piece of raw pork in my burrito . grossed me out and i ended up throwing the rest away freling sick . will never go back . good luck eating here .
0	are homeless people really sitting in here sleeping all day ? what the fuck is this shit .
0	are used to go to this place a few times but lately snotty service the food is ok it 's just a rundown place that you can do a lot better , i just can 't sit at a place it 's depressing it 's like sitting in some russian gulaog ! !
0	go to the bar and order 2 margaritas with salt on the rocks - cost ? $ 30 . ask for an ipa and they bring me a clone of stella artois for $ 14 . ( and not a good clone at that ) . overpriced , overrated and just ok food . save the money , the time , and your effort - go somewhere else . and then we got the food ... no problem paying big money for food ... but hey - that sucked too . just about every bistec taco from a taco wagon has been better . am i bitter ? heck yeah . am i wrong ? ummm no .
0	do they really call this mexican food ? ! ! ! ! wow , cant believe its food . only thing i liked in there was the sodas and the sopapillas , that 's it . everything else was not a pleasant taste ! ! ! ! i would not recommend this place what so ever ! ! !
0	first thing we noticed , there was no a / c in this place by the way it was 110 outside . then we ordered one burrito and two tacos . al pastor and carne asada meats were real bad but buche was ok . i am not sure who writes the other reviews but for sure i will never come back to this place even for free .
0	or at least that 's what it looked like !
0	the lady at the drive through here didn 't want to hand me my drink until i handed her my card ! haha really ? ? ! ! my girlfriend was fumbling through her purse to find the debit card and i tried to reach for the drink she was handing me out of the drive through window and she immediately pulled the drink back and said , " um ... how about you pay me first . " do i look that untrustworthy ? talk about making a customer feel low ! i guess she thought i was going to drive off with a fountain drink and leave the rest of the order ... what a joke !
0	this is seriously getting sad ! every time i come to this location , i never know what i 'm going to end up with ! the tacos were cut short of their insides and then i received the wrong quesadilla ugh ! ! ! ! ! so annoying ! why oh why can 't you people follow the instructions for the amount of food that needs to go into a taco ! ! !
0	$ 7 of my hard earned money in the trash ! unacceptable !
0	we were there today before the giants exhibition game . all 6 of us thought our entrees were terrible . sensing we were less than pleased the young waiter told us we should have asked him for his opinion before we ordered . dude , if you have the key to the secret menu share it ! one guy in our party ordered the caesar with chicken with the dressing on the side . it came out wrong and when by the time it was replaced the rest of us were long done with our entrees . oh yeah . he threw a tip on the bill ( i assume because we were a party of 6 ) . what a tool .
0	40 minutes in line ! i shouldn 't have even waited but it got to be almost a joke how long it was taking . how can this place stay in business ? when we finally got up to the window to pay , the employee at the register asked me how i was doing . really ? i asked him why it had taken so long , and he said that they were really understaffed ( yet i could see another employee behind him at the register leaning on the counter b.s.ing with someone for awhile ) . based on similar reviews about the poor service , this is a regular occurrence . the manager should be fired !
0	you have got to go to carolina 's on cactus rd. and cave creek .
0	we waited 1.5 hours for a table of 12 . the food here isn 't filling at all . it 's more for a snacking . i didn 't find the quality of the food to be all that at all . i would 've been more satisfied eating at taco bell ( sad right ? ) . i feel like the only reason this place is as packed and rammed as it was is because location location location ! i 'd never go back here again for the food that 's for sure .
0	the burrito is tiny , what the f , i 'm a man with a concept of value , this is crazy . adding a pic with my hand for reference
0	grilled fish tacos contained as much fish as a small anchovy . don 't know how they kept it from falling through the grill . the chicken taco soup should be called chicken cumin soup . my last visit .
0	horrific . honestly . couldn 't even drink it , and i don 't know that i 've ever left a frozen drink on a table before , much less when i 'd opted for a " yarda . " nachos also significantly subpar . avoid at all costs .
0	i spit my food out instantly . if i am sick tomorrow it 's because filibertos .... never ever again i go to this place . 0 stars is more deserving .
0	this restaurant has been my favorite for years and i could not believe my eyes when i saw it i so discussed i 'm writing this as i 'm in the drive threw to get my money back there place is pack right now and i hope this does happen to anyone else ..... man did i want some shredded beef tacos now i can 't even think of tacos please check your food before you eat ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! update : when i told the lady she had complete attitude with me like if i put it in there ! ! ! ! ! !
0	when you work hard to enjoy a meal it is our desire to go to places worthy of our hard earned money . what else can i say ? you want our money please upgrade . double check ... triple check . or bypass all together .
0	we gave them multiple chances over the last year but we won 't be going back . i 'm not going to write a negative short story about the last 3 visits but i could . i 'll just say on one occasion the mini chimis came out frozen in the middle and on our last visit we got some bad chicken ... as in make you sick chicken . : ( the management didn 't even come over and comp anything . that 's really bad service . i will miss their spinach enchiladas .
0	" bland food / large quantities / cheap prices . go here if you plan on throwing up sometime soon , or if you are a glutton for punishment .
0	sat at the bar and ordered a lunch special assuming it would be fairly quick . after about 20-25 minutes of waiting with zero contact with anyone as to why i was still waiting , i had to leave . there was only 10 customers there so no idea what the issue was . if you are going to make someone wait that long for a lunch special , you have to communicate why . walked out .. now i am back in the office .. hungry ..
0	seated ourselves on the patio as usual . we frequent this location . but not anymore . it 's 212pm and and we have received chips and salsa , and a menu but no service . no order even after my wife went in and asked for the server . seems the place is back to the ridiculously bad service we have had some years ago ! good luck .
0	no problem - we ordered margaritas and enjoyed the chips and salsa . at 8 : 45 , we inquired about our table and we were told that it would be another 15 minutes . at 9 : 00 , we inquired again about our table and we were told it would be a " minute or two . " at 9 : 15 , we inquired again and we were told we were " next up " on the list . at this point we gave up and went to a local favorite called firefly . we were seated immediately , the service was awesome and the food was just as great ! so skip the poorly managed javier 's and head to firefly !
0	they must start being " closed " about an hour before closing time , won 't be back
0	if you say open until 10 then stay open until 10 or find new employees !
0	waited 15 min wile waiters passed us to seat us . never seated us just left . lazy service . won 't be going back .
0	arrived at the drive thru 2 : 09pm took the order at 2 : 10 been in the lane since 2 : 26 ? that 's a long time for a drive thru .
0	they close at 9 : 00pm . i sat in line until i reached the window at 9 : 25 . i was upset at the long wait and asked the man working the drive thru if a 45 minute wait was an acceptable wait time . he told me it was and if i didn 't like it , walk up to the window to order next time . horrible attitude and then flipped me off as i left . food was ok , but not worth the wait . never returning . if they really want to rip off pete 's fish n chips , they should at least work on matching their service . good luck ! i would leave 0 stars if allowed .
0	was told everything outside and inside was reserved and then offered a table next to the restroom . do not recommend this place .
0	service is non-existent . they wouldn 't acknowledge our presence . table was dirty . we waited at least 10 minutes , then left . this location is a turkey . no need to waste your time there .
0	not many patrons at that time , we placed our order and waited , and waited for our meals . after about 20 mins. was told the order is coming up soon , another 5 mins. later and it finally came . one dish was cold , and needed to be sent back , while i had the worst steak fajitas . the beef ? had the softest texture to it like it had sat in water for 3 days , definitely not an enjoyable meal . i had to eat my meal while the wife waited for hers to get re-heated . all i can say is adios " on the border " we 're never coming back ! ! ! ! !
0	we were told it would be a 20-25 minute wait , but were seated after only 10 minutes . just as well since no one offered to serve us in the 10 minutes at the bar . our waiter was prompt and courteous . the four tapas we ordered came out extremely quickly . unfortunately , this seems to be due to the fact that everything had been prepared well in advance . the bread seemed several days old . very disappointed by the quality of the food . too loud to hold a conversation .
0	their was plenty of strip booths available but the hostesses said they were reserved . never again will i dine here , hostesses are saving best seats for their hispanic friends , they treat caucasians very bad here , so many better choices for mexican food in las vegas and henderson . very unsatisfied yours , michael local in henderson nv
0	walked in just before noon-not busy at all . 3 employees working behind the counter / kitchen . i was never acknowledged . they stared at me a few times .... blankly ! i kind of gestured to them like .... okay .... let 's get with the program . nothing , nada , zip . after 3 awkward minutes i left .
0	sign on door says open at 7am . door locked . two people at counter look up and indicate they aren 't open and not going to unlock the door to do anything . taking breakfast business elsewhere and not considering taco bell anymore in any city .
0	the steak taco came with guacamole , i asked that could be switched out for sour cream , however that would of incurred an additional charge .. the food lacked flavor , and the shrimp taco was nasty . do not order it ! honestly 9.00 for 2 tacos is high. found this place hoping for a little shop with some authenticity and left feeling rather let down. was more like a burger king meets chinese restaurant . ... in a mexican joint
0	when asked if we could sit by the windows , she rolled her eyes and pointed at the empty booths available . perhaps she should work in the back of the house instead of greeting customers . our server , christa , was very polite and professional ! she did a fantastic job and almost changed our opinion of this visit . our order was very good and very hot ! we noticed that the lunch hour hostess was training a new employee . big mistake , she needs to be retrained herself ! after coming to this restaurant for about six years , this will probably be our last visit !
0	then once you get you order ( to go ) you are given the tiniest ( about 1 / 32 cup ) of salsa . the owner , maria , says that 's all i would get with my $ 18 order . any more salsa i have to pay $ 1.25 for the same 1 / 32 cup size . ridiculous ! ! ! !
0	always dirty regardless of time of day , slow service with mostly dirty looking employees with poor attitudes and manners ! the food is always below the quality standards all other chipotle locations maintain . i just hope at some point corporate chipotle takes back this franchise from the inept owner / management because it 's a disgrace !
0	something has changed in the past few years and this weekends visit is most likely my last . the service has slipped considerably . i work in a kitchen & understand being busy , but the server openly sneered at us when we asked for my son 's water refill ( for the 4th time ! ) other servers and the host outright ignored us . this is a systemic failure , this isn 't one person or one day , they have been getting worse for years and it 's finally broken me . it 's a shame because this is where we 'd normally bring our out of town guests . i 'll be checking yelp for their replacement .
0	i 've been to many different taco bells and they all seemed decent . good service and good food . this one in the laveen area has to be the worst . why ? bad , rude employees who have the worst attitude ever . a young hispanic chick who was is her 20 's had the guts to roll her eyes at me when i asked for extra sauce . geez how hard is it to get more sauce . it 's not like i 'm asking for gold here .
0	i was the only client and the clerk was extremely short . the burrito was bland at best and a basic side such as lettuce and tomato was extra expense . i do not recommend el burro , you might as well go to taco bell ... its cheaper
0	however world headquarters returned my email with a call , and gave me the list of shops in arizona this man owns . i will be avoiding them going forward .. 1106 n gilbert mesa 1221 s gilbert mesa 3550 esouthern 6140 w chandler blvd 1900 w chandler 1561 n cooper rd gilbert 876 mcqueen gilbert
0	with all of the great mexican restaurants in town , not sure why anyone would ever go here .
0	the carne asada is a tad bit too salty and the portion of the carne asada nachos were small and the cheese was limited . wasn 't too fond of this place at all .
0	the salsa was terrible , the food all around was horrible !
0	this one is by far the worst . they give you as little as possible . the workers are stingy with the food like it is coming out of their paycheck . if you ask for extra anything they will ignore you . if i am paying $ 10 for a bowl i expect a decent size serving . the line is always out the door because they are very slow and out of product all the time . drive the extra mileage to go to a better chipotle across town because you will get better service and food .
0	didn 't realize you needed to have a reservation . hostess offered the bar which is full menu . found 2 seats together which the counter had not been bussed yet . sat for 5 minutes while the bartender who seemed to be pissed off about something did not say hi or acknowledge us . so off to bonito michocan we go . won 't go out of my way to go back. too bad because the food is good .
0	instead of correcting it he became loud and unprofessional . not cool ! the young lady at the register was kind and apologetic . sad he has no understanding on how he gets paid .
0	forever , the buffet was approximately 13 dollars and included unlimited mimosas or margaritas . today we visited and now it is $ 7 extra for mimosas or margaritas . i understand inflation but not extortion . we expressed our concern on their buffet now costing $ 20 . after that , we didn 't see our waiter again ! i 'm not paying that sort of money for a sunday buffet . perhaps that is why they didn 't have a wait today . on a positive note i have heard from their manager explaining their change . i appreciate the feedback and that says a lot about their business .
0	late night there is a problem . tonight was cash only . which is the 3rd time this has happened to me at this location . there is always some type of situation with the late night service . it 's unfortunate because it is located next to several communities . that 's mcdonald 's for you . not caring about service because they have you addicted . 50 % of time i am disappointed with this location .
0	you must be white to like chipotle . disgusting . rice undercooked . take " mexican grill " off of your name . i want my money back .
0	as a mexican myself this food was not good what so ever it was very disappointing i love guacamole and the guacamole was disgusting i 've been here twice and both times i was very disappointed the only thing that was good was our margaritas and that was it i don 't recommend this place at all unless they 've improved on it in the last 4 months and for a mexican to say it is not good that says a lot ! !
0	as an american that moved to toronto , i have long been searching for a good mexican place to eat ... and the search goes on .... what can i say about this place .... it tries too hard but doesn 't do the basics right .... plus no tacos ? ... maybe i 'm just spoiled by the abundance of choice south of the border ....
0	after a disastrous outing that resulted in returned food , i went back one other time for drinks , as the margaritas actually are quite good . while my girlfriend and i showed up with the place about half empty , we were comically told that there was an hour long wait to be seated , as allegedly a quarter of pittsburgh was just minutes away from showing up for their reservations all at the same time . verde is dead to me , perhaps it ought to be for you as well .
0	but i was in a geographical bind , so i thought id try again ... lol with little or no customers in the store . they give me half my order again .... i have to ask for the rest of my order .. lol its just sad . ill just drive over to streetsville from now on where it never happens . food is good , staff is nice. they just cant get things right there and dont pay attention . which means lack of management .
0	this chillis , refused to make any accommodations or serve me food because i was too much of a health risk . it 's hard enough traveling and having to worry about finding places to eat and chillis has always been a safe place , until now . i am very disappointed in the staff at this particular place and the manager didn 't even have the decency to speak to me themselves .
0	none of the original flavors are present , from the hot sauce with too much vinegar , to the chicken tacos , green chile , or even the rice . if you 're looking for old school flavors the original garcias used to serve back in the day , try : pancho 's ( so.cental ave ) or their kid 's place - some burros - the vasquez family still does it right . teepee - the duran family is still serving up their original recipes since the 60 's . try going back to your roots , it might serve you well .
0	we waited over 1 hr for our food to arrive and what was served was greasy fajitas that featured an anorexic chicken , 1 pound of uncooked peppers and kid size tortillas . i don 't mind waiting for things i love , like cock fights and running water , but i would not wait 1 minute for this slop .
0	the customer service though is a huge downfall , the owner always doesn 't smile , say hi , nothing . just rude . too bad because business won 't last long like that .
0	however , i was really disappointed . first the menu is really confusing , unlike the original they have different sizes of chips and salsa ... really ? ? ? the chips were also very stale and cold , along with the carne asada vampiro that had very little carne asada . do yourself a favor and stick to the original locations ! ! ! either go to the one on 7 th street or 7th ave it worth the drive ... do not go to this location it was really bad ! !
0	2 of us got sick by the time we got home , this place has gone down in quality by leaps and bounds over the last few months , it is dirty ,
0	most restaurants charge $ 2.50 $ 2.75 at most ! i 'm sorry this place is ridiculously over priced
0	it got good reviews , but how can you be closed on a friday night in a tourist town with your of notification is a piece of paper on the window . on a friday ? very poor . then make you sit outside without offering at least water while waiting for a cab ?
0	not authentic at all and no flavor whatsoever . my first time ever eating at this place because i was curious but i won 't be coming here again . the aguas frescas are way too sweet as well
0	we didnt even order ! we sat there for 25 minutes and didn 't even get acknowledged . 12 cars in the parkinging lot and no one was getting service ! horrible !
0	i stopped in to have a light bite and a drink . the food was good and the chayo margaritas were great but our bartender melissa was not so great . she was very dry , rude and unfriendly . i would come back but i recommend avoiding having melissa wait on you . if i could i would give it one star . service is everything in vegas so zero rating for that !
0	the beef is unseasoned and the red sauce is marinara . the staff is friendly and fast but i won 't be back due to the food .
0	unidentifiable food objects on the pizza . thank goodness it 's gone .
0	why can 't they fix this ? fast food would be a better option . it 's a shame because they are so well known .
0	ordered a carne asada burro and there was very little steak . in fact , not much of anything in the center . very disappointed in the quality of this product . will not go back to this store again .
0	we were very disappointed . this isn 't even a good fast food restaurant . i ordered soft chicken tacos . there was grease running out of them and i 'm not even sure the meat was chicken . spicy but no flavor . my husband ordered a beef enchilada and couldn 't find any beef in it ! total waste of money . would not recommend !
0	at least there would have been flavor to my meal ... the best thing about this place is the artwork on the building . do yourself a favor and hit the taco street truck on the corner for a real street taco experiance for $ 5 verse $ 13 for this epic failure of a joint .
0	portions are tiny . we ordered nachos with the chips on the side . i could practically see the bottom of plate with how little cheese was in the bowl . all 4 of us felt like we got ripped off and were still hungry after , but what can you do . go to the arboretum instead where you actually get your money 's worth .
0	no offense ashley , but you said : " the thing which they use to differentiate themselves is that they make their tortillas from dough when you order and also " bob " it ... which apparently means mixing the filling of the burrito when you order . " they do neither , at least not with me . they threw a tortilla on the warming plate , then just filled it with the same boring bland choices i get at qdoba and chipotle . the end result , the same awful , bland , boring shit . now there are three places , exactly the same and turning out the same poor quality of food .
0	don 't let the hipster vibe fool you , nor the fact that it is nestled between two competent restaurants . the flavor and quality had " chain " written all over . before ryan gosling and emma stone were in lala land , they 'd want you to forget they debuted together in gangster squad . joyride = gangster squad !
0	mexican place had really good customer service but food wasn 't all that great .
0	be careful when giving you credit our bank cards to the staff at this location .
0	we were seated in the basement and the service was pretty slow , not sure if they forgot us a few times . i ended up feeling quite sick from whatever i did intake - was not a fun experience at all . the table legs were uneven and the table surface was sticky - not a good look guys , not at all .
0	sitting at the other side of the restaurant and can hear them clear as day . horrible location
0	its just on the counter were the food gets handed over from the cooks for the to- go orders / inside . then i get home and find a piece of chicken in my country burrito which is supposed to be potatoes and eggs no meat . not going back here .
0	if i had known the wait would be this long , i would have just got to mcdonald 's
0	there was a banner over the name , with a new name casa don juan . good luck .
0	i 've had the time to leave poor reviews on multiple platforms . this is completely ridiculous . 5 : 30 on a sunday , not a busy time .
0	" i look thru the window and see at least 2 employees standing around drinking soda and shooting the bull ... gotta love it .
0	asked for a bowl with nothing but rice beans and chicken they handed me one with everything i said i didn 't want anything and they took it back and scooped out the veggies but the taste was still there and small chucks of it ...
0	( they should 've mention that will cost extra ) plus the menu didn 't list that initial guacamole will charge additionally . i thought it was a free topping : / deceptive point of sale : (
0	it was basically just warm tortillas . so disappointed . extra cheese is not a difficult order
0	i 've ordered them before and it 's just how it sounds a quesadilla is the burrito . however , this lady gave me one tortilla with melted cheese and charged me $ 3.50 extra . had i known that i would have just ordered a regular burrito and asked them to melt the cheese - since that 's what i got .
0	seriously wtf . this was at the 16st and roosevelt address but they are not listed at that address the receipt shows this place .
0	dicks . i even tried to tip them too for being so nice lol
0	waited 30 minutes for drink refills . had to ask for more chips . horrible wait staff ! off our list !
0	i threw it out after 2 bites and my lips were still tingling 10 minutes later . either the staff is incompetent or trying to piss people off . better sharwarma elsewhere .
0	overpriced ! ! this was my second bad experience . the first one was when i ordered a vegetarian meal and they gave me meat with the beans .
0	i didn 't want to argue . will not go back to this place . ps health grade 93.5
0	and just takes a bit of the chilis off. also tortilla stuck to the foil , added to the crappiness of the taco making it damn messy. would have also liked the taco grilled since the tortilla was all soggy tasting . tldr : felt like i was talking to a wall. three times to make an order. serious ? food sucks here too. do not recommend .
0	guess what i get my meal and it was chicken . this is the second time this has happened to me . apparently if you want steak for your dish you are out of luck
0	not worth it . carne asada had no flavor .
0	next time i suggest taking care of a customer and not being rude rosa .
0	shameful very long wait in drive thru . also , can 't believe they put so many chemicals in their food ( google their ingredients ! ) .
0	asked him he had a rewards program and he said no cause he don 't care about his customers
0	the full entree was about $ 11.50 . when i got the bill it was $ 10.50 ! ! the waitress never said it was $ 5.25 each taco . that 's a ridiculous price for flour tortilla , lettuce , and a few pcs of shrimp ! i won 't be back .
0	asked if they could add ketchup to my breakfast burrito and the manager said they couldn 't .. i guess that 's too big of a task to handle when i 'm the only customer there lol
0	said " yes ... $ 6 each , but you had to order 3 . " thought , " fine , i 'll have one for lunch ... " got home and opened box and there were 3 , all about the size of a snickers bar ? ... guess they specialize in seafood . disappointed
0	we asked him to talk to the manager and he then gave us the " i am the manager " line . we then went to the cvs next door and watched him give food to the people behind us ! ! never been denied business for nicely asking a question ! didn 't get the guys name but he was of middle eastern dissent . went to jack in the box and received great service . no wonder mcdonald 's is struggling , piss poor service .
0	told them i was allergic to eggs . broke out into allergies . they didn 't even offer to reimburse or asked if i was okay . lawsuit coming their way .
0	told us the server was very busy we should sit somewhere else on the patio . we agreed . server never came . we decided to try to go window instead . they opened 20 minutes late . ordered carne asada fries . they said they could do them without cheese and meat . so just fries basically . could only do hot dogs . actively tried to get us not to eat here .
0	there are times when there are two vehicles in front of me and i 've waited more than 20 minutes for my soda . then , after waiting all time , when i pull up to the window they take my money , close the window and walk deeper into the kitchen area . i want to get out of my car and announced that the drinks are right next to the window ! ! they drive me crazy .
0	called in a pick up order . jaime couldn 't understand a no cheese due to food allergy . then our shrimp dinner came without cocktail sauce .
0	a breakfast burrito ( chorizo and egg ) which looked a little grey , but tasted good . i wasn 't horribly sick ( like what happened the time before ) , but it was enough . i can 't go back . at least for a year or two until i forget . i just worry sometimes that things happen so fast in there is the quality and cleanliness always what it needs to be . i have eaten at the cactus store 100 times and sick twice is too much . still great food and a great spot , just need them to be more careful .
0	the carne asada burrito was small , dry and salty . the side order of guacamole was an embarrassment due to the miniscule size . all the prices on the menu have been changed ( higher cost ) . $ 6.99 and up for a breakfast burrito ? the 5 star reviews for similar items as i ordered are unreliable .
0	and it , kinda sorta , tastes alright . i can 't imagine why anyone would stop to eat here though ? maybe 218 adelaide just seems like too much of a hike for a proper meal .
0	great concept because really good nachos involve some prep work ! nacho daddy does not deliver ! ingredients do not taste fresh and are layered in a way that homogenized all the flavor . try not chopping everything into tiny bits . their menu offers very few divergent takes on the classic nacho supreme and what they do offer lacks imaginations .
0	) first their is this one guy with his gut hanging out his taco bell shirt ( always ) / everyone else except the girls looks literally like they are on drugs . taco bell should be an in and out affair , not regretting it since replacing your order .
0	" what a shame to have such a great location and serve the worst food imaginable . as one of the meat handlers was slicing the steak that was completely raw i joked that i haven 't had food poisoning in a while . well my wife and i barely made it home before getting sick . this place should just shut down . please take my advice and save yourself from a high priced case of the sh & @ & ! you 'd be better off eating taco bell .
0	i ordered the bowl of cheese with chips and chicken fajitas . the bowl of cheese was completely without any flavor and the chips came straight from a bag ... a cheap bag at that . the fajitas were ok with plenty of grilled veggies and sufficient chicken ... just no real flavor . service was the worst . at least my server was . i did notice that other tables in my area ( but different server ) seemed to be getting attentive service . mine just didn 't seem to give a rats ... well you get the gist .
0	i 've never been to another mcdonald 's and had this bad an experience . went back several times hoping the newer location would work the kinks out , but nope . still really bad . i give up .
0	as others have said very rude , never once has anyone been friendly in this place , and the older gal who is mgr or owner is the worst
0	while i cannot comment on the mexican food the hamburger i ordered was absolutely tasteless .. i was left wondering if it was made of beef or some other matter . i should have paid attention to the other reviews and steered clear of this place .
0	food : ass washrooms : always assy gross even their pop ... ordered a coke and it tasted like wood . wtf ?
0	it was bland , the meat was not prepared right , the salsa was ... well it wasn 't salsa . all in all a very disappointing experience and next time i am at this airport i will eat anywhere but here .
0	the portions are a joke considering the cost and once you take a bite you 're even more offended because now it 's overpriced , small , and taste wack . their food has no flavour whatsoever . guac is extra . the service is alright and they have like a salsa / hot sauce station . but other than that this place is laughable . i absolutely would not recommend . go anywhere else on the st clair strip . this place is not worth your money or effort . fair warning .
0	not even a " hello , sit anywhere " nothing . not even a hello . after we ordered the food , the lady never came back to check on us . not coming back to this place ever again .
0	they were throwing food to each other and playing around . they look at us and didn 't even care and continue playing .
0	3 shredded beef tacos with just cheese and a small soda was $ 11.33 . the shredded beef did have good flavor but the portion was ridiculous . the lady divided a half scoop of beef for 3 tacos . might be lucky to total 1 oz of meet . ridiculous portions , ridiculous price ! if you don 't add all of the add-ons , this place is a waste of your time and a waste of money . i 'll stick to the plain flavors of roberto 's for half the cost ...
0	asst manager put food back in container after someone brought it back from their table cause they want something eles gross
0	you should remove yourself from yelp . and then slit your wrists .
0	if , and thats a big if , you can get someone to wait on you , it would be an ok spot for a drink on a nice day . food is mediocre , mass produced mex , at way higher price than it deserves . i could have overlooked that , quite frankly , because its the strip in vegas , what do you expect ? but the ridiculously horrible service was inexcusable . stay away . tip- if you want good mexican food , go off strip , to lindo michoacan on desert inn road . yum .
0	a definitely didn 't expect this place to be sit down fast food with the other expensive retauarants in the area . the menu has 5 options , and it 's definitely more a bar than a restaurant , which is fine if that 's what your looking for . the food was ok .. meat was seasoned well but fake guacamole pureed and the salsa was zingy in the " i 'm going bad " way . disappointing . the place was very clean and the staff was friendly , hence the one star .
0	if you enjoy mediocre food , unattentive service and watered-down drinks ; but at ten times the price , then this is the place for you . you can get this food at taco bell . the server agreed to the comparison , admitting this place was very americanized . you can get the same stuff at your fast food place . i don 't recommend this place . what a disappointment , especially from a restaurant on the strip .
0	other people have mentioned it , so i 'll keep it short . more often than not the staff is off doing something , something that isn 't keeping it 's customers happy . the food here is noticeably worse than other sheetz i am familiar with . sloppily thrown together , often missing things ordered , and don 't even get me started on the pre-made breakfast sandwiches . awful . just get gas and a drink and dash the other direction .
0	this arepas are not that good . i ask for arepa with chiken and another with shredded beef . they told me that this was canadian arepas , could you imagen that . anyway i would not recoment this place isf you really want tipical venezuelan food . the place and the service is terrible ! ! .
0	i 've given it two chances , and every time it 's incredibly slow . it took ten minutes just to order with only two people in line ahead of me , and about the same amount of time to get my one chicken breakfast burrito . it doesn 't help the image that as i 'm typing this there is a huge line to order , and about 8 employees are all on break at the same time joking around .
0	i really really wanted to like this place as i love mexican food and the location is great . we gave them a try and the food was really bland . we never got a part of our order . we ordered the tamales that were on special and received a chicken burrito which they adamantly insisted was a tamale . they were out of corona but were nice enough to go on a beer run for us so that was appreciated . if the food had been good , i would have probably overlooked the rest .
0	been here for about 15 waiting & still haven 't gotten my food . only taking cash at the moment which sucks ! ! ! really bad service
0	however , i brought my order back to my office to find that they didn 't put in the chips .. so i think this is the last time i try to order the taco salad at wendy 's .. and probably my last time at this particular wendy 's : ( .
0	his name in the tag , ceasar s ! ! ! then he says in spanish vete a la verga , means in english go fuck your self ! ! ! how rude this guy i was about to make an scene but i just cool down . this guy needs to be fired ! ! !
0	i walked into the store a minute or two later . there were 3-4 people in line already . i take a seat and listen to every persons order come out wrong . at 4 : 28pm i asked how to cancel my order because 1 / 3 of my lunch break was wasted standing in line . at 4 : 37 , a manager told me to call 1-800-tacobell . i called and they said i 'll get my money back in 3 business days . they could literally staff this store with special needs chimpanzees and they would be more capable than the sorry excuses for employees and managers that this store has .
0	here i thought i was sitting there waiting for them to make it ...
0	it was pretty terrible . the crispy taco shells are store bought . the rice had no flavor . i would not be surprised if the " ground beef " came out of a can or something .
0	the chicken is dry and flavorless and the service is below average . i will look for a better venue next time i 'm in town .
0	the fries were good , but the meat was not ... it tasted a bit old , or as if it was microwaved . i decided to give the establishment a second try and got the chicken burrito which was less than $ 3 . not good at all either . i 'm not sure what it is about the food but it just doesn 't taste good .
0	decided to try them again and yep ... remember the lackluster flavors and friendly if not horribly disorganized service . when the waitress asked about the food , we mentioned the bad rice and she admitted that depending on who was in the kitchen changed how the food tasted . nice . btw , our waitress was sweet and helpful despite the disorganization or lack of staff ... wasn 't sure what kept them mia . don 't waste your time or money ... there are dozens of great mexican restaurants in this town .
0	it was the worst mexican i have ever had . i ordered shrimp fajitas . they brought me beef fajitas . the frozen margarita was weak with bland taste . we were with a group who spent a lot of money . my food was the last to come out and it was not what i ordered . there were no apologies . we lived in ca for 35 years and know what good mexican should be . seranos is is a chain which has bad management which shows through waiters who cannot get it right . the worst experience ever and the food i got was awful . i could not eat it !
0	as everything is in vegas the food was overpriced and the quality was extremely bad . tortillas that were brought out for fajitas were at least a week old and were very elastic . terrible !
0	i greatly disliked it . very pricy. you do get alot of food but it 's all poor quality . i had the yaki soba which tasted like the instant version you could buy at any grocery store for a buck ( the dish here i believe is 12 dollars ) a friend had ordered 2 rolls which took forever to arrive to the table. they weren 't very good either . i won 't be returning. as a matter of fact everytime me and my boyfriend pass by this restaurant he jokingly tells me " i 'm going to take you there for every special occasion " knowing very well i cringe at the thought . just keep driving people you aren 't missing much
0	not sure if it is a result of the issues they are having with the salmonella outbreak that affected 200 people in 20 states and 4 countries . food wasn 't too bad on the way down ... wish it would have stayed down , can 't say i would recommend ever going back .
0	rude service and food ended up costing me a lot more than my bill .
0	a bit pricey so i thought it would be better than aversge but not so .... ceviche appetizer was not flavorful and while chicken enchiladas were ok rice was dry and hard . its good for a drink and music but not food !
0	the table side guacamole was not made table side and delivered to the table in 2 small " dishes . " i also ordered the ceviche which was surrounded by packaged saltines . the restaurant is charging prices such as you would be paying in a gourmet strip restaurant . the margarita was strong , but did not mask the disappointing taste of the food ! ! ! . the service was good ..... the waitress could not be faulted for the poor quality of food . will never eat here again ....
0	so so so disappointed ! shrimp taco was gross and was made with uncooked tiny salad shrimp with cabbage thrown on top . chips & corn tortilla uses for a shredded beef taco were stale . cheese enchilada and southwest burrito were okay .
0	they had 2 employees working . one cashier and one cook . their computer system is so old they can 't split cash and card for the customer in front of me . we were told it would 10-13 minutes to get our food . it was nearly an hour later that we received our orders . the place was dirty , ketchup was empty , ketchup packets gone too . i 'm not returning here simply because the place was so dirty and unsanitary . horrible !
0	the place is dirty and greasy , especially the ceiling fans . i was glad they weren 't on . food : very skimpy for a mexican restaurant . ordered the # 3 and got about 2 ounces of beans . the rice tasted like dish soap . the 2 tacos were chicken and beef , tasteless to say the least . i won 't be back .
0	bathroom was disgusting . told the counter person , who went & looked , & returned w excuses for why it should look like that . yuk
0	i called and manager was very rude asking did i have my receipt i told him i just left from there . smh rude
0	i got one porc and i fish taco . both were gross . they were absolutely soggy , low quality ingredients . the tray it was served on smelled like a disgusting old dish rag .
0	never do i eat taco-bell but the one time i did the steak burrito almost killed me .
0	the food was terrible , and the service was even worse . i wouldnt recommend eating here to anyone , my dog wouldnt even eat the leftovers .
0	this year i tried to make a reservation and was told it was first come first served . well , we made the trip across town and were asked if we had a reservation ... does that make sense to anyone ? great food , but poor customer service . very unprofessional .
0	decided to try again this year . arrived at 5 : 30 to an empty restaurant and patio only to be told they had no openings and the to have the hostess take a phone call right in the middle of our discussion . so we just walked out . we will never be back . would give zero stars if i could .
0	ordered the chicken nachos which consisted of stale chips topped with a spray on cheese and guacamole that came clearly came from a tube . i 'm honestly not sure it was even guacamole . i tried to order the chorizo nachos but they were out of chorizo . for the main dish i tried to order corn tortillas for my tacos but they were out of corn tortillas ! fish tacos were literally a fish stick wrapped in a tortilla . don 't eat here .
0	seemed to come from their wrapping paper . restaurant was dirty but staff was nice . too bad the food was so awful , and mexican is my fave .
0	i won 't be heading back . go to los gemelos off of state st instead .
0	went back to take my son and his college roommates and the young manager was such a jerk ! with all the great restaurants in the strip i will never waste my time or money here again ! spoke to some friends who had the same experience from this young guy and they won 't go back either . i went across the street to reynas ! remember , it starts with just one customer , then another and soon you 're out of business because of the way you treat people .
0	do not order this ! ! i 'm still not over the upset stomach and diarrhea three days later . terrible experience . hoping it 's not e.coli related like their recent disaster ...
0	ate here twice got sick both times won 't be back they should be shut down or downgraded worst robertos ever
0	i got food poisoning from the value double cheeseburgers . literally have been throwing up paired with diarrhea for two days .. never coming here again . food quality has really gone downhill . train your workers to label food and not cross contaminate . thank you
0	do not listen to the positive reviews , you will be highly disappointed that you spent 35 dollars on food . i got the chicken tacos and my girl got the cantina tacos , the food was almost inedible but we did not feel like complaining . maybe they expected everyone who comes in around 10 to be wasted so they serve them any crap they want . who puts parmesan cheese on mexican food ? enough said . eat here at your own risk . only thing i liked was the friendly host with the glasses and vest .
0	well , at least it was priced reasonable . other than that it was nothing to write home about ... at all ! the service was very poor ( slow and kind of rude ) . the food was not really good at all . it didn 't make us sick or anything , and it did fill us , but it just wasn 't good . but hey , when you are stuck at the casino , what are you going to do ?
0	ended up throwing away all three entrees because it was terrible ! ! don 't do it , eat somewhere else
0	they wouldn 't let me use it because i didn 't have my receipt . no signs , notices , anything that this is their policy .
0	i can only say ........ don 't .... just don 't . this place reminds me of one of the crappy mexican places you find in the middle of kansas or missouri or something like that . it 's not good food .... i 'd rather go to taco bell across the street . we got tacos pastor and tostada and enchilada plate . no flavor whatsoever . no spice , no salt , stale chips , too much cinnamon in the horchata , service was fine ... food no bueno .
0	while waiting for my order , i was able to see into the food prep area . after what i saw , i will never be back . tried to communicate with them about my concerns and never heard back . the gloves are not to keep your hands clean but to keep the food clean . disgusting .
0	shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada lunch combo . taco was greasy and not much flavor . cheese enchilada was ok . at least it was hot and cheese was melted . over priced for what you get at $ 9.00 with no rice and beans . the " salsa " had little flavor and no spice , no heat at all . asked for something spicier and got something mildly spicer but very thinned tomato paste consistency . don 't understand the other positive reviews about the great salsa .
0	ate there last night ................... * * * * * * * * * * bland * * * * * * * * * * tasteless * * * * * * * * * overpriced * * * * * * * * * * don 't believe me ......... they 're waiting for you
0	started with filthy appetizer plate on table . ropa vieja came out ice cold . sent it back and was replaced with a burned tasteless plate of bland and flavorless food . i asked for manager and he came over and just stood there without asking what was wrong until i had to start the conversation . service timing was terrible as it is every time we give them another try .
0	had my usual chicken nachos and was sick for three days . still feel nauseous when i drive by .
0	the food does not taste good . the grocery store is not the cleanest place in town .
0	ridiculous prices . miniature servings . black eyes peas advertised as beans and bones in my fish taco ... great experience
0	first , it took forever to even be recognized . then the mahi mahi had no taste , the rice and beans were crunchy . they brought two sauces that still did not do it . i would not recommend wasting your time here . please find someplace in the airport to eat .
0	food came cold . sent it back . waited a long time . the salads and mini tacos were nothing great . the green chili is green enchilada sauce with something else green . very unremarkable . the drinks were avetage . check came ... we were charged doible . the waiter corrected the bill . music was loud and obnoxious . we are in our 60s . but still . we wont be returning .
0	45 minutes after i left , i threw it all up in the bathroom of a nearby store . instant food poisoning . i had zero to drink - zero !
0	ate there with a friend and we both experienced symptoms of food poisoning the next day .
0	chorizo empanadas ( 4 for $ 8 ) were bland . mahi tacos had a horrible tasting sauce on them , but the mahi was cooked nicely . caesar salad had no flavor . my dad liked the gazpacho , but the shrimp tamale was underwhelming . the bartender gave us 2 salsas ( we didn 't get to choose ) , the green 1 was horrible , but pineapple was ok . i ended up having to head to johnny mangos for $ 1 tacos . i wanted to love orale , but ended up hating it .
0	absolutely the worst mexican food i have ever had . the mystery meat in the taco salad was horrible and thankfully ( in an odd way ) the taco salad was literally a salad almost solely lettuce . however was still inedible . taco salad at $ 9.00 , so obviously as far as food goes , ( how do you screw up a simple taco salad ? ) it 's a cute restaurant . the server was great . but i will never return .
0	the food was good but as well as the service not so much when i think of fry bread again next time i will go somewhere that i feel wants me to spend my money at .
0	they need some lessons from robert irvine as the cheapest way to season food is salt and pepper ! there was no flavor on any of the caritas we had . i would not recommend this place to send your money !
0	ate there yesterday with my son and his wife first time the food was horrible dried plane no taste we told our waitress about it she didn 't even offer to replace our food our bill was $ 46 they offered us 10 % off was not happy at all we didn 't even eat all her food we showed our waitress.i message the management on facebook you can tell they read it but they did not reply so we will never eat here again you were other good mexican restaurants in akron this place just lost the list
0	the chips were not homemade . they were stingy with the guacamole on the flautas . i had to ask for a water refill twice before i got one . and they were a tad overpriced .
0	nice enough , despite the terrible service . then we found the dead bee in the food . they didn 't even apologize , just " oh . " the bill was brought to the table soon afterward without comment . $ 45 for two including bee .
0	i ordered a cadillac margarita fir $ 14.25 and it came out in a glass the size of a shot glass . then it tasted like a horrible house margarita . jack and coke was good though . then we got chips and salsa for $ 9.00 . chips had no taste and neither did the salsa . i wouldn 't bring my dog to eat here . service was nice though .
0	come here if you want something you would typically get from a street cart . the food wasn 't absolutely terrible but nowhere near good enough for a repeat visit . in addition the place was dirty .
0	and it 'd be nice if you didn 't try to kick us out as soon as we got there ( while other people are still eating ) .
0	at least kfc said they didn 't have chicken at the moment during rush hour ... churches let me order in the drive thru and i sat for almost 20 minutes for some chicken ... i 'm over them both !
0	i ordered the crunch wrap supreme once and it was so soggy and didn 't taste like anything . very bland . the last time i remember going there i got hard tacos and again absolutely no flavour . had to use hot sauce packets and even then it just tasted like their hot sauce . serves me right for going there i guess lol
0	the " fish " tacos had one little breaded fish stick ( mostly breading ) in a tortilla filled with coleslaw .
0	cleanliness should be first and foremost in any food establishment and it makes me think what is it that i don 't see especially from a kitchen standpoint .
0	pinches tacos was a huge disappointment . the carne asada had a funny taste to it . i 'm guessing it was over seasoned . and what is up with the extra .50 cent charge for carne asada ? this is the first place . shrimp , i get it . fish , of course . but for carne asada that isn 't asada ? no ... it 's not grilled , pinche tacos were disgusting . and by the way , this is a real mexican writing this review .
0	service- awful . food was okay . drinks were eh ! the hostesses were arguing about something when we walked in ... very unprofessional . ... don 't waste your time
0	atmosphere was great , food dislike , drinks dislike ( not strong enough ) ...
0	service was ok until we waited 20min to pay our bill . we were sick of waiting and had exact change so we took the bill to the bartender . the waiter had the nerve to run out and stop us until he " verified . " really ? ! now your present to your table ? then the bouncer had the nerve to tell is to get lost after we paid and tipped ? terrible way to ensure customers return . i and two others will not be returning and will discourage others of going .
0	atmosphere was nice but they did not have enough staff to service customers even on a wednesday night .
0	they forgot part of the order and the seafood we ordered was very fishy tasting , like it wasn 't fresh . i would skip this place .
0	menu delightful but whoever wrote it must have been out of town sunday night . nothing matched the description . worst was the paella which was pretty close to uncle bens with some chunks of chicken on top .
0	but the taco shells were soggy and broken , the beef was dry and bland ; ditto for pork . the fish was mediocre at best , and though is probably more authentic than food court fare , i can 't honestly say it tasted much better . the very so-so food coupled with bad service ( one of the staff practically showed me the door ) nailed it for me . i say : save your $ 3 , there 's so many other great taco options elsewhere .
0	was there twice and perhaps never again . it 's enough to say , that after 45 min of waiting ( and starving ) we finally asked the server politely , " hey , where is our food ? , " to which he nonchalantly replied that he totally forgot about the order . oh , did i mention that it 's overpriced as well ?
0	the worst restaurant we 've been to in the past year . i ordered enchiladas . they were cold in the middle . they actually reheated old enchiladas and served them to me . disgusting . my girlfriend ordered a quesadilla and got a tasteless cheese crisp . never coming near this place again .
0	not the first time i have called and got no answer . food is good service sucks !
0	i found a cockroach in my burrito . i confronted the manger and he blew it off like it was nothing , he was extremely unprofessional about it and made it seem like it was not a big deal . when we walked out they were laughing in our faces and said " it was only one bug .. " absolutely disgusted and extremely dissapointed . i do not recommend this place . so gross .
0	pls stay away . i just bought a burrito in the the couple hours into the day started throwing up there are better mexican restaurants around the valley do not waste your money at these crappy ass fake mexican food joint . the cooks behind the counters probably don 't give a shit and they 'll serve whatever they probably don 't even give a shit about proper food handling stay away from these places trust me
0	this place is a bar . do not go here for mexican style food ... go here for beer , margaritas , and tequila ... maybe the nachos ? ? ? only saw them--neighboring table ordered them . we should have gone to the yard house . their menu is dishonest and embarrassing . if you want real and authentic ( or americanized but delicious ) mexican food-go to los dos molinas , america 's taco shop , macayos , aunt chiladas , la paloma ... anywhere but here . phoenix / glendale-we have sooo many places ... yelp that shit--wish i had
0	at the drive thru i was told to hold on one minute ....... after 10 minutes ( and a whole bunch of mad people behind me ) i asked if they were ready yet .... " well actually , we are out of chicken .... it 'll be another 10 minutes or so ..... " wow , kfc is out of chicken .... i 'm going to see if taco bell is out of tacos .... i live close and this is on my way from work ..... but i won 't be coming back .
0	i am from henderson and we have many choices near our office . it is clear that this place has no idea what real food is , well at least not good food . i am sure that the location is the only thing that keeps this place open . i have had better food from a hospital . really its that bad i am glad i don 't have to endure this everyday .
0	that doesn 't mean brown week-old lettuce . the food quality was awful . and " fresh guacamole " ? i don 't think so . dreadful .
0	i can tell you that i 'm not surprised the food wasn 't that great . there was even a lineup too likely because the competitor down yonge street hadn 't opened yet . i had the chicken burrito which took quite some time even though there were more than 5 staff working behind the counter . all of them looked confused and unsure of their duties . my suggestion is either grab a hot dog just outside at finch station or make the extra trek down to burrito boyz a few blocks away . if i could give 0 stars i would .
0	they don 't scrape / clean grill and cook chicken on black surface .
0	i also received a mushy fish taco on a refrigerator-cold tortilla with sweet cole slaw ( but with wilty iceberg lettuce ) on it . the salsa they gave me leaked all over the bag / food / my car / pants / some mail . i threw out half the taco because it was so soggy i couldn 't eat it . surprisingly , i had only a little indigestion after the nausea subsided . there is plenty of 24 hour dining in this town ; i will not be back .
0	if you know you are going to be busy , please schedule more employees . been in line for 10 minutes .
0	if you give me bad service i won 't come back . to me good customer service is # 1 key to keep your customer 's to come back . will i come back maybe no . i know it 's early morning but hey once you walk into your place of job and that has to deal with customers you gotta smile and make them feel welcome . unlike this lady that i said good morning and said nothing back , after getting my order i said thank you and still didn 't said anything back . you don 't have to be so salty ! ! !
0	attitude the employees have makes you lose your appetite portions are extremely tiny for the price they are charging its total ripoff and it 's this particular location never going back
0	she brings me a warm bottled water . she had given me crap because i asked for green sauce . i had came in complaining about the warm water . i asked for a manager , to tell him about my experience with aurora . the manager already went home . first off the manager should of been their . now the monkey are running the zoo . i will have to report to cooperate . so sad that people like that work with the public .
0	the entire place was lacking cleanliness , won 't go back .
0	have been struggling to get a steak knife through it and its pork ! ordered pork because its pretty hard to mess up . maybe its frozen / microwave . anyway ... rice , zero flavor . actually kinda brown like they got grease in the white rice and forgot to make spanish rice . carnitas .... zero , no flavor or spice , dry and tough like jerky . beef and chicken tacos too . everyone is unhappy . expensive dissapointment .
0	but no matter how great that is , i can 't get pass the cleanliness factor . servers with headcolds coughing and hacking on the food as they carry it out to be served -- not cool . and apparently there is a " 3-second rule " that applies here if things hit the floor : worker dropped the ice scoop and it banged across the floor several feet which caught our attention -- and it was immediately picked up , waved in the air to flick dirt / hair off of and then stuck back into the ice to fill a water pitcher that the waiter walked around filling peoples glasses with . we passed . not cool . no mas .
0	illegals galore . ice would have a field day - and should . .
0	container park is really cool & deserves a better mexican restaurant .
0	factory made chicken tamales containing rehydrated red bell pepper and corn ? woah ! not to mention the rock hard taquitos , scarce of meat . the rice was really salty too . what happened to quality control ? there are too many taco shops to count but i 'll count this place out from here on out .
0	however , a dirty and foul-smelling restroom detracted seriously . worse , sewer gas dominated the dining area . the shame of it is that both of these problems are easy to avoid , the restroom by obvious means and the sewer gas problem by making a vent to the outside so the cooking ventilator does not cause undue low pressure in the facility . or the gas problem may be solved by simply making sure the floor drain gas traps are filled with water . it 's a shame and maybe an unusual event . we 'll try it again .
0	got automatically charged 20 % tip for 5 people . drinks are nothing special and food is plain . felt like i didn 't get what i paid for . rip off !
0	i 've never had a table empty of chips n salsa in a mexican restaurant before . better food and service at roberto 's across charleston .
0	the service was just bad ! ! ! i had a margarita and after it was finished i put it at the end of the table as kind of a hint to ask if i wanted another , no go ! after 6 pass by 's from our waiter i walked to the bar to get it myself . my wife just had water and no offers to refill . after all that i talked to the manager and all i got was a " that 's not right " then the bill came and no compensation . can you say one and done ?
0	i cannot give a good rating when the menus , restaurant and restrooms are repulsive . sorry ! staff was very nice , but owners should think of replacing carpet , paint and pressure steaming the bathrooms !
0	unfortunately , teepee served up overbroiled , dry beans . a 2nd indicator is the margaritas . a drink with patron should have a bit of kick ; the bartender had a second chance to get it right - no luck . caution : very noisy . service was excellent . however , there isn 't much reason to return given neighborhood competition .
0	the beef was chippy , the shrimp and the fish were frozen and not fresh . a weed was mixed in the tong ho . also , there was no smoke exhaust ventilator in the room and it 's very smoky .
0	and so i spent the night holding hair as she lost those flour tortillias . they did offer to comp the meal but if you have an allergy that doesn 't cut it
0	yelp led us astray . it was absolutely terrible . terrible ! we had the ceviche which was ok ... then everything got progressively worse . i had the tacos- crane asada and pork . the carne asada was inedible- i literally had to keep spitting out bits of meat because they were so chewy . the pork was so dry i could barely choke it down . handmade corn tortillas didn 't help- so dry . cheese quesadilla was bland and served cold . my husband ordered the torta- terrible quality bread- most of his meat was in edible and lacking in flavor . we were hopefully but this was the worst $ 50 we have ever spent . spare yourself !
0	adding a drive thru or second order line to a tortoise paced establishment was a mistake . today it took about 15 minutes in the drive through line ( aka the minimum amount of time here ) then i got the wrong order . i go inside . order again after advising of the mistake . guess what ? i 'm in my car again to find i 've been given another wrong order . i could have made breakfast at home in less than the 30 minutes and $ 7 i spent today . could have just tore my money up since i got nothing to show for it . avoid !
0	the service was horribly slow . the draft beer machine was down , they were completely out of craft beers and do you think they even comped us a crappy bud light ? nope ! the manager was full of excuses though .
0	slowest location i 've ever seen , even when there 's no line . never going back .
0	the service line is disorganized and quite gross - mixing of utensils , dirty service , prep area , and poor temperature control - food borne illness waiting to happen . upon ordering a brisket sandwich the employee thought it was acceptable to put pieces of nothing but fat in basket to weigh as part of order . when i called him on it , he removed fat out and proceeded to do it again with the end part / trash part of brisket . people in line behind me were as astounded as i was . after that , i cancelled order and left . eat there at your own risk !
0	the food was so cold and overpriced ! ! me and a couple of friends were there tonite , we ordered duck , chorizo , al pastor tacos and a havana sandwich , everything was cold , not warm frigging cold . the bartender was nice and warm up some of the tacos . the service was ok the beers were overpriced too , the tacos had no flavor the havana sandwich was so small and it comes with no sides . i really wanted to like this place , but sadly , i wont be coming back here there are better places than serve better hot and tasty food with better prices
0	avoid . avoid . i selected herb chicken tacos only to discover that the chicken was not fully deboned . the prices are cheap ; a potential trip to a dentistry clinic not so much .
0	horrible service , rude managers who talk bad about you in spanish to everyone else thinking because your white you won 't know what they are saying ... too " busy " to fix the soda machine when your the inky people in the restaurant because they are all wanting to go on break and no one will fix it ( also talking about that in spanish ) . we used to love coming here 3 years ago and let 's just say since moving back we will never come back here .
0	the portions are incredibly small for the amount of money you pay . my wife is cuban and besides being completely unimpressed with the quality of the food , was absolutely livid at the tiny portions . we took one portion home without touching it , just to measure , and it was less than a pound of food for 14 $ . the dessert was the same ' quality ' , it was tres leches and about the size of an infants fist for 6 $ . we will actively tell people to avoid this horrible place .
0	the worst mexican food i 've ever had . i even ate there another time to give it another chance ( everyone at work raves about it ! ) and still found it disgusting . the beans are the worst that i 've ever had ( you can taste the lard ! ) .
0	i bought a $ 10 order for a family member and i wanted a glass of water with it . standard , especially for paying customers . what 's more it is the law in arizona . the clerk rudely refused . very disappointing . the bathroom smells revolting . it appears clean to the eye but there is a sound of a very unhappy vent fan . the food was indifferent . del taco was better . not like nasty but overpriced for very indifferent .
0	overpriced and bland food . the worst is that they are really really slow , the last thing you want at an airport . however it is the only place that has a proper seating service and not a fast food joint . i am not coming back . one star is only because of its existence in a terminal where there are very few options to eat
0	both times we visited this spot we received horrible service and sub-par food ... most recently we waited for over 40 minutes for our food to arrive and it when it finally showed up it was cold . when i asked to speak to the manager , he could of cared less . unfortunately , since the gilbert restaurant scene has boomed , customer service and quality have gone out the window . customers have become numbers . we will never go back to this spot and advise others to avoid if you have basic expectations of service and good food .
0	if you want to wait 20 minutes just to find your order is incorrect or to receive rude service this is the place for you .
0	only got as fsr as chips and salsa . the salsa was bland . but i was served a lovely bowl of peppers in oil . ate one and a swallowed a mouthful of horrible oil . turned out it was not olive oil but pure canola oil ... ( rape seed oil ) ... rest of the might i felt likr i had a rock in my stomach . very sick later on .
0	only one person behind the counter trying to do everything during busy lunch rush . left after being patient for 10 mins & walked across the street to jumbo empanadas .
0	why can 't i just listen to myself ? took 1 hour to get seated , brought out a burned waffle , screwed up my husband 's order , let our coffee cups go empty ( never 1 refill ) then 5 different people asked us 8 times if we were all finished , would like anything else , can i take that check even though i just brought your plate , aka get the hell out . ok , this is my last mistake . matts big breakfast i 'm gone peace out used to love you but you wrecked our relationship with your dumb hipster waiters
0	twice ! ! ! ! ! ! i buy " fresh " strawberries and two days later fucking worms . my son consumed some i am sure and i may have as well this time around . omg ! !
0	i emailed their corporate and they replied that flies are allowed in the reastruant and they can not kill them ... what ? it 's ok they are still alive and flying . it will be 1 note year until i photo the flies again .
0	coke was undrinkable , sandwich was ice cold in parts and has browns unsalted , worse mcdonalds in vegas , avoid management does not quality check
0	and we waited and waited to be served . hostess never asked if we wanted any thing to drink , she was more concerned to clean tables , after 10 minutes we left !
0	service was very slow and the food took a long time to arrive . so ... we tried again today . mia , our server and the hostess was a lovely person and she worked pretty hard to get us seated in a quiet area . we ordered a meal but once again , our food was very slow to arrive . it was ok food , not exceptional , just ok . we asked for the check and got it but then it took a very long time for it to be picked up . sadly we won 't try this establishment again .
0	0 for 5 salmon tartare-far from fresh .. almost fermented lol ( laughing out of anger ) squid ink pasta-overcook pasta / over cooked lobster hangar steak-tasted nuked wild mushrooms potato puree-salty enough to gag
0	0mg .. everything sucked ... server ... food was wrong .... bread was old ... didn 't separate checks .... took forever to get food ... wasn 't busy
0	parathas were bad service not good . masala dosa was bad tummy upset not recommended
0	boss tried to buy us dinner . sat down , no drinks after like 20 min . giant huge waitress had like 5 tables come on . this seems to be a trend line in veges on eastern .
0	how can you even consider these burgers . i get the shivers every time i think about the unfortunate time i ingested these appalling whatever they are . barf ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	$ 6.99 for a kids shrimp meal that came with 6 shrimp ! freaking rip off ! never got a refill on drinks . the location on university is a million times better . won 't be back here .
0	it wasn 't even busy yet completely invisible to the entire wait staff ! literally had to walk up to the counter and to get water for my entire table . then 30 mins later when food finally came out , not only was it cold , but completely wrong . how the hell do you forget toast . and server gives us our food as if we were burdening her . absolutely ridiculous . and when we asked to talk to a manager the only thing he was concerned with was whether we were paying separately . i don 't care how drunk or hungry you are , this is vegas . there are soooo many other places you can get food other than this dump !
0	placed an order online and they " could not find my order " when they were contacted 1.5 hours later . pathetic ! ! ! ! !
0	place has such a beautiful location , lots of potential but the whole management and crew need to be replaced . rude , disrespectful & no customer service . bathroom is disgustingggg and emoloyees wear leggings and sandals but they make a big deal about dress code ....
0	strawberry cream cake was not what i expected . the center was nothing but a syrupy texture that oozed out onto my plate . i could not eat it at all and asked the woman at the counter why it was like this . she said all their cakes are like this . if so , then i would never try the other cakes ever , unless i had some pancakes , but then again the cake 's inedible center might ruin my pancakes .
0	their happy hour ( after 9 i think ) appetizers are a good deal . had the fish and chips - mrs paul 's is probably better . chicken finger dinner was nearly as bad . 2 apps , 2 bad dinners , a soda and one drink = $ 43 - $ 50 after tip for absolute junk . the manager 's consolation was a free app coupon . left it on the table . will not be going back .
0	this has got to be the worst service in town ! been waiting at least 45 minutes for our food . our male server continually avoids our table . have had to ask for our drinks at least 3 times . i live in cave creek and will never be back here . the service has sucked since the start .
0	worst restaurant i have ever been to the lack of customer service and the way we were treated yeah no coming back ! ! rude staff dirty tables don 't waste your time !
0	never again .. dont sit a party of 5 at a booth for 4 ..... pay more money and go somewhere else !
0	the place is dirty , filthy , full of garbages . the manager doesn 't seems to care , or actually he does care about the pictures i am taking . the cashier couldn 't take our order until the person in the kitchen was back from the " toilet " ! ! ! ! ! oh well i guess this is burger king 's way to care for their customers .
0	what a terrible experience we had . i took my wife out for a friday night date . they brought her main dish without the chicken . when they brought it , it was raw . it took 5 minutes for the waitress to come to check if it was right . by them the evening was ruined . the worst experience . we 'll not go back there again . terrible , awful service , they didn 't even try to fix it . there attitude was like if they didn 't care .
0	screwed up orders , took forever to get food . cold fries . . took forever to get bill and not even that crowded - came during tribe game . won 't be back .
0	super disappointed in shake shack ... i was told how good their food was. the fries tasted like del taco fries and grilled cheese tasted like jack in the box .
0	2 small cups of lukewarm soup , 1 tuna sushimi , 2 waters and 1 seafood pasta , 1 salmon . it all had no taste !
0	100 % grease burger totally disgusting i needed the restroom immediately afterwards stick with old reliable burger king or subway
0	i didn 't give 1 star cuz bun was good and cheese and burger were pretty good , mushrooms disgusting , fries disgusting , drink not so good , price really bad like 10.00 $ not worth at all . update i changed to 1 star cuz overall pretty bad
0	it was just cheese and meat with a token drizzle of sauce on top . granted the crust itself is way too thick to be a chicago-style deep dish , the lack of sauce was just ... i don 't know . we visited from downtown toronto just to try the pizza here ( chicago is too far ) and i have to say it was a huge disappointment .
0	80 % of the restaurant is empty . party for 3 ... 10 minute wait ... seriously ? ? ? follow up after complaining to waitress . she said well that 's how long the host said , that 's how long it 's gonna take ? ! ? wtf is the attitude here ? manager comes up , he says to provide better service , we make you wait ? have to wait to flip tables cuz we just missed a rush ? ok well i still see 5 tables on the side your serving open ? cmon seriously ? service your people ! ! !
0	got a bacon slamburger and egg was totally cook . it seems that they warming up the burger in the microwave . bread was soggy on the bottom bun , and i ask the egg over easy . told my restaurant manger my experience and she offer to replace , but i declined . how would like to trust a cook who can 't cook a egg . felt bad for the servers ashley . please address with cook . ruin my late night meal experience . p.s. didn 't help see the cook smoking up front of the restaurant .
0	they lied and said it was meatball . turns out the owner herself lied about it being meatball and they tried to put regular ground beef on it . i have recently seen this place gone downhill with service for about a month now . i gave them plenty of chances to redeem themselves . now they won 't even give a refund . save yourself the headache and go somewhere else . this is the last time i order here .
0	worst chick fil a bar none , i 'm usually down to drive further to the one on power going toward queen creek but simply didn 't have the time . i absolutely won 't make that mistake again !
0	10 / 7 / 2013 this restaurant is unbelievable i go to this restaurant to order hamburgers and french fries it took 10 minutes for the waitress to come back to tell me there out of ground-beef really & offers me to order a hot dogs instead and it took 10 minutes to figure out that you don 't have any more ground meat in your establishment a hamburger place ? ? ?
0	seriously it 's not about the price but i 've had better lobster roll like the food truck ( can 't remember the name ) for the same price .
0	to add to it they charged more than what was listed on the menu ... will not be going back ... worst dining experience in the phoenix area yet ... stay away . obviously they have a lot of friends posting on here as there is no way this is worth more than 2 stars .
0	$ 10 for a frozen waffle ? $ 8. for gnarly bland oatmeal ? the food was terrible , but they do serve it 24hours a day ... service was good ... but i will not be back .
0	$ 10 for a homemade leprechaun meatballs that were actually chicken nuggets cut in half and they added bacon and cheese you get 6 of them for $ 10 this place is a rip off
0	granted , it is a solid hot dog . it 's $ 10 . i can buy two steak and egg meals in vegas for that . or lose it at the tables . still , i 'd rather lose it at the tables ... it 's a just a hot dog ! ! ! nothing special about it !
0	really unfriendly service . took a long time . not great . why do you people love this place so much ?
0	10 inch sandwiches extra meat loaded , cost me 20 bucks , not worth it .
0	they treated everyone else in the restaurant the same way . if you don 't want to make money why are you open ? !
0	10 minutes passed before we received drinks then only one out of 3 meals came out , and that one meal was wrong. then my waitress told me the manager said not to worry about my food but i feel she just messed the order up the management was very nonchalant and the place was not even packed
0	so guess we will be here a while . if backed up hope the food coming out is atleast good !
0	food sat on counter as staff disappeared and was finally served by kitchen staff after i scowled at them in the back . my med well burger was over cooked and bland . their menu describes their food as " deluxious " and " gourmazing . " i would rather the sign read " blandspensive . " wish i waited for airline food ... does that say enough ?
0	get to window we are told we don 't have the chicken legs it would be a 10 minute wait we said ok then she said no it will be 15 minutes she was rude from the start . ok we will just take different chicken pieces . done . get home missing 2 parts of our order . call assistant manager and he was rude saying if we want our money back we have to come back now at 8 : 30 at night with small children who need to go to bed otherwise to bad . worst place ever .
0	10 o 'clock pm they didn 't have any pepperoni heard four people ask for it by the time i got to order they could made pep happens all the time there sorry people don 't want all ur made up pizzas that have been sitting there all day
0	lol no kinda of experience necessary to work there .. i guess they don 't believe in customer service goes a long way ! ! " perfect example of clowns on parade " they 're just missing the 2 ton lady ! ! ! no thank you at this riff raff joint
0	sushi was decent , pizza tasted off . i 'd bet it 's a nice place in many ways , but this beer price is egregious . i will not stand for it .
0	nobody inside . good indicator to turn around . wish i would have done just that . ordered a drink and was told the other ( 1 of 2 ) ipa 's was garbage . so i had one choice ! my gf ordered a vodka soda and it was her worst . that 's hard to mess up . bar tender came back and i asked if i could order a pizza . he told me the kitchen was closed . after 10pm this place is not prepared for visitors . the employees wanted us to leave .
0	the portions were larger . the prices were lower . but these days it 's way more common to get small , often stale meals . plenty of other good vegan options in toronto at this point !
0	wile waiting for about 5 min for someone to take my order the phone rings and one of the 3or 4 girls just talking to each other in the back comes and instead of asking me if i needed help she decides to answer the phone and kept me waiting there .... will not recommend this wing stop to no one i rather tell them to go to the one on 101 spring mtn and rainbow they are the best
0	we were all disappointed in the quality and quanity of the food . i informed the waiter that i was disappointed and he was going to inform the manager.the waiter nor the manager ever came to the table to hear my compliant . if they hadn 't added the tip to the bill he would have never had received one . everyone complained about the portions and the service . i ordered a salad for my dinner and you would swear it was a child 's portion that was over priced . the group of twelve left hiungry and very dissatified . i wouldn 't recommend this restaurant to anyone , you 're better off going to the red lobster .
0	i ordered the mahi mahi sandwich . the service and the food were horrible . the fish was overcooked . it made my bread soggy . they didn 't have any paper napkins . they waitress brought out paper towels from the dispenser . they had the nerve to charge me for tartar sauce . i do not recommend this place for any of your dining options .
0	1 1 / 2 hours to get our food and you would have thought it was set in a refrigerator ..... ice cold food .... server was very unapologetic for any of it .... she was not seen for the majority of our time there .... the absolute worst experience i 've ever had at a dennys if i could do less stars i would we will never return
0	not sure if they 're gone for good , but maybe ... how disappointing .
0	followed with almost a six hour round of golf . not a marshal in site to speed up play . our group waited almost half an hour just to tee off on a par three . i 've been to this course quite a few times over the past couple of years . it is a nice layout and usually in good shape , however after today , never again . having a good round of golf is all about establishing a rhythm . you will never establish that here .
0	at around 7 : 10 pm we came to have dinner . man hostess indicates there is no empty spaces available . we left and found out half of the place was empty . my wife went back to him to tell him that half of the place is empty . good luck summer time
0	ordered a cup of coffee that never came but that i was billed for . ( server apologized for not bringing the coffee , but then still charged me . ) ordered the veggie omelette with egg whites instead got the greek scramble , because the server thought thats what i meant because my mom ordered the greek scramble ( huh ? ? ) asked for the coffee charge to be removed at the cashier 's stand , and ate the wrong meal rather then wait for the correct one to be made . don 't think we 'll be back , but they wont miss our business because there aren 't many sit-down spots in that area . nobody 's perfect .
0	went for lunch and ordered a " mixed shawarma pita .... " double meat . he started carving from the pit out front then went to the back .... and came out with a fuller looking pita . half of my meat was moist and other half were dried , hard old pieces of meat . i would never eat there again . not a good start people as you have just newly opened .
0	" this place is a tourist trap for guests of the hotel who can 't afford any of the overpriced food on the strip . oh well .
0	excited to try a new restaurant so close to the action , we did a take-out order and were very disapointed by both the portions , quality and overall taste of the food . the chicken was very bland and somewhat burned . to top off our very poor experience , service was very slow . i hope management can turn the restaurant around quickly or i 'm afraid they will not last very long in the highly competitive downtown dining scene .
0	you must be kidding me ? no value conscious food choices in entire rio hotel . no wonder it is empty . hope the place closes unless they decide to give their guests better more reasonably priced options to eat . i 'll do my part and not spend here anymore until they shape up or shut their doors .
0	for take out they didn 't even give me a fork . this place won 't last never coming back here again .
0	11 minutes in my world is not fast food , , , , went through drive thru took 4 minutes to even order then when ordered sat at window for another 8 minutes .. i was asked what i ordered i said a double stack and small fry .. the cashier called for another double stack .... they had given mine away .... the gentleman whom handed me my food knew i was upset handed me my bag and said there .... hesitant to even eat this i did ... ice cold are you sure your beef is not frozen. probably should have got a burger from circle k .
0	my wife and i walked in last night at 1030pm to find everyone more focused on closing up for the night than greeting a customer . cooks were standing on counters cleaning the air filters above the stove it looked like . not a very sanitary vision . no manager , no hostess , no servers in sight ... someone saw us from across the dining room ( had a tie on ) and completely ignored us . probably was thankful that we turned around and walked out the door . well that 's worth 1 star in my opinion .
0	fries were room temperature and very stale . sandwiches were slightly warm and sloppily put together . these people put in zero effort .
0	passed several other bbq places on my way across town to get here .
0	won 't be back . $ 43.00 rip off . food was bad and uneatable .
0	cold an dc dry chicken strips . coleslaw is not tasty canes hays the beat .
0	i ordered the works on my burger and paid for blue cheese topping . i got home and all there was on the burger was the blue cheese . i got the impression that i wasn 't entitled to condiments . i won 't be back . 5 guys has nothing to worry about .
0	my last two visits there have been very disappointing . both times eggs way undercooked , pancakes size range from silver dollar size to 8 inch but you do get three , sort of . sent the eggs back to have them cooked only to get back very cold pancakes and burnt eggs . wait staff obviously did not want to be there . judging from the managers attitude i can understand why . the place is going downhill , floors filthy , bathrooms disgusting , food quality poor , and uncaring employees , look to the managers i say .
0	we could hear alot of commotion like an argument going on in the kitchen .
0	this is one of the filthiest popeyes i have ever seen . the tables , pop dispensing area , and the floor was filthy . it made for a very uncomfrotable dining experience .
0	once i got home i realize i didn 't have all of it . after eating what i did receive i also had food poisoning until 2 a.m. i don 't think i 'll be eating there again ever .
0	they had no problems saying it was okay , but when we got there ( 15 minutes later ) , they had already given our table away to another party . and the table that we reserved had only 8 persons available . the host had the audacity to tell us that we could sit separately . we will never be back to this restautant ! you may have good product , but you never treat a customer like that !
0	the business had a sign stating it was closed as of 12 / 28 / 14 & the nearest location is concord , nc . there was some guy waiting outside who also told us the placed was closed for good .
0	they came out with two eggs sunnyside up ! told the i wanted three over easy not two , they came back with three sunny side up ! took it back again , this time i got three over easy by now the toast is cold ! it 's only breakfast . three eggs , bacon , toast , no home fries . cost $ 16 ! that 's right $ 16 . i 'm from north jersey , nyc . very expensive area breakfast never cost me that much . never go for breakfast again . we were searching a place to go every saturday morning . the server was very good , kept the coffee filled and warm
0	another server brought our food . our server checked in on us and i reported our food was cold . her retort was . " i didn 't cook it .... " really ? when asked how things were when i paid ( which was a mistake as we couldn 't eat our meal ) i said it was 30 minutes until we got our food and it was cold . the cashier said " that will be $ 20.38 . " enough to make me never visit any ihop again . save yourself some grief . try village inn down the street ...
0	i had the salmon and my wife had the caprese salad . the salmon was very small and thin , one small potato cut in half and light creamed spinach . was great for and appetizer now really a meal . my wife could not eat the salad as the dressing tasted sour so we had to return it . they did take it of bill . they had good rolls . we paid only $ 4.02 plus drinks and then went down to briggs oyster co and had our main dinner course . very pricey for the area .
0	place unclean , staff rude . would recommend against .
0	it 's absolutely disgusting . tastes unfiltered n very chlorinated . no ketchup in bottle at my table . my fries was cold , hamburger was average . i guess this was due to them beating their 14 min promo or its free . never again !
0	the steak was the toughest piece of meat i ever have had ! and mine was medium rare ! go to ellis island for their steak special for $ 8.99 . all the locals go there and so will we whenever we 're in town !
0	lousy service and bad attitude are free . for the price you get a bland burger and soggy rings . the cash staff are less than bright having to repeat my order 4 times . gave the cashier a $ 20 and a townie and she gave me $ 8 in change then argued with me that she was right . when i explained that she could have given me a $ 10 bill , her response was so ! next time i 'll just cross yonge street and go to 5 guys .
0	went after work to enjoy happy hour with co-workers and was very disppointed . when i asked the server about the pricing , ( beause the menu had no prices and the happy hour section was a little confusing ) she could of cared less . she wasn 't very friendly or had any kind of personality .
0	really ? i was so disappointed with the breakfast i had here today . ps- the coffee here is awful and so is the service . there are so many options for good food in vegas . find another spot to spend your money .
0	bartender was super nice , she showed me the happy hour food menu , so i went with the barbecue nachos with brisket . it said mini but it was still $ 8.50 .. but that 's not too bad i guess ... but when it showed up in literally a salad bowl , i told myself i won 't be back .. there is way better places to go , r & r down the road , macs speed shop ... all priced better and better portions ...
0	1 / 2 hour for my coffee ... drank that 10 mins ago i hope i get some more cheaper before sunrise
0	i had 1 lobster and 2 lbs of crawfish today and they both were a big disappointment . the meats were from dead crawfishes dead lobster . i just ate crawfishes from the boiling crab yesterday , the difference was very obvious . it was $ 1 more per lb at the boiling crab , not a big deal . i 've had hot n juicy in falls church , va . i wasn 't impressed there and unfortunately this location is no difference .
0	the people before me said they waited 20 minutes . 4 people staffing . it wasn 't a matter of understaffing so much as inefficient overly chit chatty employees . one gentlemen about lost it when he saw the barista on her phone intermittently . comedy of errors but what do you expect from las vegas ...
0	what a freaking joke . this is the worst mcdonald 's anywhere . what a waste of my time . i 'm writing this while still waiting . unbelievable . it 's a drive thru . i could have gone some place good if i had this much time to kill but they already took my money . pathetic go someplace else
0	our waiter apologized yet only because she felt she had too it was not a genuine apology , she took the piece back to the kitchen to ask the cook and or the dishwasher and they confirmed its what they use to scrub pots as if i was lying and that 's when she apologized in monotone and gave my fiancé attitude & walked away before he was done speaking rude ! ! that was the braking point for us , never going back !
0	service was great . steaks were all very undercooked and horribly bland . tasteless and chewy . some sent theirs back and they came back dry . have been there many times over the years and enjoyed it tremendously each time . this steak dinner was one of the worst dinners i 've ever had . won 't be back .
0	we waited a long time for our food and then it was cold . the steak was rare , the prime rib sandwich was cold and the shrimp and grits were room temperature . the manager came to the table to bring back the steak and did not even acknowledge the issues we reported to our waitress . there are too many restaurants in the area to waste my money on bad food . i am so disappointed .
0	when my mother-in-law came to visit i was excited to bring her here . my husband and i came for the meat loaf and the roasted chicken which we got every time we came . so tonight when we came we found out both were taken off the menu . we were so disappointed and when it was brought up to the manager his comment was " well it 's been off the menu for 6 months . " i don 't think we will ever go back !
0	called to get a piazza delivered there done delivering . how can a place that delivers be done . on top of the there 3.5 miles away . the store closer at 1.5 miles away don 't deliver here . east of chicago pizza you need too get your act together !
0	you have got to be kidding me ! i walked right out and cooked at home . plus staff is on constant rotation so good luck building a rapport with any particular server . not a good sign . inflated pricing at the horizon ridge parkway henderson location . beware !
0	they charge $ 2.50 for what must be .25 worth of beans . the food was good , service fine , but seriously . lunch should be half this price . i 'll be going to rudy 's or shanes or some other place that offers a better value and equal or better q .
0	no thanks ! don 't ask for fresh food either they won 't put out new till the old is gone .
0	paid through yelp and been fighting my refund ever since . bad experience on the roccos side and the yelp side .
0	sooo like lj silver 's at , what , $ 5.99 ? friends hummus veggie platter looked clunky and uninspired , but inexpensive during hh . the very limited menu made it difficult to satisfy anything beyond the very least adventurous dining . with the myriad , and far superior , choices in the central corridor , this place is merely convenient to ( within ) the art museum . have a $ 3.50 prickly pear lemonade and yelp other options .
0	$ 13 for a bland , large cheesesteak with 5 pieces of mushrooms that we paid extra for . $ 13 for a bland , large cheesesteak that we ordered with fries -- we got about 10 pieces for that $ 3 . absolute and utter rip off . semi-friendly cashier who seemed hell bent on rushing us through our order even though there was no one behind us . n o . n e v e r e v e r again . ever . if i could give this place zero stars and burn it down in the process , i would . it was shiteous . absolutely shiteous . am i making myself clear ? i think i am .
0	not a great experience and not worth my money .
0	why can you not get a decent meal at the las airport ? it 's not like it was free ... iced tea was icky and cloudy . where are the toppings on this pizza ? ( see photo ) btw , the only reason there is cheese on this pizza is because we paid for extra after seeing our neighbors plate of crust ... save your money and grab a pretzel ...
0	lol . $ 4 for a side pancake . listen , i 'll spend money on food but lol . this is breakfast . peace and love and good luck !
0	some white rice , 3 small patatoes , lettuce , onions , tomatoes , and some chicken . the normal toppings like hummus parsley were extra . small portions ! save your money , there is a reason they are never busy and there are much better places with bigger portions in the same area .
0	actually , they came by and kept walking . one came by just as we are about to leave ! pathetic
0	gimme a break . the cheesesteak was a sloppy mess . cheese wiz all over the place with oversized vegetables . really ? this is the first place i have been to in my whole life who has the ability to totally mess up a cheesesteak . if you 've ever been to philly and had a real cheesesteak from geno 's you would never ever try anything like this . you can go get a decent meal at olive garden for $ 14 bucks . and the sad part about it was it wasn 't the price it was just a sloppy nasty cheesesteak with nothing going for it not the meat , not the vegetables and not the roll . don 't waste your time .
0	she is tricky , the price was $ 11 and i asked her egg benedicts and she added but in my order already had eggs and i asked her cheese but changed mine to delete but she didn 't ... )
0	i arrived at 10 : 45 and checked in with the hostess . the manager who was seating people had no clue as to what he was doing . we wanted to sit together and when a couple tables would leave the manager would reseat them . i went up several times to ask about our tables and the wait always seemed to get longer . after over an hour and the resturant was full again we left . time to retrain or continue to loss customers . the manager did 't just snooze he passed out . they got one star only because the hostess where very nice .
0	14 available tables and was told she can 't seat us due to too many parties being served at the moment because of happy hour ? ? ? ? wtf if applebee 's can 't handle a happy hour then i suggest either new management or don 't have happy hour due to not being able to accommodate the high pace .
0	but everything is average and blend . perhaps they are still cater to the senior crowd . cause on a saturday morning , i would think they will try to service as many table as they can . but that was not the case , not enough server , and they are sloooooow . took 20 mins to get a simple two eggs & bacon breakfast , and the food is just plain average . absolutely not worth the price unless you are on the main strip . so save your time and money , and walk down to mto cafe just 5 mins away .
0	very overpriced for such a small burger . fries are small and soggy . first time and last time , be warned , every body !
0	place is dirty and service sucks . don 't bother , better off going to kfc .
0	i asked for it between medium and medium well , expecting a 14 oz signature steak to be at least an inch thick . it was well done like shoe leather which was obvious to all . server was pleasant and friendly but not attentive . when the meal was over , my first opportunity to comment on the steak being overlooked , he apologized and said next time say something earlier , knowing full well there will be no next time . cheeseburger was good , not great . fun atmosphere ; service mediocre ; food mediocre ; overpriced . with so many other choices at mgm , i do not recommend .
0	experienced it ( nice atmosphere ) but never again ! ! food was sub-par . given prices , expected better . pierogi meal was drowned in extremely heavy sauce . couldn 't recognize the broccoli in the dish as sauce was ridiculously thick . smoked baked beans that accompanied the porkchop meal were " doctored-up " campbell 's canned beans at best . our table even joked they had exact same color , size & appearance of campbell 's ! ! just add liquid smoke flavor , dump into serving dish & charge $ $ $ $ . gross . cocktails & beers were very good . service fair . but avoid food , too pricey & not tasty . lots of better options in the city .
0	also why does it take so long to get a drink from the bar ? ordered before the previews and didn 't get it until 30 minutes into the movie . had to ask 3 separate times . staff was rude .
0	terrible service by an employee kyle . took our order and didn 't even see him again for 30 mins . someone else ended up bringing us our meals which were taken incorrectly ... by the time we got our food after ordering about 40 mins . 2 of the 4 meals were cold like they made it and then forgot to deliver . i was never given a steak knife or asked if i needed and sauce or anything else . just left alone . when kyle came back after we were finished i asked for the check and he made 0 eye contact the entire time . all the hostess were nice though so i tipped them out
0	15-20 years ago this place was awesome i went there recently for breakfast and ordered eggs benedict and was very very disappointed the hollandaise sauce was not prepared correctly i have not been back since
0	15 minutes after i ordered , and having seen the three people who ordered after me , receiving their orders before me , i approached the counter and asked about my order . they either forgot about my order or gave it to someone else by mistake , because that 's when they started making my food . wish they would have told me about it instead of leaving me uninformed and waiting even longer , i would have just asked for a refund . wings were good , especially the korean bbq , but , i won 't be returning .
0	15 bucks for a fast food burger and fries ? it was ok but that 's way too expensive .
0	pass . the flavor was fantastic . but literally 2 sips and gone . hard to be a return customer in that market .
0	15 dollars for two people food was not good salad was old pizza was cold pizza taste weird only thing good cinnamon rolls not worth ur money
0	30 minute wait for food . food is cold , bun stale , and fries chewy. enough said
0	when half of the games are broken , it 's a bad deal . when you see only 1 technician walking around to fix one at a time , it 's very frustrating . i guess next time i should do a walk around to see if it 's worth while .
0	after waiting another 30 min after discussing the issue with the manager and still no food . wtf
0	... the kitchen service is awful in every location i 've been to ... that includes reno and fremont . i am at the tempe location for spring training ... will be my one and only visit to this location or any other location for that matter .
0	poached eggs were hard boiled . bacon was raw . cafe mary was like drinking a bottle of tobasco . grits burnt ... honestly thought i was being " punked . " would have complained , but waitress almost got in fist fight minutes earlier , so thought better . take a picture of my family and hang on wall -- that is only way we will be back .
0	i have to order from the strongsville location 3.5 miles away and they were done delivering at 2 : 30. time to break out the crayons and draw new lines on the map .
0	30min for food that was cold and overcooked . all after 2pm
0	girl at window was too busy texting to get ranch we asked for 3 times . fries were cold . will not go back if they can 't get shit right .
0	the restaurant was empty , save 3 people . the only reason i got my burger at the 15 minute mark was because i had to approch the counter and ask what was going on . it seems the burger was ready and just sitting there in the bag for a while . it would be one thing if it was busy in there , but it was dead ! i had been alternating between this place and habit burger the past few weeks , but i think i 'll just go to the habit burger on blue diamond in the future when i need a burger fix . 1 star . no mas for me .
0	15 minute wait turned into 30 minutes and the order was wrong and my flight was coming up so order here at your own risk and if you want your order right order the wrong thing
0	wait . cold breakfast not served at the same time . slow bus boys . we will be going back to george 's . church patrons feel they can park anywhere evidently because they have kids who can walk . old fryer grease left a bad taste in my brides mouth . sausage gravy portions were a joke . and to think i signed up for what ? three pancakes . diana 's , george 's or anywhere else is my suggestion .
0	we had the worst possible service ever . our server by the name of alfred was rude , unfriendly , no personality and incompetent . it was an aweful experience with him . on top of that he over charged us and not once said sorry . we will never come back here .
0	time to implode and redo this place . the bad thing ( for inexperienced travelers ) is that expedia and others give this place 3 stars .
0	so last night i was feeling adventurous . well to my demise i should have chosen a different restaurant . the service was as slow as ever . our appetizer order was never submitted . we had to ask another waiter for utensils . when we asked the person who brought our food about our appetizer , the manager brought us the cold shrimp , when we had ordered the steamed shrimp . the dinner was lack luster . i ordered the king crab 32 $ for 4 mediocre crab legs . over priced , slow , horrible service . derek was our waiter . i am sorry it may be another 15 years before i go back .
0	bk should be ashamed to serve food like this . whopper add usual cold , but the new highly touted crispy chicken .... burnt , way to salty , greasy bun ( don 't know how they did that ) tossed out after eating almost half . they were not busy .. no cars i drive thru except me , two parked cars , but i was so rushed at window , and like assays no " thank you " or anything . guess i 'm done . you 'd think someone cared , especially with all the competition near there ...
0	not enough sauce , barely any cheese or veggies . they call their 12 " a large ... everywhere else , that is a medium . i seriously recommend somewhere else for your pizza !
0	i will never go back to this expensive dump ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! horrible horrible ..... such a waste of money
0	it is $ 7 a gallon at a wholesaler ! i have been a loyal customer for years ! i love the food , but treating your customers like that over ranch dressing is down right ridiculous !
0	how about working as a team , take our order and take it up with so said waitress later . gave up and went elsewhere
0	yes , welcome to vegas . except it took over 20 minutes to make those 2 hot dogs ( there was no line , and seats available .... ) and the 3 employees clearly did not like their jobs .... the atmosphere was unfriendly ; anti-vegas . anti-fun . i 've never wanted mcdonalds so badly before this .
0	not worth it ! furr 's cafeteria or hometown buffet is actually better than this place .... really ! don 't eat here ! their " chinese food line was mostly salt ; the prime rib is tougher than the sole of my shoe . you 'd probably enjoy fastfood better in this instance .
0	the only reason i would drink more here is to drown out my desire to punch someone in the face . don 't go here unless you 're " diva-licious shopping / whorish type " who likes botox , fake faces and fucking your sons teammates husband . the only thing they have going for them is molson on tap . but unless they start serving that to me in my own personal pool - i can 't be drunk enough to ever drink here again .
0	ambience is cool , service was good , but the food is terrible and overpriced .
0	it had 9 palm size slices . took a picture with a pen to show how ridiculous . i 'll try to post . it didn 't taste bad , but it also wasn 't anything different or interesting .
0	they had me order garden salad $ 5 and chicken burger / meat only for 7.50 15 $ chicken salad even a & w offers a chicken salad at a 1 / 3 the price ...
0	ridiculous . asked for fries instead and they were tough and tasted like old oil . the waitress was very sweet though .
0	counter staff friendly . interior clean , too expensive for mediocre meal .
0	the fries were top notch . the shake was perfect . the staff were professional . the order was made quickly . the problem is that no burger , fries , shake combo should be 18.00 . in and out , five guys , and habit have better food for half the cost . this place needs to get real .
0	2 . both of us ordered potatoes crispy ; one came regular and one well done - had to send back . 3 . glass in waffle when i bit into it ! ! ! ! ! ! credited this breakfast , not the coffee , ruined our breakfast , should have credited the $ 18.00 . glass in the waffle ! at least they acknowledged that something broke in the kitchen .
0	2 ) know that all of the various gravies are to cover dry food . 3 ) feel free to order whatever you want because it all tastes the same . 4 ) while 90 % of your food will be served 3 degrees above room temperature , the bad gluey potato waste they call mashed potatoes will be scalding hot on the inside . i seriously think they use a microwave .
0	food handler took garbage away / back and started making drinks . no hand washing . picked up lime and added to cust drink . bleach ! ! 2 . eggs benedict . sauce tasted like american cheese and taters were cold . wouldn 't come back ...
0	food is overpriced . 2 . food wasn 't all that good . 3 . you do not get a lot of food for the price . 3 . my husband had a very long hair in his cold pork tacos . we will never ever go back . we were both so disgusted with the long hair that he pulled out of his mouth while chewing his measly two tacos . i ordered the blue cheese burger . it was good but for 11.00 it should come with fries and not the little skinny ones that are in a little cup for an extra 1.50 . compared to the brew kettle this place doesn 't stand a chance .
0	had a lunch and a breakfast here . food arrived before coffee and after 5 requests both times . different servers . oatmeal + sausage = 17 $ . c 'mon , now .
0	glass .. dirty 3 . no hostess for over 5 min . 4 . waiter forgot what he was doing . food ... first attempt cold . 2nd attempt warmer for some of it . salmon dried out ... old . drink . floaties ... yuck . this place just made my stomach curl . table was sticky , food crusted to it . never eating anywhere at these establishments . staff unprofessional , though they act liked i would expect from this kind of rat hole .
0	now for the negatives . how can a single cheeseburger cost $ 1 more than a double ? cheese wasn 't melted because the burgers were barely warm . the order was completely incorrect as well . i 'll be back for the fries and the fries alone . we got four burgers and fries for $ 18 . two of those burgers were two for $ 5 . this begs the question , " why would you go here over in n out ? ! "
0	that was my order . the pita was stale and burned , the meat was dry and crunchy , the onions were too strong , cheap on the tsaziki and the tomatoes were warm . i got there just before the lunch crowd , so everything should be fresh . it wasn 't . if i didn 't take it to go , i would have sent it back . one star is too good .
0	one girl had a breast hanging out of her dress , such a funny sight ! # 2 my burger wasn 't fit for dog food . it looked like a bunch of gray worms packed together , gross !
0	food tastes microwaved ... new staff and menu recommended ... terrible service ! go to jack in the box instead ... better food and don 't have to tip for terrible service ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	but we 're still waiting for the food . this is a weds afternoon at 1.30 pm . explanation : they took a phone order for 11 just after we arrived ( two of us ) . i surmised this overhearing the servers conversation - no one came to check on us or apologize or offering . so i suggest if you want to eat coca 's food , call in an order . apparently that will get you priority over customers who are actually here .
0	pass next time and hit pizza hut or other for a real extra large and better service !
0	a pizza , cheese calzone and sandwich . without asking , the waitress told us they had some " new guys " in the kitchen .. the restaurant was a quarter of the way full and 3 tables were served before us . almost walked out . i 'd hate to see it if it 's busy . the restaurant was a lot better in years past , i wondered why the parking lot was only half full on a saturday . like another comment on yelp noted , this place is in need of a deep cleaning . management needs to refocus . i won 't be back for a long time , if ever ...
0	another hour for main entree . killed my son waiting for for food .
0	if you change your menu why to you take off all the great , yummy and according to my server popular items ? 3 . seriously- because you own two other restaurants that do not serve pinot grigio ( which is one on many reasons i don 't go ) you have to take over this one and remove a popular wine . 4. you blew it - with me and other .... now it 's pomo , alma , drexel or all the other options . 5 . not all change is good
0	the second time i called i was told " i don 't have time for you " and was hung up on . 2 ) isn 't it illegal to place flyers on hotel doors ? i thought that was considered trespassing . so much for customer service . so much for obeying the law .
0	it 's a " brewing company , " but they don 't make or sell their own beer ! 2 . the guy next to me asked to order food 3 times , and still didn 't get to do so . when the staff couldn 't figure out how to change the tv channel he had enough and left . 3 . plastic wear . 4 . creamy italian dressing packet for a caesar salad with brown lettuce . 5 . the food actually came from jody maroni 's next door . 6 . darkest beer they had was fat tire . 7 . bland burger with stale bread .
0	1lady there that works at the bar needs a attitude adjustment also she do not know how to make the drinks proper and very mean rude should be fired
0	) machines were broken so we couldn 't order efficiently / quickly . 2 . ) my bbq tossed chicken strips that i specifically said to toss the sauce in with were hardly coated . 3 . ) this sheetz is a waste of my time . 4 . ) speaking of time , i waited 30 minutes .
0	don 't do it ! this place is not going to make it .
0	disappointing lunch today . my guest had lobster ravioli served cold and quite honestly lacked flavor . i opted for vegetable panini with chicken . panini was soggy and the cheese barely melted . left 90 % of it and went to mccormick and schmick 's next door to satisfy a craving .
0	2 ) nachos were so tasteless that some dog poop with some cheese would taste better .. 3 ) french fries looked wrinkled like a 75 year old man and tasted like stale mess of oil 4 ) first time after i came to the us , i found a place that managed to screw up a bloody mary cocktail which was just tomato juice and water . zipps is the worst place on mill .... all the best if you go there .
0	parking is dim and unsecure 2 . table game staff is marginally friendly 3 . hosts are non-existent on the gaming floor 4 . gm does not return phone calls from high-end players 5 . cocktail servers do not serve high-end players 6 . the overall place is " ghetto " 7 . the food is sub-par with service that is understaffed and overworked ..... guests can feel that would not recommend - certainly not for the mid-scale to upper-end player .
0	while one chef makes everything else . does that seem right ? the menu is not very diverse and confusing . it 's suppose to be a brunch place yet they don 't carry just a simple bacon and egg combo . everything is complicated and confusing ! was not flavourful or filling . small portions . i bet if there was more staff they would be doing much better . apparently on trip advisor it 's rated a top restaurant to eat at .. don 't trust it . wouldn 't ever come back here . slow service ! ! !
0	slow service 2 . wrong orders 3 . lagged long enough to where half the people finished their food and left before the other half got theirs . 4 . bad experience in general 5 . and no service with a smile .
0	marcus , an employee , refused to give me a cup of water when my mouth was burning from the wings . i could purchase a bottle of water or a cup of soda . what about putting tap water in a soda cup ? i 'm dying here ! nope , that 's going to be $ 2.10 . i 'll be going to wings over madison next time i 'm feeling like i want a chicken wings .
0	after 1 hour being on the table with no food ( we order appetizers with our meals ) and nothing . finally one salad came out and 10 min later our food . my burger was bloody . spoke with manager he comped the burger and the chips . i didn 't touch the burger disgusting . server was awesome but manager showed very little concern and was acting like he was doing us a favor . my second bad experience so i won 't be back . no wonder this place has 3 stars poorly managed .
0	my daughters order was wrong , they said they would correct it . after 20 minutes the server came back to my daughter and asked if she would like anything else on the menu because they had messed it up for a second time .
0	whatever my waitress ' is , she was rude . took 15 mins for me to get a menu and 30 mins for my friend to get a refill . her service was horrible . we 'd have to stop her in passing . when i placed my order , she sighed as if i was bothering her . loaded fries are good but definitely not coming back !
0	tried to eat here sunday morning ( 6 / 14 / 2015 ) at least 10 people on the clock and no one would seat us , no one even spoke to us and they weren 't busy . 3 booths were occupied . the girl behind the counter seemed more interested in filling a1 bottles and gossiping with co-workers . we stood at the front where the please wait to be seated sign was for several minutes before we decided to leave .
0	i made a reservation and stood at the front , unacknowledged for 5min . finally the bartender noticed me and came over and asked about my reservation . it was not her job . the owner eventually came over and said have a seat at the bar , ill take care of you . we sat there for 20min ! no one said anything . finally i started calling other restaurants in the area . spuntini took down my name , said 20min and meant it ! i told him what had happened across the street to which he was shocked and said , " here , we 'll take care of you ! " we were promptly seated ! coco lezzone , bad bad bad .
0	she took the sandwich , handed to an employee in the back who pulled the ham off that i 'd touched and put back it the warmer drawer , then took bacon out and put it on the sandwich . i tried to tell them to stop , that i 'd touched it and it was a food handling violation to put the meat that i 'd touched or any food that had been given to someone back in warmer to use again , the manager shrugged said something to everyone in spanish , they all laughed and handed me back the sandwich with bacon on it . wow !
0	you have to pay for parking . they say they validate parking on the front sign but don 't tell you they only validate after 5pm . so you park underground , you sit down only to have to go back to pay for your parking . after finally getting a menu , and drinks , their soft drinks were flat . no apology . nothing . we then asked to order a few different things , they didn 't have two of the items that their menu listed . service is horrible , food is mediocre at best . save your time and your money , go literally anywhere else .
0	eeeeewwwwww ! they quickly took hubby 's plate , my only mistake is i ddn 't take a photo of it . i 'll stay away from this chain forever !
0	boombozz was hit or miss depending on the wait staff and cooks . however , american taphouse had somehow rolled all of the negative 's of boombozz into one . extremely disapponted , especially because it 's within walking distance of my home . : (
0	worst food ever . might as well go eat at denny 's .
0	came after wonderland . the bar & server crew was very unprofessional . 2 girls were on break and sat beside us that worked there & were running around and yelling and screaming . so loud i could not hear my friend that sat in front of me . my food was also burnt along with my cousins . would not go back . they need to hire or retrain staff for professionalism .
0	i threw the bag away with the food beyond disgusted ! been working allday was looking forward to a nice meal very disappointed and a waste of 2 gyro fries and 2 kids meal money just burned ! .
0	-1 due to the long 20 min drive thru wait . way to go starbacks
0	1 star .. for 1 word = gross this entire place is filthy .. dusty .. sticky .. & it smells horrible
0	had valentine 's day lunch reservations and both my mom and i ordered the cobb salad . it was as small as a dinner salad with 3 small pieces of turkey in the entire salad and no candied pecans as described on the menu , dressing was also different than what was described on menu . left hungry , completely overpriced for the meal we got . waitress was nice but never came back to check on us after we received our food .
0	zero stars for food and service . food has absolutely no flavor . eggs came out dry and cold , bacon is all curled up and chewy and the potatoes didn 't have any seasoning . service started out okay but quickly dwindled . not impressed .
0	once bartender came back , i asked some questions about wing flavors was told to know what i wanted beforehand . kind of hard to do since it was my first time calling . great girst impression .
0	everything else wasnt even mediocre . they ran out of clean plates and the clean plates werent even clean . i asked my boyfriend to grab me clean plate to a slice of the driest german chocolate cake ever and there was still pieces of left over food on the plate . the hour wait to eat on a monday for lunch was a waste of time . it lacked variety and the serving area was completely , horrifying . 3 words sums it up , eh , yuck , and yucky !
0	all of their sides are awful but not having fries in a sandwich shop is just an example of a lazy business owner who didn 't want to shell out the money for a deep fryer . off to miracle mile for a real sandwich .
0	the food is good i would give a 5 to that but since the first day they opened the portions have shrinked . the ones in vancouver are waaaay better .
0	the server upfront was completely rude and didn 't not even acknowledge me . she had no problem yanking the money out of my hand and slamming my change no where near in front of me and then rudely walking away without asking if i needed anything . she made my experience very hostile , extremely unprofessional ! ! stop paying for bad service and average food .
0	for $ 25 bucks and such a limited selection of food ... this was totally disappointing . they had the same food item displayed 3 times . so what it really comes down to is something like a continental breakfast . their scrambled eggs were cold . they did have an omelette bar with 4 selections to choose from . i tried the smoked salmon and it wasn 't too shabby , but really nothing to make me jump out of my skin for . i definitely would not eat at this buffet again and i hope you don 't waste your time and money here either .
0	disgusting burger ... i got the 4 burger meal 3 of the 4 burgers did not have a pickle and the onions were not fresh the fries were not hot ---- yuk ! ! tables dirty - floors sticky - health dept needs to do an inspection
0	i love burgers and was excited to try a new place . such a disappointment , there was more condiments on the burger than actual meat . it was terrible . i would much rather go to in-n-out or five guys , plus those places are cheaper than checkers and i had coupons ! won 't be back .
0	service was terrible , she stood there talking to other guests instead of taking care of the needs of our table . the zucchini same out over fried ad tasting like fish . the bread tasted and smelled like yeast . i ordered the italian hoagie , the bread on it as well came out harder than the wood on the table and the french fries also tasted like fish . i 'm sick to my stomach after eating there . never will i go back to this dump !
0	i was gonna rate this 2 stars cause they were nice and i 'm a nice guy but nope . vegas has been waiting for a chick-fil-a but this location gmfu . stephanie got a full menu but not this location ? i 'd rather drive the extra miles for some chicken sandwiches and whatever else i want . good people tho , just didn 't satisfy my needs .
0	after being sat by the hostess outside , had to get out of my seat three times to ask for someone to wait on us . and believe me when i say the wait was not worth it . with so many fun and delicious places to try in charlotte , do yourself a favor and leave this place off your list .
0	terrible food . terrible service . there are too many good restaurants to waste your time here .
0	we came in one afternoon and they were out of every kind of beer , we ordered a burger and it was disgusting . it tasted like horrible meat and was so over-seasoned . the staff was horrible . we tried telling them how bad the food was and they did not care at all . i would never go back to this place again . do not come here ! ! !
0	the burgers that were served to our group of six people were burned to a crisp . there was literally a hard burned shell around the burgers , including a standard burger , 2 black bean veggie burgers , and 2 orders of sliders . the waiter literally admitted that the sliders are always either " burned or raw " since they are " only 2 ounces each . " we were in a big rush to get to the airport so couldn 't spend time to speak with the manager . many of us ended up leaving our food almost entirely uneaten . stay far away from this restaurant . i have no idea how they can call themselves a burger joint .
0	it reminds me of a cruise ship buffet , but at least i. a cruise ship you get decent quality food . the omelet station is about the only thing that was decent . i tried food from all stations . pizza gross , hash browns were mush , chinese fried rice totally bland and just a bunch of rice tossed around with frozen cubes of carrots . for $ 24 a person it 's a sham . we were out and about and decided to stop in ti to check it out- and have breakfast . regret going here , don 't waste your time or money here .
0	it is outdated , no wifi , rooms arent properly cleaned . we literally showered with shoes on and didnt want to sit down . we showered and checked out it isnt worth the stay at all save yourself the trouble . motel 6 would be better than here forsure !
0	worst lunch ever . i get 1 lunch out per week on fridays and managed to walk out of this place hungrier than when i arrived . we waited over 45 minutes for our food before we had to leave without eating . the manager could have cared less . just said sorry about that you don 't have to pay for your soft drinks . oh great thanks for that now i get to go back to work starving . if you can 't handle the amount of customers in your restaurant tell people about the long wait before seating them and killing their whole lunch !
0	the attitude of those kids working there is terrible ! they have no respect ! they are just disgusting ! good it 's always cold ! the meat was missing from my burger ! what a mess ! not going back to this location ever !
0	if the service was any slower i would 've gone back in time . the food was satisfactory other than the fact that it was somewhat cold . wouldn 't come back or recommend this location .
0	took forever and only to get the order wrong at the entire table . no flavor and just not good at all . i 've never disliked a pizza ever and this place shut me down . way to expensive for any meal let alone bad food . was displeased from the start to the end . it was so bad i just now decided to sign up for yelp just to make this post . i 'll take a $ 5 hot and ready before here . get bent
0	he acted as if it wasn 't his fault but ultimately admitted to the mistake and i got my money back . food was delicious but i won 't come back because of that prick . the other two guys were super cool .
0	food was undercooked , waitress was unattentive . had to take condiments from other tables . couldn 't get her attention because she was busy talking to one of the bus boys . definitely not our best ihop experience .
0	the only plus side was our busser who got us some water and apologized over and over again for the crappy service .... no wonder this place has looked so empty lately
0	other than that do not eat here . we ordered buffalo wings that had a burnt bacon taste to it . my boyfriend got a philly cheese steak that was nothing great . same with my turkey burger that had me throwing up all night and sick to my stomach for 2 days . never again !
0	i ordered the chicken and the inside was raw ! the guac was old and fries were soggy . for a 5 star hotel the quality of the food was nothing short of a disgrace ! i only hope i don 't get salmonella poisoning . frank lloyd wright would not be happy if he was still around !
0	they don 't care . i order over the phone asked for no mayo . the person on the phone read me my order back which was correct . also my receipt says no mayo but my burger was loaded with it . also they weren 't warm when we picked them up and they were really greasy . i have had habit burger in north scottsdale one other time and it was amazing . this one just sucked . i won 't be going back ..
0	order by phone was told 20 minutes i showed up early and was told it will be 10 minutes. i was fine with that knowing that i was early but then when someone walks in and places an order for two medium pizzas and was told it would be 20 minutes and gets her order before i get mine witch was just an extra large pepperoni will not get repeat customers .
0	but ... this morning i came in to order their awesome eggs michael . it comes with pancakes ( which is equivalent on their menu as a half order of pancakes for $ 7 ) i politely ask if i can substitute or even pay a little more ( even thought it 's less ) to get a plain waffles ( $ 6 ) . my waitress said no ... i argued with her about how it 's less in price bla bla bla and firmly said no . i walked ... i 'm reasonable and understanding with request but cmon ! ! ! this little experience with this lady will make me never come back and go to egg n i or egg works instead
0	# fail order , supposed to pick up at counter 5-6min later . arrive 9 min later , order still on printer , store not busy . * sad trombone sound *
0	steak quality was poor . tastes like it was frozen . avoid it . 2 . flavor of side items were bland , and over cooked . 3 . corn bread was good . 4 . service was par . 5 . spinning nearly made us sick--the food didn 't help . 6 . not worth the money . 7 . charcuterie was decent , but how can you mess up packaged cheese and meats ? 2 people , no alcohol , 1 appetizer , 2 entrees , 2 sodas = $ 93 including
0	started off with their beer sampler and we liked none of the 6 beers they had . we were shocked , i 've been drinking beer for 38 years all over the world and the only beer i don 't care for is american falstaff until i tried these . the burgers were ok i had the az trail burger it reminded me of the burgers at wendy 's when they had the pretzel buns and my wife 's burger was served to her raw . very disappointed 1st time i 've ever left a bar & grill thirsty and hungry ...
0	i would be ok with that if the pizza was good , which was not the case . it was the worst pizza ever ! like another review stated , it was tasteless .
0	took my wife there & it was the worst $ 70 i 've ever spent on a meal . waited almost an hour for a table , ordered my rib eye med well & it was rare , food was salty & the service was just ok . we will not be going back .
0	then once we ordered , it took 50 minutes to get our food . then the manager chose to embarrass my husband by announcing to our whole table that he shouldn 't have been allowed to order the way he did . he could have solved the problem by informing his waitresses how someone can order certain things instead of embarrassing us in front of our friends . very unprofessional and inappropriate . we won 't be back . that is no way to treat customers . the only saving grace was the waitress who was very professional and kind .
0	this place was an ass backwards train wreck . they run around like chickens with there heads cut off taking orders , no body can sit until your salads are ready then they say there 's your table and be seated only to witness the table had your salads sitting on it for 45 minutes . the steak was full of gristle and had no flavor . waitress suffered with tip because again there was not one ounce of organization in the place . me no never will i stop again .
0	i sat the bar and was ignored for 20 min . dirty dishes all over the bar which were shoved aside and sat during my wait . finally water came , still no server after 10 min more . i finally walked out !
0	pretty bad overall . mediocre food , slow service , & overpriced . i won 't be back .
0	staff were nice but mislead us regarding spiciness of shrimp . my son couldn 't eat them - medium spicy . also , they were super tiny , very unlike the menu photo . chicken strips were ok but canes is way better . mash potatoes were also spicy and not good . the food is taco bell quality . never again .
0	i was excited to try the ribs . the place was clean and the wait for a table of 8 was very short which surprised me for a saturday night . that was about it . i ordered a full slab of ribs with a side salad my ribs were cold and way to much bbq sauce which was good but not great . some else had a hamburger which he said the patties where very small and was not very good . the server was nice but not very attentive . i really wanted this to be a good place to eat but i won 't be back .
0	probably less that 1 / 10th pound ! ! ! if i wasn 't already at home eating this it would of been brought to the managers attention , i managed to eat 1 / 2 of it then why waste my time because all the meat was gone already , maybe this was a fluke & someone only put 1 / 3 of the meat in ? i will never go back to this location again , as a heads up to anyone take the time when you are handed your order & take a look at the burger & contents to be sure you are receiving what your paying for . i would give this restaurant 0 stars if i could .
0	ordered a $ 3.99 chili to go . small cup not even half filled . i showed employee and was told thats stardard amount . i measured chili volume as only half a cup which is only 4 oz of chili . what a rip off for a $ 3.99 chili . plus it 's a high traffic area . hard to park . i 'll stick with wendys .
0	sat at bar and ordered 2 black diamond martinis which was incredible . food subpar . ordered the chili delmonico but wasn 't expecting a baseball size one . service sucked and bartenders were overwhelmed and slow as a turtle . would not visit again . sad to call yourself a " steakhouse . " take a pass and go somewhere else .
0	you can get a better burger at jack in the box . the burgers had an after taste like burnt char ... taste like the grill and had no other flavor . best tip don 't waste your time and $ dont go there .. not that great !
0	we were seated promptly but never even had a chance to eat our food . we witnessed 2 couples get seated after us and get their orders taken before ours by the the same waiter that came to wait on us . both couples received their meals while we sat and waited for another 15 minutes before leaving . wish i could give you 0 stars !
0	i payed $ 12.99 for an awful plate ! ! ! the server argued with me said no its cold .. bad service ...
0	coffe supper strong . would come back for the food
0	when we first got in , we were told to wait 10-15mins which was fine , but then they told us they don 't have silverware we have to wait until they washed them . i mean wow really ? ! a restaurant doesn 't have enough sliver ware , that 's not quite acceptable , not enough glass ware as well . they were serving us fresh squeeze orange juice in a paper cup . food was ok , average . at the end , the cashier gave us a check that didn 't add up ! that 's a joke ! overall experience wasn 't pleasant . we are probably not going back again .
0	was super excited to go back ... that was about 3 months ago and there food was cold and not what you see in the pictures . i figured they were having an off day . so today took my brother there today and the food was cold , i got the kobe burger , the cheese was not melted and had like 4-5 mushrooms on it . i think i am over paying 15.50 for a cold burger that leaves you wanting something better ! service was friendly but the cooking was crappy ! no more chances .
0	food was mediocre and cold . they also sent 2 people to deliver the food which i 've never experience on a delivery before . a girl and guy who looked like they took their time getting here ... do yourself a favor and order from someone else these people give off bad vibes
0	fresh , filling and tasty servings . enjoyed the kebab cobb added grilled chicken ( romaine , pita chips , local feta , charred red onions & spicy peppers with the greek yogurt dressing ) avoid 11 : 30-2 : 30pm-super long lines ! will definitely come again . 5 / 14 / 16- ordered the same spicy caesar , but also tried raspberry lemonade this visit . chills , diarrhea and vomiting have been on my plate for last 12 hours . easy for cross contamination- order takers use same gloves to gather lettuces & toppings & choppers touch boards and mixing bowls . really liked this place ...
0	ordered chicken parm sandwich , got there , paid for it , got all the way back home to open a philly che steak ...... w.t.f. ? will never try the again ! ! ! ! the lady actually said to me " well if you come back i 'll put your name in my draw for a free sandwich .... " um no , never again , void my payment and refund my money bc now i still have to go back out to get something else to eat . live to far for this . horrible horrible horrible
0	2 slices of ham does not make a sub .
0	walked by like nothing took about 15mins till he came and took our order but came in a bad mood , when i asked him a question answered back very rude . i then said no thank you i dont want anything and all he did was say " fine " and walked away like nothing . hes name was willie in side az mills mall .
0	too bad we brought it home or i would have asked to talk to a manager . please train employees to keep their long hair tied or put it in a hair net this is gross . i literally paid 10 bucks for a piece of hair !
0	hanger steak which is their signature dish on their menu for umpteen years was gamey & my hubby said tasteless ! it was awful and we sent it back . does say enough ? !
0	we had a 10 minute wait , which was fine . it was very busy . once we were seated we were handed our menus . then that was it . a few more tables were cleaned and guests were seated . the guests after us were served drinks and some even got to place their food order . still we sat there . just staring at the menus . i cannot comment on food as we left after 10 minutes of being ignore . we will bever try and eat here again .
0	hamburger was good . that 's the only thing that was good . malts are on the menu but when we ordered we were advised they no longer have malts so we ordered a chocolate shake . my husband and i each took a sip and it was awful ! really horrible like something was wrong . tasted like chemicals or cleaning solution . when i went to ask for the manager the teenager behind the counter to , d me there is no manager . she said she cannot do refunds . she said the owner won 't be in until 4 : 00 . i called the owner but there was no answer .
0	never came to get us skipped over us # 3 took 35 mins to get food order ordered 3 appetizers 1 came ... # 4 got wrong food order and also didn 't get drink order correct . been to many wild wings recommend others not this one
0	the 15 minute wait to be seated was unnecessary . there were 10 empty tables when we were seated , but yet there was a line waiting to be seated . 2 . the 5 minute wait for our server to show up was way too long . 3 . the service was forgettable . 4 . the food was too expensive for the level of service we received . 5 . note to manager . hire some more servers . hire servers who know their income depends on their level of service they provide . 6 . the food was ok , but over priced for what you get . there are other bbq restaurants charging half the price , and better service .
0	by a lot . 2 ) the mixed drinks are good . but overpriced . 3 ) no one in my family of 6 enjoyed the entire experience . you can go here if you want , but there are way better places , that don 't cost an arm and a leg . this one is dead to me . oh yeah , the fish i got was bad , i spent the entire next day ( christmas day ) with the worst food poisoning i 've ever had .
0	2 ) manager took it back and told me yes chef agreed it was too salty . 3 ) they replaced the plain pasta without the clams . 4 ) the second time complained it was not my order the linguini without clams and the manager attitudes changed so unpleasant and took the dish back to replace the 3rd . 5 ) . the final bill , buddy v 's charged me two orders on linguini & clams . 6 ) . i will not go back and wont recommend on the services either .
0	2 ) the place is definitely understaffed - waiters and waitresses attend to your table twice in a usual 45 minute sitting - once to take your order and once to deliver your bill - no sense of restaurant courtesy of attending to you in between ( i.e. top off your empty glass of water , checking if you want to order anything else , renewing your coal for your hookah , etc ... ) .
0	turkey burger served partially rare -- salmonella poisoning and projectle vomiting as a result . it was also way overseasoned in all the wrong ways . 2. noisy as hell , full of douchebags . 3. hostesses and waitresses with huge fake tits pretty much exposed while wearing ridiculous high-school teen slut uniforms. so sad . the whole place is just gross . i can think of 5 other places immediately that would have better burgers . before i ate my turkey burger and got sick the other day i also tried my friend 's kobe , which was overcooked and flavorless .
0	1 ) waited 45 min for 2 beers 2 ) waited 2.5 hours for a sandwich and salad - then waited another 5 min for silverware 3 ) couldn 't see a cavs playoff game due to softball , wresting , golf and bdubs trivia taking up tvs 4 ) when food finally came out , all orders were incorrect 5 ) after all of that that there was no offer for compensation - i had to tell the waitress we weren 't paying if it were possible to give 0 stars , i would. please do yourself a favor and support the cavs elsewhere , because bdubs does not value the game or proper service during one .
0	1.wait time was 30 minutes , then we get to table , 25 more minutes till food , then the order i had was not good , had to reorder , said it would take 10 minutes but it was longer , when they bought my food i asked for a to go box , people i was with had eaten their meal ... next time i will come earlier and order different food
0	made a comment that the one dish was not very good and waiter ignored it ( didn 't even respond ) and never came back to our table . was excited to try a new place for brunch with a group of folks , but left completely disappointed . this place looked nice and quaint online . the only thing it has going is the cute patio ( minus the flies ) .
0	we had to wait a very long time to order beverages . 2 . once our order was taken , which took a about 15 minutes to see our server , we waited additional 10 for bread service . 3 . the server was short and borderline rude . 4 . or meal took nearly 25 minutes to be delivered . mind you , the restaurant was empty . 5 . the chicken marsalis was not enjoyable . the chicken breast was overcooked and very tough . i literally used a steak knife and it was still a struggle . the potatoes were from a box . of all the fabulous restaurants in las vegas , i am sad i waisted so much money in this place .
0	if your in a hurry please reconsider you restaurant choice . we sat for over 30 min just waiting to take our order . we then waited for another 30 min for our food . the manager came and spoke to us and basically called us liars . he spoke to the waitress and she gave him a story that didn 't match ours . really why would we lie . the service was terrible . the food was cold after we got it and we ate in the dark . we used our cell phones for light . we will not be going back . and unless you have a couple hours to kill and aren 't very hungry i would not recommend this place .
0	we were told 20-30 wait and waited 45 for a table while looking and seeing open tables not being used 2 . we waited 15 minutes to have someone as us what we wanted to drink 3 . we waited 1 actual hour before food was brought out ... the food here is great ( cool coffee cups too ) but this location is managed horribly and the service is awful . go anywhere else , literally anywhere .
0	told the beer was 5.00 but after we finished it was told it was 7.50 . we had to pay the difference 3 . app was served same time as food 4 . very pricey ..... after all that food was just ok
0	3 ) plates left on the table too long . 4 ) steak was bland and had no flavor , i asked for a1 . do not believe the hype . this restaurant did not live up to the reviews . i rather eat a slim jim than pay for a tasteless $ 70 steak .
0	1 / 2 the staff playing around while watching how to reload the soda machine . a kitchen full of people , why in the hell sis my order take so long ? ain 't nobody in the dinner room or the drive thru .
0	waitstaff was nice but restaurant is dirty . food either had too much salt or not enough ... ugh !
0	worst einstein 's ever . i don 't know how they do it , but they manage to screw up my order every single time . i kept going back because it 's close and convenient but i 'm done . never going back again . the incompetence at this location is baffling . 2. when someone asks for a bagel to be toasted , it should not come out as soft as it was when it went in . if you can 't toast a bagel , close your doors , you are wasting your time . people are constantly having to ask you to toast bagels again . do something different , ffs , bc what you 're doing is clearly not working .
0	worst food ever 2 . worst service ever 3 . manager is a complete asshole to his staff and to me the customer . 4 . learn some customer service - bunch of testosterone sexist pigs - and i 'm a guy writing this fyi
0	couldn 't stand eating more than 2 bites . later got a stomach ache from the two bites . 2 ) it took more than an hour to deliver to my hotel . how can they stay in business ?
0	nothing says " corporate america " like $ 2 per .25 fl ounce of water . ps : bottle of dasani - $ 1 per 10 fl ounces
0	the lousy service and way overpriced food is not worth your time .
0	fries were cold , burger with minimal flavor , barely warm , staff rude and highly inconvenienced that i asked hot fries . when i finally got my food again about a third of the way into this hamburger with no flavor i realize that they have left my bacon off . manager was apologetic but seriously , save your money go eat someplace else . in the phoenix airport gate a19 down through 27 there 's not a whole lot of choice here for food so either pick a different place besides four peaks brewery or eat at a different gate .
0	my girlfriend got the sangria and it was so watered down it was undrinkable . the pizza was baked to a crisp . very unhappy with my food will not be going back to california pizza kitchen ever again .
0	the burger was mediocre , the shake overpriced , the fries were fries . i 'll save $ 15 bucks next time and just go to in & out .
0	my husband had to find the number and call them to get our food . this is the worst mcdonald 's . we stopped here another time and it took 15 min to get thru the line and they screwed up that order too . this is absolutely the worst mcdonald 's we have ever been to-- it may very well be the worst run mcdonald 's nationwide . i 'd give 0 stars if there was an option for it .
0	really ? ? ? no shawarma joint is worth 20 mins ! ! ! ! never come here again ! ! ! ! !
0	orders after us have been taken care of , big orders have been taken care of . this lil order forgotten ... ? ? ? very bad experience . manger & a employee aruging ..
0	she apologized and said it would be up next . after watching 3 other tables get their food , 20 minutes later we had our food . the yolks in the eggs benedict were not even warm , and not at all cooked . only about 20 % of the egg white was left , and the cold yolks exploded onto everything making it inedible . the waitress noticed that it wasn 't eaten and comp 'd our coffees , which we had waited way too long to be refilled .
0	awesome service . and then they asked me what i ordered , even when theres only two other people besides me . this place sucks .
0	we didn 't order anything off the grill or anything that requires frying , just ice cream . and for every employee to ignore us the entire time we sat at the drive-thru window was a joke . we won 't be back to this location .
0	the girl on duty was more concerned with her phone call and playing music than preparing my order . did i mention the fish was frozen ? ... yes frozen wont be back again .
0	is it everyone 's first day working here ? i mean really , when you hit the bar at 10am at a buffet to calm yourself from the terrible service only to come back to a cleared table it sucks . we went to the paris buffet a few days later and were treated like royalty .
0	if you can pass this mcdonald 's and go to another one , do so . not worth your time to come here .
0	what the hell ? ! fortunately the cars behind us backed out of the line so we could bail . never again at this location .
0	i should have got a tip for waiting so long and so patiently .
0	oh and that 's after she " hit the wrong button " and our buzzer went off . this is the worst and slowest service in this hotel .
0	server didn 't want to work and it showed . other servers came around but ours stayed inside . one server came out to the middle of the patio and asked who had what as she didn 't know what food went with what tables ... sorry , this place isn 't the good egg .. we will stick with us egg and few miles down the road .
0	a party of 10 or so gets here after us and gets served before us . service is horrible .. waiter dropped bread and never checked on us again . never got our food left before airing another 20 minutes .
0	i rarely visit mcdonalds , however when i do , i just opt for the filet-o-fish . i asked for extra tartar sauce ; when i got home and opened it up , tartar sauce was everywhere ! it seemed as if it was done on purpose by a disgruntled angst-filled teen . i don 't expect top notch service from fast-food restaurants , however this was downright awful . i had no business eating that garbage anyway . lesson learned .
0	this is the worst in-n-out in the valley but it 's the closest to my house . this one needs a staff overhaul , the high school kids working here on a saturday are too busy poking each other and telling secrets and giggling about how silly the secrets are . this is a business , there 's an expected level of service to be provided . let 's try to step it up if that 's not too much to ask . i can 't believe these fast food employees are demanding $ 15.00 an hour for this nonsense .
0	12 employees on shift . one order register and one payment register attending to a line that is almost always to the door . gave them a few chances and have left each time frustrated . never again ...
0	it 's a friday night .. where is your staff ? my food was like warm by the time they finally gave it to me .
0	" 20 minute wait " took an hour. been waiting an hour and a half for our food. they ran out of half of the entrees listed on their menu. have yet to even get bread or raw oysters. servers are rude and not helpful. will never be coming back
0	it took 5-10 mins for us to get menus ( i had to ask for them ) . our drink and food order took long as well . finally , when we received our food .. it was cold . i order a hot melted sandwich and the cheese was not even melted ( still in slice form ) .... very disappointing .
0	then our server tells us it 's gonna be at least 30 min till we get our food ...... on a wednesday at 11 : 30 am . hell no . we walked out . we won 't be back ever ...... to any hash house .
0	charged us $ 35 for 1.5 pound of corned beef . what , the what what ? meat as ok , but comparable to $ 6 / pound grocery store corned beef . not a chance of return .
0	if i could give them -1 stars i would . our server was the worst ever . we ordered coffee and toast and was asked by her " -that 's all you 're not having breakfast ? we responded with yes , and a smile . oh our server was not happy at all . after 45 minutes she asked us to move and sit on the bar individual seats . we weren 't happy at all . she said there was a line and people are waiting . we agreed to leave and we looked there 's a lot of tables available and the line was no longer there . so wrong to treat people like that .
0	2162242312 couldn 't deliver a pizza or leave a voice mail guess they just lost a regular customer because they can 't deliver
0	2-19-16 just picked up this meal you tell me not enough cheese on pizza wings not enough hot n honey sauce com on now folks yall can do better than this dam stay true to the game
0	21 % auto grat on preseason games ? i 'm not sure if i 'm cool with that especially if you didn 't mention it before starting the tab and failed to mention it when the check was dropped .
0	thus was the worst i ever got and im still amazed for 21 dollars i will never eat their again mcdonalds fish sandwitch would of been better than this and alot cheaper for sure .... crap food .
0	location was not cleaned and needed to be swept , tables needed to be wiped off . overall mess ! ! ! it was a party of 4 ( 2 adults , 2 children ) , we all put our orders in at the same time , but when it came out to us it seemed to be here and there for a sides . my cuzn waited abt 20 mins for a side of spinach . i 'm not sure if it was understaffed or what was going on , but they clearly did not work as a team . all over the place ! ! ! ! will not be going back .
0	i got the cajun shrimp pasta . noodles were old and were like eating cardboard . server had bad attitude when i told him my food was not good at all . boneless chicken wings were good . that 's the only + i can give this place . thi is my second time eating here since moving to laveen . i won 't be returning . garbage food !
0	you have officially lost my business . not surprising since just about every business in your complex seems to fail .
0	... 22 mins for cold poutine fries and chicken tenders ... used to be the spot to get lunch ... not anymore
0	by that time i wasn 't going to order anything else . i gave my card the moment my wine finally did arrive . been here 40 minutes now and i just got my check back . i wouldn 't want to see how long getting food here would have taken .
0	she showed him documentation and was very cooperative . omg ! ! ! he said it was a health violation since they have an open kitchen . good thing our group has an attorney who was present who explained ada rights . this ada violation and bullying from the manager soured the night . after our attorney friend spoke up , the manager went away . no apologies , comps , etc . service got slower though . sad ! our group will most likely not return and we go out at least once a week .
0	food wasn 't good at all ! disappointed ! dont waste your time n money !
0	$ 2.49 for a cup of coffee geeeez ... i get better tasting coffee at mcdonalds for 81 cents ... ill never go back ! ! ! ! !
0	dont advertise 24 if you 're not ! long wait and overpriced delivery fee !
0	now this is the third time i 've gone and have been told it 's closed . everyday between 3am and 4am it 's closed . seriously if you 're not going to serve people for 24 hours out of the day , don 't advertise being open for them .
0	lights on drive thru , looked closed or someone not wanting to do any work . corporate website sales it 's always open . what give ?
0	the meatballs were 100 % fail . my 7 year old could have balled up some meat and left it on the dashboard to cook and it would have had the same flavor . this place is not authentic and it is simply over priced . if they had actually made some kind of impression with the food i would have not bothered with writing this . however , this was the worst ever ....... eeeeeever . i dare not allow a real italian in there to taste this can and box food . sorry but the truth is the truth . zero craftsmanship or artisan pride .
0	stay away from this place its a sucky rip off ! ! !
0	no wifi . staff basically made me feel unwanted because i only ordered coffee . was 11 : 15 and not a soul in there , but they wanted me out since lunch was coming . in a word , " rude . " fact is , the food looked and smelled good but the attitude made me want to never go back .
0	service is horrid . salad was warm . hair in cole slaw . not impressed !
0	steak is tough and cold . hummus is uninspired . gyros is held in a buffet line instead of carved as ordered . short of the steak . promised to bring more . never did . no customers . 3 kids screwing around behind counter . trash can full . dirty plates stacked up . we won 't be back any time soon . suggest you pass it up
0	on a bright note , if there is one , the manager seemed concerned about the hot pile of greasy garbage we were served . he both apologized and explained that poor quality food is very uncommon ... however according to the gal next to us , whos food was also burnt and greasy , and the hundreds of reviews on yelp and facebook that say the food is burnt and greasy ... it is apparently very common . all i know is i wish i went to mcdonalds
0	i 'll pay that if they are tasty , tender and juicy . our bill for 3 , came to almost $ 100 and ribs were dry and tasteless . ordered an appetizer of fried pickles and onion straws . actually the pickles were good , but not sure what they meant by onion straws . we had very greasy , limp , onion rings . what happened memphis ? ? ? ? you always had some of the best ribs in town ! i was soooooo disappointed ! won 't be back .
0	i doubt the food tastes good enough to forgo water to wash it down . i won 't be finding out .
0	the owners own uncle sams next door by now they should have fugues out they aren 't getting over flow they should figure out away to use part of uncle dams for burgatory on weekend nights to increase table capacity and finally have the landlord give them permanent outdoor dining . jj gumberg is too cheap to permanently make their outdoor dining area permanent . if they left this space jj could never replace them ! ! ! although the food is good a 2 hour wait is obscene i have found many replacements
0	didn 't see it until i got home . it 's untouched , and yes that 's the bottom of the box you see . " baby kale and quinoa salad : grilled chicken breast , diced apples ( where ? ) , caramelized sweet potatoes ( joke ) , shaved grana podano , dried cranberries ( nope ) , and dried candied pecans ( not a chance they 're in there ) . " i would go back this second if they weren 't closed . canyon creek should be ashamed , i 'm never going back .
0	30 min later 2 of 4 plates arrived . pancakes had funk on them , and the french toast was burned to chared blackness . 10 min later , still no more food . for his part , the waiter was very cool . looks like he is doing his best in a horrible situation worst ihop experience ever .
0	saw we were pissed so they offered free app whih was not too good so got free drinks .... slightly better can 't imagine what a friday would be like cold bread but good salad chicken with moz . -chewy not fresh at all sole with polenta- ok chic parma-good maybe yelp has turned me into a snob ? update : i started this review 2 months ago and never posted . normally i would just delete , but this was such an awful experience i 'm gonna post anyways . maybe somethings changed since then , but idk ....
0	25 mins later they bring out a " steak " that was literally a light gray thing that looked ran over haha i could 've made better food at home for sure
0	5 others have gotten theirs and left . on duty manager was nowhere to be found to even lodge a complaint . this has happened more than once here . we are done coming here .
0	20 minutes later our order comes and my burger was cold . another 20 minutes and i get my burger and it wasn 't cold but it wasn 't hot either . my wife was served a stale and cold cup of coffee . we went to chili 's at 20th st. and camelback for years and loved the place , but now we 're crossing chili 's off out list .
0	then forgets to give me the turkey sandwich . evidently it was sitting there the whole even after i asked for it at minute 15 . last time at this location . edit : huge bone or something in the kids turkey sandwich .
0	nov. 22nd if you like waiting in line this is the place . i feel sorry for the two individuals working . perhaps the owner needs to come in and help out
0	while we waited four tables of customers walked out . chicken was dry , prime rib was good , pizza was ok . don 't sit in the back of the restaurant if you want decent service . not going back there ever .
0	the building is the size of a dog house the employees work so hard but have no room in my opinion . i think they need a bigger building and two drive through . not the employees fault at all . it 's like a one lane road when you obviously need two lanesi ! ! poor ownership !
0	i had to two people ask me for my name & yet it seemed like nobody was working on my order because it was a to-go . it seems like they tend to the people who dine in instead . plus what was more irritating was that my food was ready and the girl just placed it down to go refill silverware by the drinks . & then someone who came 10 minutes after me and ordered way more than i did got their food before i did . pretty upsetting .
0	one waitress came to the same table next to us twice while ignoring thne other three that were seated before them . when i asked what the delay was all about i was told 5 people called in sick . " only 3 people were running the place . " poor management of staff and bad attitude of the ones that are there ? i am paying for ar service , i am paying for food . i realize issues come up , but this is unacceptable . the food is good if you actually get it , but not worth the attitude and the wait . go to the bisbee cafe down the street , better food nicer staff .
0	a really small and uninspired selection of low quality food . there was nothing fresh about the buffet either . salad bar consisted of one sad bowl of romaine lettuce - nothing else was fresh .
0	french fries were 100 % under done and terrible as they came out . the sandwich ... lol ! wow , is that what nc calls barbecue ? that was the single nastiest sandwich i have ever eaten . save your money and go elsewhere !
0	tried it friday , yuk , same fatty-greasy-over cooked chicken . other yelpers right , mac & cheese is play-dough like in nature . mashed potatoes & gravy in one container ? ? your mom didn 't serve it that way , so where 'd you learn it ? the only thing good was the corn on the cob ! tender juicy-excellent ! kfc may be out of your neighborhood & a little bit more $ $ , but it 's worth the drive .
0	i don 't think the menu has changed since then . that may have also been when they prepared the " fresh " vegetable boat . while the view was great , it is one that can be found in any of the upscale restaurants on mt washington . unfortunately , they couldn 't seat us for the 7 : 00 reservations that we requested . oddly , we were the only ones there at 7 : 30 . not a good sign on a friday night ...
0	$ 26 + tax for lunch with this horrible & terrible food ? my god only worth under $ 10 , my 1st time and will be last time , too
0	got here right before their lunch period . we were hungry and it was a good deal . after making my first round , i realized that this was very different from the classy , glamorous buffet that you would expect at an upscale resort . some of the food was cold and hard . we felt sick when we left . i wouldn 't say that there was something wrong with the food , but the quality was not there . the only saving grace was the mini flan they had for dessert . it would be an understatement to say that i was disappointed . not a place where you would come back for " more . "
0	we used a buy one get one free coupon we got during check in . we went for dinner . mexican station didn 't look fresh . . pizza want good . pasta wasn 't good either . turkey was decent but the gravy was really salty . save your money . .
0	$ 27 for a burger , drink , and 2 fries , ( one was chilli cheese ) mmmm it just tasted " alright " just like every other fast food burger. ill pass next time and hit the dollar menu at burger king lol i get the same satisfaction ; p
0	jip . i can make life this under 5 $ . also they try to sell you water and hide the free water jugs until you ask for it like a beggar .
0	after waiting in line , for less than denny 's quality , we left shaking our heads and feeling terribly ripped off ! horrible . do not , i repeat , not go to this . not a single thing was good . extremely limited selections . downright terrible . caesars , you should be ashamed .
0	first impression , the chairs were stained really bad . i ordered a ceasar salad , it had hair in it . the presentation was was not attractive , brought me a " fresh " salad , all they did was take the lettuce out that had the hair on it ! gross ! ! my husbands salad was warm , almost hot and looked just as unattractive ! service was slow , waiter was not excited about the food or the fact he had to work . will not be returning ! ! i am very surprised this place is still open . had a friend go there recently who said it smelled like dead rats in there and they ran out of the place .
0	you just gave me the perfect excuse to save my wallet and my waistline ! ! ! ............. or maybe i 'll go to basha 's for $ 1.20 for just as good a bagel & down home smile & friendly service
0	the food looked so bad , i didn 't even attempt it .
0	$ 28 for an 8oz charred steak ordered medium brought out well done , zero sauce option.one forgetful server trying to take care of the whole dining room , not the place you want to go for a steak but the fries were good .
0	manager looks like she is trying to do it all and worst part is they are not telling people in line how long wait is !
0	that 's great that they have soup available but maybe that should have been a red flag . the excuse that they make everything fresh doesn 't work for me because it doesn 't take 28 mins to make a chicken souvlaki platter . lunch started off good but didn 't end well . please remove the word " express " from your signage .
0	don 't waste your time with this one . the service was good , but the food is just sub-par . lots of potatoes , pasta , and bread . everything tastes like it was microwaved in a plastic bag . the crab was pre-cut , which makes it very hard to eat , and dried out . the only saving grace was that this meal was put on the company card .
0	asked hostess if kids could finish their milkshakes there , we were going to eat and drink . they said no ... so we left . went 2 blocks down to smokin joes . we were welcomed with open arms . fatheads loss . will never go back
0	it 's not a good burger , very dry and tasteless . average buns . takes a long time to get your food . the bacon was overlooked no taste and broke into crumbs . very disappointed . also very surprised how many people gave it 4 and 5 stars .
0	hair in my turkey gyro 2 . a year later , no turkey in my turkey gryo its a shame the food is tasty but after these 2 bad experiences i won 't be spending my lunch here anymore !
0	3rd one saved the day . ordered the chicken quesadillas and it took about 25 minutes for them to come . not a bad place if you just want to drink and not eat .
0	treated the barbacks like absolute garbage . they would intentionally break glasses on the floor and make the barebacks clean it up and talk crap to them . hope these 2 get fired . absolutely dispicable . would love to raise hell with ownership about this .
0	not too difficult , right ? wrong ! ! received : 1 / 2 lb burger ( no grill marks or taste ) which looked like those frozen , robot formed burgers you see in the grocery store . bland ! ! a salad dressing sized cup of what they call great chili . not ! ! oh , and ( 2 ) raw red onion rings on a giant , non-toasted bun . bland ! ! not so great customer service . the counter person was unsure of what a chili burger was ! ! i 'm going to in & out ! c-ya
0	this was not special food , not special service , and the drink prices weren 't on the menu . shame on that waitress ! she got a horrible tip and i don 't even care . no one should be spending $ 100 at a stupid airport . come on . but why should they care ? patrons won 't be usuals because it 's at an airport . have some decency people .
0	4th wrong order from here. really ? that 's how it works here. always wrong. thanks angie. have complained to the mgr before. he doesn 't care. neither does the company apparently
0	2 cheeseburgers and french fries and i have to pull forward and wait ? why would this mcdonald 's not be ready ? i am writing this as i wait now at 7 mins ... this must be a joke ?
0	in fact i bought the homeless man infront of the restaurant a drink and meal .. moments after a heavier set hawaiian or asian man and a heavier white woman ( both employees ) came out side and harassed and mocked another homeless man . i saw them and said something to them the man mocked me as well and got very rude with me .. point being the homeless are not the problem it is the heartless humans the have working there that need to go ! ! ! !
0	drive-thru was close so that suck .. second night 24 hr . drive-thru was open but guess what the grill was not on and it would take 15 to 20 minutes to be ready to go .. so why even be a 24 hr . drive-thru if u can 't even sell a chardbroiled burger .. burger king staff get ur act together ... to provided a service ...
0	2 days in row we where disappointed ! ! ! took 20 min to get drinks , food was cold and they never even put my wife 's order in ! never will i come back ! !
0	had reservations for breakfast- 1st day took 2.5 hours to be served burnt waffles , burnt eggs that weren 't edible ( took pics ) took another 1 / 2 to bring out new meals which were wrong . wait staff complained entire time . we walked out . one broken elevator and the other malfunctioned while on it twice . tv would not work 2nd day ( prepaid meals ) again breakfast disaster , i had to set table , retrieved our own drinks , restaurant now empty and still no food . front desk is no help . will be contacting the gm .
0	so we left and went to the one on yonge in richmond hill . do your self a favor go to a different location . system errors was one reason and the other sunday they had no hot water ? ? ? who is running this restaurant ? ? ? horrible
0	drinks loaded with ice and service is poor . over all go 10 more feet to the bar inside the chocolate cafe for a drink . unbelievable .. beware of this kiosk ! ! !
0	expensive menu that did not measure up to the cost . staff was friendly but food wise longhorn steakhouse would be a better choice . view was amazing and the decor is gorgeous but it looks like no one follows the formal dress code ... show up in a polo t shirt and you 'd blend right in with the guests
0	i commented , " so the promotion is over ? " " yup , " came the answer . ah well . guess i was done with them . as i waited , i saw their menu and noticed the promotion was still going . it took a manager to correct the deal . no apology . just , " the employees don 't know how to ring it up . " really ? the restaurant was dirty and this was mid-afternoon and the place was empty . not impressed . good thing for them i really - really - like me some sausage muffins with egg ! otherwise , absolute zero reason to come back . ever .
0	in fairness , i 've heard they chopper that ice in every morning from maine .
0	the food could be served as a tourist attraction at the bland canyon . seriously guys a few spices never hurt anyone . just because its " authentic " or " traditional " doesn 't mean its good .
0	if you like blueberry hill or even dennys don 't go here. food was so bad we left without eating anything
0	the food is not as good as eggworks and the staff is extremely disorganized . waited almost an hour as we watched multiple empty tables never being filled and then multiple two top tables being filled ahead of us even though we were in the restaurant at least 30 minutes earlier . and then finally we paid more for this meal then we have for many good dinners . this restaurant is just bad .
0	my work is only 5 minutes away from them ! spoke to an employee on the phone about the missing items ! i was told off and sworn at ! i support small local establishments but i will never ever recommend this place to anyone ever again !
0	i 'm a celiac and the wings say nothing about breading as in the photo , but they are. server wasn 't even aware that tito also was a tiquilla. horrible service . but great wings once they finally brought them out not breaded . drinks tasted watered down .
0	food was cold and manager didn 't care about the poor service
0	from when we placed the order it took one hour for our food to arrive ! ! ! ! our server was very nice , but the wait for the food was unacceptable ! ! ! brought my husband here for his birthday . never again .
0	sorry , it doesn 't matter how good the food is if you turn away more people than you serve . this place will be struggling to stay open through 2011 . mark my yelp .
0	been here 25min now smh ! ! ! well tip you won 't see from me that 's for sure . treat for treat . i hope the food is good at least . suck truck stops customer service jeeeeeez
0	good food lousy service . order was wrong again . sorry but i have to judge the book by the cover on this one .
0	if you planning come here , make sure you call before hand .
0	1st time bad experience 2nd time had another down fall . fries cold took over 20min to get a new batch . received cold again . come on only fries how hard could that have been . then when telling the manager all he could say is i could get you a new order . wow sure why not let me eat another cold batch with another 30min later . sure i am just going to site around and wait for another cold plate of fries .
0	was starving when i sat down so i ordered food and drink . drink immediately came out , but after almost an hour and a half of waiting on my food i decided to walk out without finishing my movie . am happily eating wings and drinking beer at wild wing cafe , conveniently right next door !
0	1st time was for dinner and the food was not that great . here for happy hour this time . duck fat fries are just fries with an egg on top and cold bernaise that taste like mayo with fresh herbs . the pork belly taco was too salty . the chicken liver mousse not impressive either . the only thing i enjoyed was the bread that came with the chicken liver . won 't be coming back . overpriced mediocre food . they do live up to their name ... salty food for sure .
0	i have spent the whole weekend with food poisoning ! i know it was this place as my husband and i ate everything the same that day except he didn 't eat at the diner . not sure what was happening in that kitchen but i def. won 't eat here again . staff was rude as well.when asked the waitress what they are known for / what she suggested she stated " we are known for nothing . what do you want ? " pittsburgh is a big enough food scene that i def. won 't miss this diner .not sure why i would care that they were on ddd . that doesn 't mean they are good ( or clean ) .
0	after that she didn 't ask us if we were ok or check to even see if we wanted another round . then when we were closing out , she shorted us on our change and said it was tax included . funny cause i didn 't think there was a 20 % tax on beer . place was cool but service made it shit .
0	thought maybe the first time was just an off night , and it 's the casinos only option for late night dining . staff here is extremely slow ! ! ! don 't expect to see a waiter for at least 20 minutes after being seated , and don 't expect a refill of your beverage . no matter how busy they are no one moves faster than a snails pace .
0	sorry i will not be back for a 3rd time ever again ! ! !
0	waited 45 mins for an egg white omelette while all the other meals were served . finally received the omelette after we were done with our meals . had to get a togo box for the omelette as we had plans in sedona . brought the bill with no discount or apology . had to go up to the counter and request a discount . after a discussion the omelette was taken off the bill .
0	i will not be back . good food once it came out though
0	we 're done ... it 's sad that as much as it cost to eat out that the cooks and servers don 't take more pride in what they do ... we have never had anything close to this happen to us at any of the california black bear diners that we have enjoyed over the years since they 've been open ....
0	not even our drink order . both times after 15 minutes we got up and left . funny thing is no one tried to stop us or even noticed we got up and left lol . say your self the time and dine anywhere else ! !
0	owner is has no value in his customers or customer service . i have seen him arguing with customers numerous times , and wrong most of the time .. very bad business .
0	1st visit i got a meatball sub .. the bread was very hard , and where it was sitting on the bottom it fell apart when you took a bite ! nothing special , and 2nd visit i got the 1 / 4 angus burger , well it was a horrible mistake getting that ! it was way to hot , and it was microwaved ! the cheese was overly melted , and someone of the patty was hard , like it was nuked to long ! ! i ended up throwing it away ! and it was over 7.xx for 1 burger ! ! ! ! never eating here again ! !
0	far better places with better food and service in las vegas ! we waited too long for the appetizers ... then soups / salads along with the entree showed up and we were still trying to eat appetizers ! not cool ! i ordered chicken fried steak ... had no flavor and the breading was so hard / overcooked i chipped 2 front teeth ... no joke ! !
0	it was busy , and the wait was long , which i understand . but they have either switched to " frozen " french fries or they just use frozen when they are too busy to cut up fresh potatoes . sorry , i don 't pay these prices for ore-ida . fail .
0	first experience was ok . food was ok . stood at the hostess stand and it was like bedlam getting a seat . fast forward to today ...... very long awkward wait at the hostess stand . finally got sat . gentleman asked for our drink orders and never came back . we waited for easily 15 minutes . we saw lots of activity but no productivity . lots of dirty tables with dishes as well . servers seemed more engrossed in conversation than anything . gave up and walked out . i give it 2 years .
0	ordered a bucket of grilled chicken . had to replace two breast with original recipe . got two extra biscuits . all the biscuits were undercooked . not well maintained property . dirty floor and tables . nasty bathroom . will not return .
0	last year , they had run out of some bits and pieces of the turkey dinner by 7 : 30ish , but could just about manage some turkey , this year despite the fact i had made reservations at about 8 : 30 that morning and arrive 15 mins early , we sat for 20 mins or more before our server took our order , only the have him come back 2 mins later and tell us that they had completely run out of the turkey dinners ! won 't bother next year - the blake house has guaranteed us thanksgiving dinners all weekend round and is a nicer setting anyway .
0	we waited for 10 minutes and walked out . i can only assume they were saving the table until a group of 4 came along . won 't be going back here !
0	to start we were seated at a table that was dirty . our waitress was horrible , the meatloaf dinner my friend ordered was cold . our waitress never checked back with us once we got our food . i ordered ice tea to drink but never got a refill . the place was not even that busy . good bye mimi 's there are plenty of other restaurants in las vegas . and i thought they used to bring you a basket of carrot raisin bread ? never got that either .
0	burgers are much better at mcd 's ! will never go back and do not recommend !
0	the surly older woman who i went to complain about the incorrect sandwich was unapologetic , and i had to read off of the menu the sandwich that i was expecting because what i got was the " standard . " the food was fine , definitely not worth the long wait and 50 % success rate .
0	for the money you can go to the finest restaurants with the finest service for less or around the same price !
0	2 people paid over $ 100 for horrible service and nasty food ... now i feel even more sick to my stomach : (
0	waited 7 minutes , and just left .. hire a1extra person other than 1 person doing cleaning / ice / and cashier ....
0	i ordered a sandwich , chili and fries , the sandwich was up first but wasn 't joined by the fries until 3 minutes later . i had to ask for the chili as it was omitted . took 19 minutes to get my order . tattooed arms and diamond pierced earrings ( on the boys ) while the manager stood on the counter picking her nose ... and waiting for a simple order that took entirely too long makes this place a most disgusting one to avoid . unbelievable ... and these are the people wanting $ 15 an hour ?
0	besides that ... no reason . my husband and i have been here three times . once , we were sat and then completely forgotten about for over 40 minutes so we left ( no one even brought us water ) . second time , they crossed our names out instead of another waiting couple so we waited for over an hour to be seated and were offered no apologies . once we were seated , we were forgotten about again and ended up just leaving . our third and final time , we finally were sat and able to order in a timely manor , but then no one ever came to refill our drinks or check if we needed anything . such a bummer .
0	they kept adding cheese to my burger when i kept asking for no cheese . maybe the cook has cheese instead of brain matter . but i was honestly expecting a lot better than mcdlds .
0	are you f * * ing kiding me ? awful ! ! pathetic !
0	server never stop by to check on us . liked this place before that 's why i.came back but totally disappointed today
0	bad attitude . i understand we had no reservation . his attitude when we said we didn 't have a reservation was like . how dare you show up without a reservation , quote " let me see if i can fit you in . " sorry bad manners and attitude . never go back and will not recommend . this is the second time we had a bad experience at the host stand . too many options . remodel or not you will go down with poor training and snobby attitudes from you 16 year old staff greeting at the door . worst experience in all the years eating out . that 's 2 times a week .
0	purely based on service and a less than appetizing menu that would make a person want to put up with it . i am done . thought first time was due to them just being busy , but 2nd time confirmed that they just have an opportunity around staffing and bartenders . we walked out tonight after standing / sitting at bar for 20 min without being asked for even a drink order .
0	food is poor , prices are high and not worth it . much rather go to an asian restaurant and get good fresh lobster instead of this buttery lobster tail place . shrimp was pretty bad too .
0	2 topping medium pizza 6 wings and a salad $ 35 .... what a joke ... not impressive food either .
0	2weeks ago their caniac without a drink was $ 7.89 , but today they charged $ 9.03 .. a 15 % increase .. what a ripoff to us on a fixed income .. i wish ss would give us an increase like that ... shame on u raising canes
0	do yourself a favor there are many other places to eat in the area go to any of them !
0	tonight 12-20-16 we came we got the black cook and got the same thing it was greasy garbage the oil was soaked throught my bun . i don 't know maybe he was upset because be had to remake the food idk but it sucked tonight and the fries were limp not crispy like last time . the only good thing about tonight the evening cashier is super nice with great personality we seen her both times ! thanks cashier
0	i thought it was great to have a close place with good bbq ...... until my colleague and i went for lunch recently . i had the worst night in my recent memory . my colleague also got sick . now i can 't think about pork on a fork without feeling sick .
0	this experience made it into my list of most horrible experience i 've had in my lifetime . ummm yeah never again .
0	food poison . was in town last week working the magic convention . i had dinner here the night before the big opening day . mini burgers with bacon . my friend had the turkey burger with bacon . for the next 48 hours we were in pain and to spare the details , in the restroom every hour . had to be the bacon . regardless , never again . this place is awful just like the hilton .
0	my sister and i shared the chicken and waffles . the portion of this thing was huge , so sharing it was a good idea . anyway , we both thought it tasted gross . bland chicken and crappy waffles with bacon in it . im suprised this was suppose to be one of their popular items on the menu . we only had couple of bites and we were done.this was probably the worst meal i ever had . who knew chicken and waffles would kill it for me ? !
0	and other words to add : slow wait , incorrect wait times , uncomfortably close seating . the food in unique and tasty , never had an issue until my 4-5th time here ( the wait to me was always worth it ) when i got my pancake served raw and uncooked . : ( sad to say that ( as well as birds attacking us on the patio ) may have been the finally verdict on us never returning .
0	i use to look forward coming to this place and trying their weekly menu . one day we came here and everything changed. the new chef took everything that was good about this place and replaced it with generic stuff that doesn 't make any sense . i never been back and still so bitter about the change .
0	who ever heard of ordering a $ 10.00 burger where fries are extra ? ? ? ? sorry , smokey bones , you 're losing on this one ! ! ! food and service are just not what they used to be ... and the news says we are becoming a service nation ? ..... smokey better get your act together ! ! !
0	hmmmmm . this needed to be a shining star . what we got was a burned out comet . 20 ounce rib eye looked closer to 14 ounces with the bone in . hubby and i split steak and lobster . the lobster was overlooked and our steak was barely warm . the mojito was truly awful and he mentioned it to our server who was rarely seen . no apologies offered . refill on that tea or soda ? it 's going to cost you . dessert ? i think not . save yourself the time and money . eat elsewhere .
0	the last time we went there the stuffed pizza was undercooked . we figured maybe it was just a fluke and it was undercooked because it was so huge , so this time we ordered a regular pizza not stuffed and it still was horrible . they only get one star for the nice cashier at the front .
0	not a good value . ordered omelette with pancakes . i only ate half of it . didn 't taste good . pancakes suppose to be fluffy . felt sick to my stomach afterward because it 's so expensive and tastes bad .
0	probably the worst buffet i have ever been to . i only ate 2 plates and ice cream . the next day , i weighed myself and lost a pound .
0	$ 30 for two dishes : - 8 random leafs and dressing and finger tip sized cheese - a highlighter sized squash with a single mushroom what a waste of time
0	then they tried to charge me $ 18 for a two piece meal that was $ 7.49 . then they lost my order and i had to reorder . so that girl disappeared and another one took over , and again tried to charge me $ 16 ! i ordered a third time . fortunately they have me a second drink , because they didn 't know the first girl already gave me one , and i got a free piece of pie , because i was livid ! check your orders people ! ! she said everyone was new , but apparently no one got any training yet .
0	sunday afternoon lunch at 2 : 30pm . horrible customer service , all the employees look like they have no motivation and are preoccupied with other things ( laughing and joking with each other , texting , etc . ) besides making the customer happy . horrible place to decide to stop to eat !
0	this is a serious downgrade from my last review . i think it has to do with the manager on duty . friday , nov 10 , 12 : 30am . fire her pls . they are usually decent and deliver what you need . i have no idea why it took so long when i arrived .
0	i even fainted a few times , kept going in and out of consciousnesses . and this is coming from a indian guy .
0	i suspect the order wasn 't placed until then as other patrons were seated in and served by the same waiter well after we arrived . no apology and no consideration was given . will not return .
0	this place is highly overrated if you order something in the drive-thru it 's completely different than if you order it inside to eat these people are scum bags
0	30 minutes is just too long to wait for wings and it still didn 't look like my order was coming so no thanks .
0	oh wait ( pun intended ) not even acknowledgement ! how hard is it to say hey be with you in 45 minutes ! waitress walked by 10 times . guess it was hard . anyway i 'm a local wanted to come here a bunch of times . talked my friend into then said screw it . can 't tell you about the food never got it . won 't be back .
0	worst customer service ever . on my way to atl wings and im still on hold , just want to find out how long that girl is gonna take . whatever guys never going back at that place with my family
0	guy handed me my order with a lukewarm apology but no one asked how they could make it right or offered to do anything to make it right . seriously , 15 other orders after mine were distributed while i stood there . after 6 , i started asking where mine was . won 't ever eat at one of these places again . first visit . only visit . you wasted my time and disrespected me . bye .
0	really ? this place sucks ! you can starve to death before you get your food .
0	extremely slow getting waiter to take our order and long wait for food ( told him we has tickets for the show . had to take dessert in takeout box at 6 : 50 . very noisy and okay food .
0	this is awful . manager wasn 't even present to to see how the meal was or to resolve any problem . the wait staff blamed it on a new bartender for the delay on drinks . oh and it 's the first night . also for the sushi chef ! ! ! all she could was apologize . finally we gave up and walked out . paid for what little we did get ! normally a good place . thought this diamond in the rough was a gem . turns out to just a lump of coal ! ! ! merry christmas ! ! ! not ! ! !
0	servers were not capable of following through with orders properly . management team needs to step up their game and do a better job .
0	1 hour for bread on table . 15 more mins for food . " aint nobody got time for that " the place is a mess right now . not just us but multiple tables with the hand on face bored looks and wtf is going on faces . i know it 's new but come on . i have been to new places that aren 't this messed up . hold off on this place for a few months and see if they get their act together . the food seemed ok but not that good .
0	i don 't think so . no one should wait this long at any place , specially if they are not busy . after opening our take out , we were shocked to find that the sandwiches were very simple and not very flavorful . the salads were very , very basic . i don 't understand why they had me wait so long .
0	lean yes , but only a few bites per rib . flemings bobby q is not . will not return . value of the 4 ribs and 2 average sides is closer to $ 15.99 . thank you for the well thought out reply from bobby q. if i read it correctly , the message is we charge what we get away with . until business slows , no changes will happen . i believe in the free market and people are paying it , so i cant blame them for taking advantage . but i will never go back , even if the price ever comes down to match the product .
0	i would not use this place in the future . i can get the same results at a $ 5 car wash .
0	i only has a cup of soup . horrible cheddar beer soup . the service was great . my bf had wings . very good . so why 1 * ? too spendy . the dog wouldnt eat my leftover soup .
0	i asked if i just sit anywhere and she said " uhhh , yeah " while looking at a clock . i asked if they were closed and she said at 4. thats still a half an hour. yelp says they close at 7 .
0	are you kidding me ? stay away . i will make my own juice . can 't even rank this place one star but have no choice because that 's the min ranking . brutal .
0	watched two customers get refunded whilst waiting , as their orders had been ' forgotten ' ( imagine that wait time ! ) no seating available so we walked home with our our burgers , only to find someone else 's . major bummer when you pay close to $ 30 for a couple burgers . other locations have been super reliable , and my partner loves their food . but this is my second time around and i think i will stick to something else from now one .
0	i asked a cleveland cop .... never heard of it . i searched my smartphone .... nothing . i called 411 .... nothing . this tip was a bum steer . it was pouring rain on the day we were in cleveland to see the indians . " the mistake by the lake . " yelp needs to monitor and update these .
0	no way i 'm paying 8 for a sub . that quiznos was horrible . not nice to overcharge patients from the va .....
0	lots of people behind the counter doing nothing . the sliced brisket taste like it was cooked in the oven , not a smoker . it was about 50 % fat . my mac and cheese had no taste and was not even warm , polish sausage was cold . my wife had a stuffed potato with pork which was cold as well .
0	35 minutes for terrible hash browns and horrible response from the staff the whole time ? it 's in line with other johnny rockets i 've seen before ... by that i mean it 's a really terrible facsimile of a bad diner .
0	doors locked , lights out , no cars . ( it shouldn 't be getting one star , but won 't let me post without it . )
0	everyone always giving attitude . managers sometimes provide good service but not always . either hire more people or more competent people .
0	includes nothing . sides such as a potato is 9 $ . soup 8 $ . salad 10 $ . so dinner and one drink is 75 $ . stupid .
0	we sat down 37 minutes ago placed our order , got our drinks and seem to have fallen in a deep abyss ... i am not going to even bother rating the food as i will not come back here . terrible terrible service . 40 minutes now and still no waiter ... the people next to us who sat down and just received their food .. we did not . surprise ! we just received our food . i will comment on the food . the ketchup was new as my wife just had to remove the cap to peel away the seal . yea ! ! !
0	i took the dog back up and the owner told me " oh the water causes them to change color , " um yeah after 6 hours . this is the first negative post i have ever yelped but it was so bad i had to say something . just terrible .
0	what a joke not worth $ 5 bum was so brown it looked burnt and completely covered with poppy seeds ordered med rare was done too much and the taste wasn 't anything special
0	i should have shopped around . tried one of their 6 dollar burgers ... meal came to a whopping $ 12 ! ! ! little taste for a barely warm bacon cheese burger ... dry fries .... i wont ever repeat ... even mc.d 's would have been better , and i hate mc.d !
0	3 bucks a hot dog , detroit coney but i have to say the hot dogs were good but very over priced and no candied onions really
0	fries we 're cold , no sauces added or asked . server has no clue if meat was dark or white meat chicken . sign posted out of coffee , but menu states it is 100 % accurate as server tells us no biscuits only mcriddles . horrible and i love mcdonald 's . now we 're nervous our food has been contaminated
0	took over 10 minutes to get my 1 sandwich . most of the time , the employees were standing around ... pretty lackluster .
0	omelette came with no toast or home fries for $ 12 . omelette was dry and tasteless . if you like overpriced food then go here . the staff was not very attentive
0	there are far too many options to waste money at this place . un-drinkable !
0	$ 3 for a small bowl of chicken noodle soup ( from can and water down ) yuck ... sandwich was simple .. with one piece of lettuce and one piece of tomato ..
0	a simple question had to go around in circles of rapidly aggravating communication - my question - do you have a fucking side of coleslaw and if so , how fucking much is it ? over that , i just about leaped across the counter and strangled the snotty little shit giving me attitude over a simple question that he seemed incapable of either understanding or answering . i don 't need the aggravation over borderline mediocre food .
0	-3 if i had a choice if you like good food please don 't go here it 's all about the presentation no the taste it was just after my first maybe my only wedding not only i waited 2 / 3hours for the food it was horrible please go somewhere else
0	3nd time i have been there and all times have had membrane still on the ribs ( still can 't figure out why i went the second and third time ) .also no thought or money spent in dinning " ambiance ... " go somewhere else
0	there is no way around this . poor water flow and the half glass shower is not cutting it . lady luck elevators are still present although covered up with some faux wood trim . promotional credits were not granted to me even though i had given cristina the code at the front desk . shady . there is tons of potential here to be a 4 star based on the value .
0	never going again or recommending . it truly is all about fresh food and great sanitation practices ! !
0	3 of the 6 people in our party got sick after eating here .
0	owner was quite nice but disappointing food . not factoring the sickness .
0	3 of us came in for dinner at 10pm at 10 : 40 , no food no waitress to be found staff sitting at the bar i asked where my food was no answer one girl went to the kitchen , came back and never gave us an answer i finally asked for my check for our drinks she said there was no charge i asked the girl if she can think of any reason i would come back and she just she was sorry no reason was given this the a place run by amateurs and should be avoided
0	happy hour prices are good but if u can 't get service it 's not worth it . save ur time and go across the street & enjoy a $ 2 pint plus better service .
0	the 4th one ordered pan seared scallops . sent everything back . scallops were raw and the " halibut " wasn 't halibut at all ... the chef came out and admitted it was sea bass . each of the preparations tasted strange . to make it worse , even though we were nice about it our waiter wasn 't ! another young server came over to appologise . not a place i would recommend .
0	2 of us had horrible bland food . 1 of us had steak & frites , but was quite expensive for ... steak and fries . not too sure how long they 're going to last . the single star here was for the location and our waitress , who was quite nice . not too sure about other places , but toronto has a long list of places where staff should be booted in the lake , and not in front of customers . i was looking for something much better , but this completely failed .
0	3 out of 3 meals went back and still no manager bothered to come over to our table , still waiting ... second round of food was just awful and still no manager finally gave up , had the french toast and left .
0	we took it to go otherwise would have sent it back . not trusting to try again . update : we got food poisoning that evening .
0	the other 2 had already ordered and were waiting for their food . no one at the counter , no one acknowledged my presence for about 5 mins . i commented to the man next to me that with this few customers , no one should be waiting - for anything . after another 5 mins . , i get disgusted and leave . f * @ k . that .
0	3rd and final attempt. same old story with the food , takes too long to come out and portions are really small for what you pay for. this time the service was terrible. the waitress never came back after taking our orders until we were finished eating. an expediter brought our food. we sat for a really long time , as a family of 4 , all waiting for refills on our drinks. she took forever to bring us the bill , and forever to bring it back. worst experience at kona grill yet. never again .
0	1st time was rudely told meatloaf wait was at least 1 hour 2nd time- counter staff was rude 3rd time- music was so loud we could not have a conversation at our table and the same counter person as 2nd visit was arguing with a co-worker / manager while 10 people waited in line behind me . counter person told the manager " then send me home " so all the waiting customers could hear . staff seems very unprofessionally and inexperienced ie : people need silverware to eat ... you have to ask for it , order soup-ask for a soup spoon .
0	im still trying to figure out what the big deal is here . thrice the disappointment . the pizza is nothing special , each time the pies are underdone , this is inspite of the insistence that they bake them well done . i would expect that would not be a problem given the hour + the pizza took ( was quoted 25 -30 min ) . the pizza overall i find bland , the notable exception was the peperoni , a higher quality than average . but that could not offset the below average balance of everything else , dough , sauce , cheese , and most notably the service . i guess the hipster millennial types flock for vegan fair ? .
0	all 3 times the food was not very good . party of 8 and all of us agreed no more going back . maybe they 're known for something that we haven 't tried yet . on a side note . the lay out is pretty bad too . where we were sitting it was so tight we had to keep moving our seat in and out to let people and waiters go by . not a very enjoyable experience at all .
0	3rd time gone on my lunch time always forgets to give me f ranch and ketchup , wait time 15min , on top of that the lady thats deliver the food , plays the little game , oh you want your change shit , , ,
0	3 times poor service or food quality . i think it 's all back of the house . this time , fire alarm went off for 5 minutes , under cooked sliders , over cooked eggs , over cooked chicken , a burger half well done the other have medium rare and cold food . but at least it only took an hour to get it . a shame menu sounds good and when they execute , it can be good
0	we ordered the garlic noodles , bone marrow , and the crab mac and cheese . sad to say all of the food came out cold . i don 't think i will be back .
0	ordered theportugeuese sausage and pancakes . the eggs i ordered had a hair in it . the orange slice in the side seemed like it was a sun dried orange . side of rice ordered was barely a spoonful . server forgot my request and i had to walk back and ask again . i 've been here before and it was great then but now not so good .
0	and offer no solution my management not here now ! a complete joke and food going down hill as well as service obviously ! not good !
0	i get that it 's off the value menu and jbox isn 't getting the revenue from other meals - btw i order all normal menu items . but i should absolutely get what i order . no excuses about that . i demand managers rectify this situation .
0	should have learned my lesson the first time . frys and burgers are always cold .
0	i 'll stick to atl for wings or the other wingstop location on 51st ave but even that location is a crapshoot . it 's a shame that you damn near have to stand over these people and hold their hands in order to get your wings prepared the way you specify especially considering wings are suppose to be something they specialize in .
0	service very mediocre . bordering on terrible . food is average . won 't be con
0	adding a 20 % tip for adult table of 6 is bush league . waited 30 minuets for our reservation , sent one meal back each visit , noisey and the worse element of our visit is that everyone thought their meal was bland and uninspiring . there are so many better restaurants including italian in charlotte . we won 't be going back .
0	waited for server to bring waters took her 10min then server sets them down and takes another table their drinks doesn 't return until she turns in their order then busses another table ! we left !
0	dinner-mate vomited for hours after eating the farm fresh green salad .
0	negative 10 for service . started off great . server immediately took our drink order , cleared one plate and then totally ignored us for the next 2 hours . he kept walking by our table and avoiding eye contact with us . he serviced other tables that arrived but completely avoided us . we were nice and polite to him the entire time so we are baffled . this wasn 't just bad service , it was no service . this lunch was supposed to be the highlight of our trip but it was the biggest disappointment .
0	3 times we have tried to give them a chance to redeem themselves and three times they have proven us wrong ! dont cook food properly . well done burger came out barely cooked on more than one occassion ! $ 6.50 regular size draft beers . long waits for food . the manager did comp the entire bill but we will not ever return . this was their last chance at redemption and they totally blew it we will not return .
0	this is my 3rd visit to a texas roadhouse here in phx area and they all suck ! food served cold , ribs left over from the nite before served to the early diners and are cold , dry , dry , dry ! and awash in sauce to mask it all ! ! too bad as the concept is great ! , never again for those prices i will go somewhere good !
0	third time here and have never been impressed with food or service . this time i went for happy hour and same results .... disappointing . you would think sitting at the bar you would receive attentive service , wrong ! we were never asked if we needed anything else ... water , food , drinks . food was dry and tasteless and ambiance was bland . with so many fabulous steakhouses in vegas , why bother with this one . go elsewhere and get the quality , service and ambiance you deserve . never retuning . three chances was too much of a waste .
0	bad employees ... one in the newspaper for refusing to help a customer in trouble . very bad
0	on same 3 visits the order not just wrong . epicly wrong . called 800 number to just see if this was a common practice transferred 3 times to get someone who spoke english . no such luck . this kfc sets the bar for the worst service in the valley .
0	1 : completely wrong sandwich 2 : asked for a grilled chicken breast and somehow got crap chicken fries 3 : asked for an ultimate breakfast platter and got 1 sausage , 3 pancakes with a piece of cheese melted to the top pancake . my son is 8 and knows how to make food . is yall hirig or is you employing ?
0	the don 't take themselves offline on justeat when they can 't deliver so justeat refunded us the last time and advised they would be conducting a service review . looking at the reviews below i can see nobody has really had a good experience with these guys . i 'll go to the one on yonge street . they know how to take care of their customers .
0	chicken is very , very dry . had to send it back to the kitchen . 2nd batch was better .... but just the thought that they could have brought out the dry chicken to begin with ! took too much time to get it right . sigh , i used love swiss chalet when i was growing up . tisk tisk ...
0	especially when the chili is ok and the dog doesn 't even snap in your mouth . disappointed .
0	ridiculous . the food was okay , not worth $ 40.00 for what we were served . ouch
0	honestly save ur $ $ $ grab a burger at in n out . so much better . shakes too . we had the waygy or kobe some ultra expensive meat and all my friends were just so excited . no flavor ! slow ass service ! !
0	food was terrible , no real variety . seafood was extremely salty , sausage had a raw feeling texture . if it had garlic in it , there was way too much . the service was terrible , i only say the waitress when i waved her down for a straw . i 'll never come here again and will advise all my friends and family to never come here either .
0	? i understand high prices , coming from palm beach , but when the view is of the airport and the food is barely " okay , " tor should be embarrassed . nothing about this place warrants their high menu prices , except maybe their renovation bill .
0	this place is no shwartz 's . portion size doesn 't match the $ $ .
0	that 's high for any restaurant . i really wanted to order delivery but unfortunately , i don 't need $ 40 worth of food ...
0	lmao . what a joke . never in my life . hope my order is right . who let these clowns by a restaurant . not sure i even wanna eat now . 25 bucks shot to hell . update . i had a 4 minute ride home , and the food was cold and un-eatable . amazing . never again . absolute joke to the peeps that own this place .
0	two dozen plates sitting under hot lamps unattended . absolutely ridiculous . horrible service .
0	would have been good to know when we ordered .
0	the smoked meat sandwich is half broken and cannot be picked up at all . we paid $ 2 for extra " swiss cheese , " but we received a small slice of kraft cheese from subway . you will lose so much money from eating here , because time is money .
0	? there was only 3 tables including ours -waitress did not refill our water once -30 dollars for 8 squared slices , i was expecting delicious pizza ( tasted really salty ) i 'm a huge pizza fan , i eat pizza all the time and i 'm constantly trying new places . i follow pizza twitter accounts , i dream about pizza in my pizza pyjamas ... ok maybe not but i freakin love pizza and this place makes my inner pizza fan want to die . bad service , mediocre food , will not be returning .
0	i have never waited 40 minutes to have breakfast . very disappointed ... hopefully they get it together with a breakfast bar since there was only two of us or get more tables inside and out . a lot of people walked away because of the wait - they are loosing a lot of business ! ! ! the one star rating is for this disappointment only since we were not able to try their food - maybe next time .....
0	pickle barrel is a strange place , originally an up market deli , they have forgotten what deli food and portions are and try to pump out sort of nouveau-neo-healthy-cusine that also misses the mark . latkas that look like hockey pucks , deli sandwiches that look anemic are all served out by a staff that wouldn 't know deli if they walked into one and don 't give a damn about the customer . i would suggest that rose reisman go to thornhill , montreal or new york and see what deli is and then try again .
0	oh well ... maybe another location will be willing to take my business ... i explained to them when i first got here that this was my first time here , you would think this would give them the heads up to be willing to explain how the process or order the food and you can choose what bread. avoid this location and the gm powell worst customer service i have come across hey i 'm sure laura fisher his boss is okay with how he treats the customers .
0	i don 't want to go overboard , a lot of good people work there ; so , to famous dave 's : get better at qc .
0	terrible service . wasted our time completely with no remorse other than " our ticket times are backed up " but everyone else got their food and refills except us , the minority table . but their chefs are back there laughing and popping french fries in their mouth while we 've been out of drinks and fries for half an hour .
0	we both ordered the farm fresh eggs breakfast and coffee . our eggs were cold , the potatoes were dry and tasteless and the bacon was cut so thick that when chewed it had the consistency of rubber . do yourself a favor and go somewhere ( anywhere ) else
0	they were out of the ingredients for the pb & j for the entire week of our stay , and the caprese took 10 + min to make because they had to " go downstairs to get the mozzarella . " what ? why do you not have the ingredients on hand to make take out items ? food was mediocre too . huge disappointment after getting excited about the menu . : (
0	what a ripoff . there was an average ( at best ) band playing and an overcrowded dance area ( that could have been made larger if they moved some tables ) . there were tons of drunk people . i mean really drunk , like people had to hold them up . i will not be back . i really wanted to like the place but just wasn 't feeling it .
0	barely anyone here yet . sounds like service might be good right ? wrong . after being seated , patiently waiting for the waitress to finish braiding their hair in this empty resturant . 15 minutes later no one had yet even asked if i wanted water . instead . the waitress got a drink for herself and seated herself at a table . nice . that drink looks mighty tasty . 5 minutes later . i got up and left . tl : dr. service sucks .
0	i could vaguely tell that it was delicious at one time , but not when i ate it . bored staff with no pride .
0	i had to fry it up in bacon grease just to make it edible ! wtf ! i could have made a better cinnamon roll with stale bisquick . don 't waste your money here ....
0	worst food experience ever . i cannot recommend this place to even my worst enemy .
0	the managers are no help in expediting . when asked how much longer the crew replied no idea . there have been 3 tickets in front of mine for 15 min . customers are asking for money back and leaving. oh goody , the manager is handing out coupons and apologizing for the wait . looks like she 's starting with the customers that just got here. meanwhile still waiting .
0	service and food quality had already gone down . avoid this place !
0	food was not worth the wait . overpriced and service was terrible
0	food : okay service : friendly but ultimately bad-- screwed up one order , kept ignoring our empty water bottle , didn 't chase away a bum in the outdoor seating area until after 5mins of begging for money ( awkward ! ) ambience : good . location : great .
0	somehow our ticket was lost . about 25 minutes in , the manager came over to retake our order . not much of an apology was given , offered to comp one of the dishes after we inquired . the server was awful . in the 45 minutes we were there , she stopped by twice to check in , only after another server overheard us complaining about the service . so much for having a hearty meal before an evening of boozing . we ordered pizza instead from another place . the manager couldn 't give us an eta on our food so after 45 minutes , we left . good bread , horrible service .
0	22 before anyone even came to our table . i had to flag a waitress down . food isn 't good . will never come here again .
0	asked for american cheese but got a liquid nacho w / jalapeno flavored yellow stuff instead . everyone waiting for food looked upset at the long wait .
0	45 minutes for a mediocre fast food burger and fries ? did they drive somewhere else to order it and pick it up ? stay far away. even mcdonald 's is better than this .
0	don 't come here after midnight , unless you 're willing to wait an awfully long time for subpar food .
0	shrimp was of course overcooked as i am sure it sat on the counter for at least 20 of those minutes . fourteen employees on the floor who all seemed more involved dancing to the terrible music than taking care of their customers . restaurant was less than a third capacity yet they were making people wait to be seated ( up to 30 minutes while we were there ) . i like lots of televisions , but they were all on the same game . two nfl preseason games and three college football games plus multiple baseball and others could easily be found at the time . i blame the management . and we will never go back !
0	eggs overdone , yesterday 's limp lettuce . one hour before being asked if i would like a tea refill . lots of better places than this !
0	she brought 4 out and the rest of us have been waiting . it took our server tory 20 minutes prior just to take the drink order . then she comes to take our order for dinner before the drinks are even out ! ! ! she doesn 't even mention the wait ! it isn 't even that busy for a saturday . this is insane ! we 're sitting here and they are ruining my sisters birthday dinner . i can only imagine the wait for the food and anything else we need for the rest of our dinner . so disappointing . i will be letting people know my experience and to warn them never to visit here . sad .
0	we know it will be even longer because the man who ordered before us , is still waiting . the staff seems oblivious to how long people are waiting for their food . since we have been waiting , no one has bussed dirty tables . having run into this situation before we decided to give it one more try . ugh !
0	they act like they are doing you a favor to let you stay at their hotel . i waited 20 minutes to get bags from the bell hop , and express checkout means you skip the 30 min line to check out at the desk , but still don 't have my bill to file my expense report after 5 days . tried to call to get my receipt expedited , waited on hold for 15 minutes , no one ever picked . stay at the bellagio , they appreciate their customers ,
0	45 minutes to get a delivery when i am less than a mile away pathetic for a company that 's motto is freaky fast
0	no manager ever came by even though we told the waitress that we were very disappointed . we will never ever go back .
0	10 minutes seeing how the managers and employees argued about that she did wrong . 15 minutes to get a refund
0	every table sat around us got tgere food . then a gentleman comes out when i said we wanted to leave and says " sorry , we were busy . " the other server that came over tried hard to recover us . she did a great job but it was just too little too late . not a good way to handle the situation . will give it a try again , hopefully a one time deal .
0	? ! didn 't even receive any utensils or napkins , and our server was nowhere to be seen . wish i had gone anywhere else .
0	bacon is not a vegetable guys. the food itself tastes good .... once you get it right ... thanl god im only here on business bc i would tell everyone i lnow to avoid this location .... its also expensive ! the prives are exploitative . period .
0	what they don 't tell you until you get here is that there is a $ 26 resort fee per night . this is not , by any means , a resort . in fact , this place is pretty doggone disgusting . i 've stayed at a lot of places , this is probably second from the bottom in my many years of travel . the shower has mold or mildew , don 't want to look too close , and there 's hair in the sink . i 'm pretty hard to gross out , but this place is nasty . i would recommend you look at other options for a nights sleep .
0	looked at the steaks and realized they don 't have one under $ 30 dollars . this isn 't the kind of place you order a $ 30-40 steak from . when i finally settled on a salad , you had the choice between a disgusting sweet tomato sauce like dressing and ranch - not even oil and vinegar . couldn 't wait to get out of there . avoid this place , there are plenty of better places in avon .
0	45 wait wow not in california no shakes machine broke gill down he only bucause we love the food well we need to love it in california only
0	didn 't feel like complaining so i 'm taking my frustrations out here .
0	$ 47 for a large take out pepperoni pizza and large chopped salad is a little high considering the food is nothing special .
0	i would not recommend this place the food was awful and the service was awful awful ! ! all eight of us were very disappointed ! !
0	not joking . the waitress brought coffee and never came back . my wife grabbed another waitress and asked about our food . her response was that there are a lot of tickets in the kitchen . the place was busy , but not crazy busy . i felt really bad for the handicapped child at the next table . he waited at least 1 / 2 hour to get served . bad experience .
0	i was still hungry after we left here and it wasn 't even that good ! my boyfriend and i had finished our ' food ' by the time the other couple we were here with got their food . i 'd rather go to costco and get four of their huge hotdogs for the price of this one gross one .
0	wow ! ! ! and to top it off bread was really dry and the skimped out on meat . jesus ! ! ! never again ! stay away from this place and save your money !
0	slow as it can get service . place is filthy dirty . struggled to find a clean table . fryalator alarms sounding the entire time . employees either to dumb to turn them off or they just did not give a crap . keep driving and find something better . how they stay in business is amazing ! ! ! !
0	4 fingers ( two of them wouldn 't even count as a kids meal nuggets ) for $ 13 .... sad how a company as big as pt 's would take advantage with false pretense of a bucket of finger ( not say 4 fingers for $ 13 ) ...... nevrr again shame on you pt 's ... what a ripe off ! ! !
0	two stars because they have a vegan dish . an embarrassment is the best to be said . on second thought , i have to lower my review to one star for having vegan dish .
0	had both the beef burgers and veggie burgers which was ok . but not worth what they were charging . pretty disappointing .
0	we walked all over the strip to find a good cup of coffee . mcdonald 's coffee is far superior . that should give you an idea had bad this coffee tasted . sorry mcdonald 's , i should not have compared you to such horrible coffee . side note . the service was really good .
0	4 of 6 meals have been total screw ups however the servers and bartenders are nice and they are closest to home so i kept trying hoping it was bad luck ...
0	one gentleman has already asked for his money back . this place has the slowest fast food service i 've seen . it also takes 5 people to answer 1 phone . the cashier stopped the orders just to make sweet tea . oh and not to mention they all have attitudes . not to mention we all have salads . one order has already been messed up . the line just got huge .
0	the food was very salty and the serving portions were inconsistent . this place is over priced for the quality of food they serve . i would not recommend this to anyone .
0	we made a reservation online only to get to the restaurant and it be empty . the doors were locked , there was no sign or the restaurant and no answer on the phone . everything online indicated they were still open . it was a bummer , we walked over to snooze instead .
0	everything from food to service was terrrrrible . guess i should have read the yelp reviews before coming . don 't waste your time with this place , it 's a shit show literally
0	will travel to goodyear to go to zupas from now on and elisa worst attitude ever . put yourself in the customers shoes dont get rude
0	at least a 45 min. wait to be seated . 5 empty tables that seat 6 . we were told that there isn 't enough servers to handle the customers . wtf ? is the manager that stupid that he can 't anticipate that there is going to be a crowd ? ?
0	the fries were good ... alot to pay for good fries though . the tuna melt was not a tuna melt . toasted cheese bread with bland tuna , not even sure if it was albacore . the grinder is a " subway " status sub , but smaller . never again .
0	i don 't over eat at buffets , i much prefer quality over quantity so this place was a " may-jor " disappointment . foods were bland , stale from sitting under heat lamps or in the built in chafing dishes . salads were wilted . desserts were just pretty , but tasted pretty nasty . i won 't go back , i won 't recommend it for anyone looking for a place to eat in vegas . as a matter of fact , if someone asked my opinion , i 'd tell them they were better of at in-n-out .
0	are you kidding me ? ! i just had what was probably the worst meal in las vegas . slow was the nicest remark i can make . the $ 15 margaritas were a sickening sweet mix served over ice . the fried calamari had no flavor , the " risotto " was inedible . one does not merely squeeze a few globs of rice into a cream soup and declare it risotto . the lobster portion had turned--i spit it out , hoping it doesn 't make me ill . the meal was removed from my bill , but i wasn 't aiming for a free meal , i wanted a decent meal .
0	pressed and formed precooked sausage patties were disgusting ! the only thing worse was the service ! they can keep their frequent user card !
0	try to order in person at the counter and they walk you back and tap on the screen for you . this is neither efficient or a novelty .
0	this place is gross . i 'd rather have popeye 's .
0	never open when it says it would be and never open any other day , i give up . i 'm convinced it 's a wrap for this place . hungry island died of starvation
0	it doesn 't matter if it 's breakfast time and you 're waiting in he drive thru or if it 's dinner time , expect to be here for at least 30 minutes . make sure you get them to repeat your order back to you before you pay and always ask for a receipt . better yet , keep driving to the next bojangles , you 'll have better luck and service .
0	we saw our " server " twice . we had to chase people down to get our drinks . the food was mediocre at best , i 've had better microwave tv dinners.the only thing i enjoyed was the coffee at the end . if you 're looking for a disappointing meal , try mcdonald 's instead ; at least you 're only paying $ 6 for a bad meal instead of $ 50 .
0	the waiter was nice but service was slow . a waste of money but i was in a hurry and starving .
0	my husband was surprised when they brought him 1 sausage link that is chicken and he simply stated that he didn 't realize it was a chicken sausage . the waitress then comes back with a plate of regular sausage links but gave it to him with an attitude and gave him a hard time . it was like she personally took offense to it and just gave him the sausages to make a point that she was offended . i could have gone to denny 's , eaten with a reasonable pace and be treated better . also , it took almost 15 minutes to just get my cappuccino ‍
0	no plates . after asking for a high chair four times we just went and found one . restrooms are ... no words to describe . is there any management running this place ? food is ok . service is . well there is no service .
0	50 min waiting on chicken and waffles chicken came cold and manager didn 't care she was chatting with employe and after 2nd time we call for manager still no luck and when we start walking then she came up to us one think this place needs new teem leader bottom line
0	barely defrosted crab that had no taste , really tough rib and " kobe beef , " and tiny pieces of stale raw fish on big slabs of rice pretending to be sushi . the only redeeming quality seems to be the desserts , but i wouldn 't have waited 1.5 hours and paid $ 50 for apple pie .
0	will never eat here again . forgot to mention ... service was horrendous .. they did not refill drinks and never removed dirty plates .
0	i wonder if it because me and my wife are tattooed undesirables that don 't fit in with their clientele ? either way , you have 20 open tables and you are only willing to sit us if we sit outside ? i know where i am not welcome . so if you are under 70 and not quite the old white christian ideal ... maybe you would want to find a different place to spend your money ? i guess i don 't really have a choice .
0	they weren 't even busy ! not the first time this long wait for a salad has happened . i won 't be back . didn 't even get our food , had to be somewhere . thanks for wasting my time and enabling me from eating .
0	5 : 20 am rang their buzzer to be let in no answer so left was a group of 8 so we just found somewhere else
0	the mac and cheese was great but beans , slaw , brisket not so much . the brisket is half fat .
0	this is the fifth and last time for me . pastrami is perfect one time and the next it is full of fat and tuff . i have tried to be patient , but this was unbeatable this time . the don 't care what they cook or how it is sliced , so good luck ! !
0	probably going out of business soon . this is the second time that i 've gone there and they been closed one other time they were close because they had a private event. good riddance
0	seriously , this is the kind of food that leaves you queasy afterwards . we also had the fish tacos which consisted of rubbery fish , no seasonings , and some tortilla chips thrown on the plate . disgusting . i have eaten better food at applebee 's . i can 't believe this restaurant is part of the bellagio . that was the biggest waste of $ 75.00 ever .
0	overpriced , unoriginal , disappointing ... we walked 100 feet away after to smash burger and got double the amount of fries ( rosemary garlic ) for $ 3.50 ... stay away unless you want to waste money .
0	food is tasteless with no effort put in making them . don 't ruin your beautiful sunday morning eating here unless you are staying at the hotel and have no other choices .
0	not to mention terrible service . stay far , far away .
0	subpar service ! we are regulars at a different location and never have to deal with this crap . i assume poor management at the west side store is the reason for such poor service . at last he food arrived and the order was taken wrong ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i would expect nothing less ! ! !
0	crust was soggy ! spent over 20.00 for 3 slices and a am drink ! horrible taste ! ! ! ! never again !
0	went 10 yards across the street at the gas station and got the same thing for much less . ripoff .
0	i thought this place was supposed to be freaky fast ... i ordered a sandwich online at 1 : 01pm and it did not arrive until 2 : 00pm . called 40 minutes in and the girl said they are always understaffed and overwhelmed . i don 't even really like jj 's but i needed delivery on a busy day at work . never again . oh and the cucumbers were missing on my sandwich too . fail .
0	not a fan of that . the food is ok but gouging on beer is not .
0	from missing sandwiches , wrong chips , no drink , to the completely wrong sandwich toppings ... this jimmy johns delivery is about as organized as a junkyard . and for the " so fast you 'll freak " crowd , the last two orders took 40 minutes to be delivered to less that 2 miles away .
0	i ordered a medium plain burger , chili cheese fries , and a blueberry shake . i would not bring anyone here , nor will i ever come back here . the burger was burnt , lacked any seasoning or flavor and the best part of it was the brioche bun . my chili cheese fries lacked pizzazz . they used what looks like canned chili with little to meat and the fries were boring . we waited a long time just to get water .
0	that 's it . the berry salad was basically a piece of salmon on a few greens for $ 13 at lunchtime . not a value . skimpy !
0	this place has really refined their ways of screwing their customers . if they are screwing you on a fountain soda , imagine how else they are ripping you off . what a joke ! management must have their heads shoved so far up their a55 , completely out of touch , but in touch with milking you for every dollar . needless , to say won 't be coming back .
0	really inexperienced staff ( eg. taking dirty cutlery off the plates she was removing and putting them on the linen table - to keep and use again - didn 't know the menu - didn 't ask about the food .. ) the food was highly disappointing , med-rare steak was med-well but tasted like stagnant blood - nice huh - nothing was ' good ' - just not bad enough to send back . the prices don 't align with the quality of the food - or the freshness ( lacking ) . don 't go - you will leave saying the same - wouldn 't go back - wasn 't worth the money and the staff needs experience .
0	it was not crowded but we did finally get served once but were unable to get served a second time . we finally ordered a second time but never saw it . when we got our check the waitress said she would not charge us for the drinks we did not get , gee thanks . no reason to ever go back there .
0	hostess wouldn 't seat us without reservation . showed available on opentable 30minutes later . i won 't stop by here again out of principal . i 'll go give north harbor my money for brunch . this isn 't nyc .
0	not enough chicken in chicken pasta plate . chicken sandwich meat in club and only two slices . not very clean restaurant . service was great though . not going back anytime soon .
0	when we do get our order delivered or picked up for our company ... something is always ' wrong or forgotten ! this franchise will never make it to the big leagues and a smart competitor will comes along and show them how it 's suppose to be done ! a shame the sandwich 's are good , but pricey ! good luck & good riddance !
0	-4 stars for the horrid service . been here 3 times , all 3 times it 's taken 25 minutes for the server to take the order and another 35 minutes for food . then it 's another 30 minutes to track your server down to get the bill . i 've seen every table complain and the manager come to apologize and tell us they 're understaffed . 1st time was ok but the next 2 times ( different times of the year ) doesn 't make sense .
0	everything was salty and tasted like we were eating cafeteria food . i was not " surprised " by the " surprise " meal , it was kinda of boring . 1 star for the decor , it was a stuffy basement restaurant ( not in the actual dark dinning room , but in the entrance bar area ) we ate late , so when we left we noticed that one of the servers who was leaving at the same time was actually not blind ( not that it was advertised that she was but she was wearing dark sunglasses in the restaurant ) ... again im not accusing just highlighting .
0	very tasty . 0 stars for the customer service . waited over 3 hours in line to pay $ 60 per plate . when my party of 7 went to pay before being seated , we were told our party had to split into a table of 5 and a table of 2 . i drove 12 hours to meet with family , and was willing to wait longer to sit together . multiple staff members assured that there was no possibility and we were forced to split up . when being seated , there were plenty of open tables for groups of 8 ! i couldn 't believe it .
0	i don 't blame them for my dissatisfaction ... it 's the flavor or lack there of with the food that disappoints me . seriously , spent $ 40 on food that " blaze pizza " could do better . hell , little caesars is better tasting .
0	at first i couldn 't tell if the waiter pavle was charming-then i realized he was a pompous , condescending a-hole . the food was ok , not great , not awful . never again .
0	soggy tasteless bun . meat okay . if you ask light on the condiments they still put so much on it spills over all over the place . fries are under fried . positive is the fountain pop is good . otherwise , this place wouldn 't make it in the top 100 burger list .
0	tonight was 2nd night and we wanted a drink downstairs . 1 bartender who was slightly tipsy because it was his birthday and was having a few . 30 + people . waited 20 minutes to be talked to . no wait staff . empty drink glasses everywhere . for being the new hot and trendy what we experienced tonight would not bring us back . we told the hostess table as we left so we hope they make some changes .
0	) ... i hate to admit it , but we would eat something there at least 2-3 times a week . now , the pizza / cheese tastes different , way over greasy / oily , people will pay a few dollars more for quality ( and support a local business ) . it 's almost like the ingredients were much higher quality when it first opened . if there was a change , back to the initial high quality and care ... we would be back , sorry old friend .
0	table was never washed ! cafe mocha tastes like warm water . cup has run all over . what a mess . we 'll see about the food . bacon , eggs and hash browns all cooked to perfection . coffee grounds in the bottom of my cup .
0	sadly , that has changed . i have dined there twice within the last month and it seems everything has gone south . food quality , food portions , service , speed , friendliness ... all have grossly deteriorated . montana meat company is now on my personal list of " never again 's , " which is not an easy task to accomplish . if you are in the area and looking for a decent steak there are few options , other than giuseppe 's on the weekends or the summerlin venues which are a bit further of a drive .
0	girl who brought out food was completely unprofessional and rude . time to hire a competent staff .
0	nuff said . food was nothing short of unspectacular . service was good .
0	1 acknowledgement from the waitress in that whole time . terrible service , regardless if you 've been the only server there all day .
0	no photos . just a honest review of the food because that is what matters . we came here because it was convenient so we would not brave the heatwave , over a 100 degrees and it was only 830am . my friend sent his eggs back because they were cold . i finished my simple breakfast of warm eggs and potatoes . the first round of coffee was luke warm but the refill was hot . my other friends steak was flavorless . for 5 of us and a bill of $ 136.00 they should have refilled our water glasses . do yourselves a favor ... stay away ! there are plenty of better restaurants in vegas ... even the low rated denny 's is better .
0	bartender was the worst she took 35min to give me my food after i ask her twice , after 35 min she gave me my food that had been siting there for more then 20min . i ask to speak to her manager but that was useless , they had nothing else to say . but " do you have any problems " i left because i didn 't want to be rude . but heck yeah i had a problem . the useless barterder check my food twice and confirmed it wasn 't mine , then desided it was and gave it to me cold . this is a stupid practice to any bussines .
0	a single order of food took over 35 minutes to arrive , when it did arrive it was already cold . after the food arrived i ordered a glass of water and a beer . the server never returned so after 25 minutes i went to the bar to get my own glass of water and beer . there were four servers , a manager , a bartender , and eight patrons on the floor in the entire place and still the service was nonexistent or poor at best .
0	service was very good ( nice lady , we spoke dutch ) and the portions were adequate . we 'll go again and will recommend it to my dutch friends . thanks monique .
0	basic 2 egg breakfast with pork sausage links . eggs were overcooked , hash browns under cooked , toast was cold . coffee mugs are so small i felt like i was having a pretend tea party with my daughter . very unimpressed . had much higher expectations with the name of this place . won 't be back
0	are you kidding me ? ridiculous . no apologies , nothing . not the first time either , according to the reviews on here . if you run out of ribs several times , you might think about smoking more for the day . another couple was going in as we were leaving , and turned around and left because no ribs . you 're a bbq restaurant , you should never run out of ribs . gimme a break .
0	i 'm starting to think they just aren 't coming . my hotel bill is astronomical now . why won 't abc call me back ? i just want to go home so i can see my family again .
0	the cheese the in made to order omelette was 1 / 2 cooked , the bacon was rubber , the sausage ugh ... wont be back .
0	i know why it 's that price. worst steak ever . had 2 bites and my jaw was sore from chewing. eggs were ok . bread choices were limited to white or wheat. spend a few bucks more and go elsewhere . but idid love watching the drunk wasteoides from drai 's eating there at 5 am
0	? ! i was extremely excited ... and you let me down . i think my jaw still hurts from the chewy steak i consumed that night ... thank god for a-1 steak sauce .
0	very overpriced . nice view that 's about it . ahi nachos come with a lot of chips and not much tuna
0	6 $ for canned beer no fountain drinks only bottled water for 2 $ no kids menu brisket sandwiches looked liked huge slabs of fat and the sides portions are tiny ... this place is way overpriced and not even close in comparison to rollin smoke bbq ... don 't waste your time or money you 'll be disappointed .
0	same screw ups . doesnt feel like food ever gets served , doesnt feel like they ever have customers . lousy . got dragged here . not gonna try again
0	it was about half full . it was very disappointing . one couple 's steak had to be sent back twice and after waiting for it 30 minutes , we just cancelled it . the side orders were warm at best . the server did not not want to be there . just a very bad experience and we will not return . the mgr. did not handle it well . we talked to some folks who ate there not long ago and it was a similar story .
0	one of which should have been popcorn chicken . just go to canes .
0	no ribs no pork . might as well just close for the night . hostess was very nice and apologetic . tc 's here i come .
0	i placed my order was told 20-25 minute wait , after 35 minutes , i approached the counter and now i 'm being told it will be another 15-20 minutes . everyone sitting and waiting for their orders have the same complaint . poor service , poor timely response . would never recommend this place to anyone .
0	after we sat , we waited an hour for our food ( which was totally mediocre , even though some items were " award winning " ) when the food came out after an hour , orders were wrong . they wanted to remake it but we told them to just fuck it , we waited too long already . also , water tastes like it was scooped out of the pool off the third floor .
0	not to mention , this place refuses to accommodate a large group even with long time reservations . the manager insisted he needed to keep the tables turning due to events happening in the area although , i counted 3 other customers while we were there . i love hrc in our travels and will always stop at one but this one has seen the last of me .
0	save yourself $ and walk to a burger joint ! service fast
0	also i 'd like to peg them for false advertising their sign outside says ask us about our $ 20 four course meal and then you get inside and you realize that 2 our of the 4 courses was a glass of water and the mint at the end . too high priced for me . * update * tried to go here for a conference and was so off put by how they treated our group that we forfeited a catered meal and took our business elsewhere . strike 2
0	$ 70 dollars for 2 apps and 1 deep dish pizza was nothing to write home about. the end .
0	the sauce and cheese isn 't too bad but the crust was like cardboard . go eat at johnie rockets instead
0	the cashier was very friendly but unfortunately the burger , and cheeseburger that we purchased were tasteless and the cheese curds were greasy . while traveling through the state a waste of time and money .
0	7 / 17 of the tables were empty which seemed to be a moderately slow night ... i 'm not sure what took so long for a long island and beer but the drinks alone from the bar took about 12 mins and the food was even longer ... it 's been well over 35 mins and we have still not been served ... i am seriously over this spot .. i really want to just tell the waitress , " no thank you " and leave but i 'm trying to remain kosher .
0	3 pm . high golf season in arizona ! three of us went to the driving range . " sorry , we are out of balls . the guy who picks them up won 't be back today . " good one , shalimar . you did not anticipate that people might want to golf in 71 degrees on a saturday . you just confirmed that my initial one star rating was not a mistake .
0	lime chicken barely cooked . kids mac : kid did not like . boneless chicken could of been cook longer .. nachos with stew meat pu. steak .. margarita limed up no punch ..
0	fairly empty dining room filled with dirty tables . hostess offered to seat us at a bar hightop , or we would have to wait 5 min for a clean table in the dining room . we chose to wait . after 15 minutes , approached the 4 employees that were socializing at the hostess stand . i was treated rudely , and reminded that i had to wait . we left . last time that we go there ! ! * not certain , but i believe it was the manager that was rude of us .
0	good morning welcome to mcdonalds , we have run out of hash browns . what can i make for you ? ummm , i guess nothing now . ridiculous .
0	we waited 15 minutes and no one even acknowledged our presence . we 've eaten here several times before , but that 's not acceptable . we left and found somewhere else to spend our money .
0	$ 74 for 2 adults and 2 children my burger was not cooked bun was a week old the whole burger was cold ... kids burger the cheese was so thin it only had one side very disappointing .... non of the buns were heated to toasted ... will not recommend : (
0	3 or 4 tables empty inexplicably given the line . shell pieces in crab benedict ... if you 're still reading it wont matter what else i could list .
0	everything was cold , under cooked or over cooked . we gave up on breakfast and tried the shrimp and crab legs just hoping to try to get something for our money . the shrimp were good but the crab legs were frozen . needless to say we ate about 10 bucks worth of shrimp and left . i have to say i was very disappointed and left angry that i just paid a premium for really horrible food . i would never go back . do yourself a favor skip this and go anywhere else .
0	my complaint got me a blank stare . adios .
0	79 cent hot dogs for 7.00 each toasted stale bun that fell apart on first bite don 't even pretend that this is a hot dog place but staff great and beautiful patio
0	yesterday for some crazy reason i went back to eat there , and i got a large black hair inside of my fish taco . i will never eat at this restaurant again , i will never recommend this restaurant , and the manager came over and argued with me as well about it . i 've reported them to the health department
0	$ 7 dollars for a luke warm corona never even offered a menu and the bartender carded the girl who sat down next to me after he noticed he didn 't know how to make what she wanted .
0	? ! . plus the waiter was so dry .... how can a waiter be so dry ? no customer service training probably . i won 't be going back there .
0	the sad part is that no one here . may be 30 people it 148 pm . just to sad i will not come back .
0	i was inside and there was no one in front of me . i rarely come to this location because it always takes this long whether its peak times or not .
0	if it 's late at night , and you 're tempted by poutini 's , keep walking up to the lakeview lunch and get an acceptably priced poutine .
0	i came for my favorite flatbread ... not sure we 'll get that far. would be surprised if this place is still in business in a week .
0	$ 6.85 including tax for a domestic beer .... total rip off ! they brought my food 20 minutes before my friends so i was done by the time she got hers and we couldn 't eat together . smoke meat sandwich that my friend got looked about half as full as the montreal counterparts and had a bunch of fat chunks in it even though she ordered lean . don 't believe the hype .
0	80 dollars and no dessert and no coffee do not cume here no toothpick and charged me for dessert that was given to somebody else and then charge me 18 % tip will never go here ever again
0	save your wallet and still being hungry after ! ! !
0	i refuse to go to any more restaurants where i can see my server talking / texting on her cell phone while she / he is running my goddam credit card . when are you owners going to take control ? ? ? ! ! ! ? ? ? sure , they may not be ripping me off , but when i have been ripped off , this is how it happens ... take your head out of the sand and make policy ... no cell phones at the pos machine ... duh - you own a restaurant . straight to zero goes cb and cb ... do not go here if if you hate risk o
0	busy but given a table right away . staff pleasant . olives good . 4 cheese pizza ... not so great . crust in middle kind of flabby . sauce was so bland it had no real taste . where was the cheese ? ? ? dough itself pretty good. pretty pricy for quality of food. wont go back.also very noisy .
0	8 / 26 / 17 i will never again drive thru this burger king and order anything , waited way longer than needed for 3 whoppers and 3 fries and sm milkshake , person taking order was not able to get one single thing correct from the taking of the order , to the bagging of the order to even coming to car to bring what was not included in order to still missing food , had to walk in to get it right , food extremely cold , service extremely poor , and no one was even in the restaurant so what took so long ! ! ! ! !
0	i am craving a whopper so i whip into the drive thru . order a # 7 its late so i go with the whopper jr . as i salivate the whole way home nibbling on the fresh fries which tasted great , i am ready for the whopper ! open the wrapper and there is some sort of round chicken sandwich . how can nobody be in line and you screw up the 1 order you have . keep smoking and listening to khalid .. young dumb broke high school kids .
0	the girl mopping the floor ignored me . the rest of the crew was oblivious that someone was at the cash register . yelled out anybody taking orders ? someone named sharon came out and greeted me with they are out of hamburgers and whoppers . easily the worst burger king i ever been to . should not be in business . ended up going to the one on cheyenne near durango .
0	love the restraunt but sure put a bitter taste in my mouth talking to her . i asked her if dropping my 837 club and palms was my only option and she said it was my option . never ask to check my account .
0	sat my self in a booth , the other waitress saw me and ignored me , finally i walked up to the counter , nothing ! this was one of my invisible days . as much as i wanted to try their food , i would never come back here ever again : $ this is like a rejection of patronage hehehe we saw you and we don 't want you here lol well , , , heard ! loud and clear : ) i still don 't get it ? ? ? ! ! !
0	just told me it 's closed . really ? good riddance ! how are you still open ?
0	20 mins later we get our drinks after stopping a waitress to order them . we then ordered our food and at 10 : 45 went to find the manager as we still did not have our food . it arrived shortly after . 2 of us order surf and turf ( $ 80 ) and the lobster was dry and tough , and the filet was just ok . 3rd person ordered seabass which made her sick . 4th order ribeye was good . sights of the city was the highlight . service was the worst i have ever had for such a fine dining restaurant . will not go back .
0	the buffet should be hot ! my eggs were cold and the waffles will be used as a frisbee at the family picnic . the quiche was brought out cold ! i had to ask to heat it up . for $ 10 a plate , i should have gone to first watch . p.s. only place that serves ho-ho 's on the buffet . lol . classy .
0	hell man this is a local resturant that is not open for business . crazy
0	however , you had one fucking job . put 4 mcgriddles in the bag and hand me my coffee ! the coffee clearly has been sitting out because i got iced and it was warm as fuck . then i get home , and they 're biscuits not mcgriddles . the guy messes up the orders in front of me as well . you work at fucking mcdonald it 's not that hard . warm the shit up and put it in the bag . no thanks , i 'll start going somewhere else .
0	no manager ever came to speak to us . isn 't the gold standard for fine dining to check on your client after mishaps . no accommodations or adjustments were made . also , the waiter said its hot outside so , your " clothes will dry quick ..... " we had not even started our meal and my wife was soaked . what we should have done was left , changed and had your staff made us new meals . but we stayed and kind of expected a manager to make things right . it never happened . we won 't be back .
0	everything are in small portion and not much choices but charging $ 25.99 per person . too expensive . deserts are looks weird , taste really bad . i rather go somewhere else in same price but taste extremely better than this resturant . no return for sure .
0	- seriously bun and lettuce hot - 1 / 2 the cheese stuck to the paper . dave is rolling in his grave : (
0	waitress said she had a difficult order she had to put in , thats why it took so long . so okay give her a break on that but seriously it took 25mins for the food to come out after ordering and it was barely warm . plus mine was wrong . the two couples who came in 10mins after us got there food at the same time . asked for more fries they weren 't even warm . definitely blame management cause clearly the waitress didn 't have the capability to take care of that # tables and were barely there to support their employee .
0	staff seemed unconcerned about the wait even though the restaurant did not seem that busy ( empty tables , no big parties ) . rarely saw our waitress . food was okay but nothing special really . had the " bottomless " mac and cheese ... greasy clumps of noodles , cheese and veggies ... seemed plopped in a bowl . others at our table left food on their plates ... pretty blah stuff . very disappointed .
0	food and service was fine , so why the 1 star ? this was my only meal for the day , i ordered the octopus for an appetizer . i thought it was a bit " off " texture wise . two hours later severe food poisioning set in . i laid in the hotel bath tub from 11pm till 4am , ( spareing you the details ) . my complaint is honey salt will not even answer my emailed complaint . that 's the last $ 795.00 bill they will see from me .
0	they never get my order right . ive stopped going to this location all together . the parking ( if you drive a full size truck ) is less than desireable . the only reason im giving this one star is because i have too ...
0	had to return it . the alaskan king crab looked and tasted more like snow crab , very salty . would never go back .
0	she quoted $ 170 with tax and delivery . after giving the driver a $ 10 tip , i glanced at the bill and saw an amazing $ 245 . the owner was not prepared to assist by allowing the return of a dish despite the driver still being on site . her attitude was far from good business acumen . it 's unreasonable to expect the customer to loose in every way . much of the food was not to my taste and since the guests were offered everything , i was delighted to be left with nothing ! the owner had ensured food for an army , naturally at my expense ! ! this was a truly awful and unfair experience ! !
0	they treat us with little respect and constantly tell us the , " kitchen is closed . " tonight my boyfriend and i walked in an hour and 30 minutes prior to their closing time and were told the kitchen was closed despite the fact that there were numerous customers in booths around us and one couple had just ordered . coming from someone who works in the hospitality industry this is completely appalling and absolutely disrespectful . completely understand if you close early depending on how business is but i don 't understand why the hours listed online do not reflect this rule .
0	we yelled back to the kitchen ... hello and some lady yelled hello back , but no one ever came out front to take our order ..... we went to dennys across the parking lot ......
0	manager is just as rude as the staff . our waitress completely forgot about us . you can hear the staff using profanity within hearing distance of small children .
0	we visit vegas for a week . everything was great on our first visit in september , 2013 . our visit this year as it turns out is our last visit to this steakhouse ! service was the worse ! and they added a 20 % tip ! i really am surprised by the raves this place has received ! we were just there last week and it is no where as nice as it was in september 2013 ! i would be shocked if this place is still open come next september when i return for my next visit ! that is unless there are some major changes ! ! !
0	ordered shrimp bucket cold , got hot . ordered salad with balsamic vinegarette , got thousand island . ordered fish and shrimp , got nasty old fish . ordered dungeness crab , must have been shipped at least a month ago . manager came to table holding her stomach like she had some real pain . did the typical , will make it right , but to late . this was the worst $ 70.00 dollars i spent in a long time .
0	our 1st time & we will never go back ! 2 bad because we were excited ... too bad i had to give them one star
0	inside we were seated and began waiting for almost 10 minutes . we were then approached by our less than competent waiter , alonzo , who took our orders and then disappeared for almost 20 minutes . he then returned stating that there was no guacamole for the guacamole burger my friend had order . he provided no other suggestions or solutions to the order problem and then walked away . we received our food without ever getting our drinks , silver wear , or so much as a napkin . the restaurant was almost completely empty and the service felt very neglegant . safe to say i was disappointed with my experience
0	when we were finally seated it was in a room by ourselves full of empty tables . we had to wait for that ? ! the hostess couldn 't figure out how many adult menus we needed if we needed 3 kid menus . then she couldn 't figure out how many silverware after that 2 adult menu and 3 kid menu debacle . the service was so so slow . i actually had to leave before the food arrived . i will visit the broadway / priest or baseline / i-10 location from now on .
0	domino 's , have no fear ...... i 'll never be back .
0	there are no prices on the beer list . no big deal until they bring you your tab and they want $ 9 a pint . what beer is worth $ 9 a pint ? none at this place . garbage !
0	@ $ 9 they are gouging you wallet ! ! ! i won 't make that mistake again ! ! !
0	this is not the first time i have seen this here , but definitely the last ! !
0	better deal at cracked egg and better food . also my waffle was burnt and crunchy . not going back
0	the waitress forgot to put in my order . good way to ruin my anniversary " brunch " which was really just lunch . won 't be back the vue is not worth it .
0	i guess you can charge whatever you want when the airport doesn 't have any other options in concourse c
0	dirty environment , snails pace service . over inflated prices for food that is beyond sub par .
0	great food . best pancakes ever ! fast and friendly service ! awesome ! 6 weeks ago : still clean . portions shrunk . moderately friendly . a little slow . 3 days ago : restrooms dirty . sat at the diner bar and had at least 11 employees walk past on 10 minutes . i was the only one at the bar . left after 10 minutes with no acknowledgment of my presence . was there a change in management or does there need to be a change in management ?
0	took an hour to get delivered . and it tasted like garbage . highly encourage anyone to avoid this stinkhole . even the delivery guy was a dick .
0	but yet the tale next to us ordered after us but we can 't order ... hmm . they are seriously lazy about working at this restaurant .
0	after getting my entire order wrong i waited while they made the correct meals . at home 1 block away my meals were cold , hamburger looked and tasted like yesterdays . the fries limp and loaded with oil . if you can not get fresh fries at lunch time , when can you get it . we will skip this mcdonald it never improves
0	can they play the music any louder ? i guess talking to your friends isn 't allowed and i could hardly hear the waiter . i had $ 45 in gift cards and when i walked out i gave them away guy living on the street . i don 't have a use for them anymore . do yourself a favor and head across the parking lot to canes !
0	my family and friends have suckered me into eating here so many times . simply an epic fail on making over medium or poached medium eggs . service is always polite and personable even when missing the mark on attention to detail .
0	a 15 minute wait to drive through window pretty much invalidates your status as " fast food " i could have been served at a sit down restaurant and be done eating by now .
0	why not more authentic northern and southern cooking . want to experience italian american pittsburgh circa 1970 ? it 's missing the fried zucchini ; )
0	really ? 45 minutes to get us two sandwiches that weren 't that good ? save yourself the trouble and go to jack in the box .
0	we sent it back and the second tail came out as tough as the first . the manager asked whether it was better . when we told him it was not ( and we ate none of it ) , we were stunned to see it still on the bill . the steak , while cooked perfectly , was so salty that we could not taste the beef at all . the service was slow and unprofessional , although pleasant we paid the full tab and will never return . horrible experience .
0	stop selling all your chicken at the drive through , and balance it out with your inside customers !
0	we stressed that the kids were very hungry and it is now 8 : 15 and still no food . food may be good if it ever gets here but the service is horrible .
0	our stomachs are sick ! ! ! had the worst fish & chips ever ! ! ! it was so disgustingly greasy ! ! ! the vinegar was watered down or something and did nothing help it ! ! ! it was all you eat but i couldn 't eat much ! i did not even want their fries ! ! my husband got the calamari which was all batter ! ! ! and beef and onion pie which was mostly pastry with very little meat inside ! ! we almost tried the whole menu ! no happy ! the staff was so nice that we did not have the heart to complain to her ! ! will not go back !
0	we drove 15 minutes to grab 2 cheesesteaks ... one with meat and cheese only . get home to find the sandwich was covered in mayo . called in to simply let them know our order was wrong and asked if they could deliver the correct order , given that it was their error . the cook argued with me that we ordered it wrong and refused to help . such poor service .. which they could have made delightful really easily .
0	poor attitude , neglected us all night , screwed up the order and since she never stopped by to check how our meal was after it was delivered , well we never got to tell her . water cups not once refilled . the food , exceptional . i only got one drink and one appetizer ( won ton tuna tacos ) . the drink was amazing . the tacos were good but won-ton shells are probably not the best case for tacos- they break easy and the contents just spill everywhere . smh . if i come here again , it 'll be for happy hour and drinks only .
0	it tasted like garbage . and the place smelled like dirty rags .
0	confusing and margarita for a mojito , mixing up pork for beef and trying to convince me chickens have hair rather then feathers . this all before our mains have arrived . which we 're still currently waiting for . 30min and counting .
0	horrible service , okay food , and they change the channels to anyone 's whim . meaning , if a top 25 team is playing and two nothing teams are playing there is no rhyme or reason to changing the channel . won 't be back .
0	lost reservation and had nerve to ask me who i talked to . showed them the return call number my i-phone to no avail . if u make reservation , b sure to get name of the reservation taker and call back to verify !
0	this place reminds me of the ivy in la - and if that 's your scene then great - but upon noting this comparison , i immediately wanted to run / hide / cry but i couldn 't because my overpriced ricotta pasta-less pasta was still on it 's way . lesson learnt - if you 're into eating burnt eraser or hob nobbing with the vapid whilst paying ginormous amounts of money that would probably buy a few hundred med kits for kids in some developing nation - then yeah go at it !
0	almost every time they screw up . it 's so bad i 'm starting to loathe mcd 's as a whole . there 's always something wrong with my order . i 've called to complain and was told come in and we will give you a meal for free and they screwed up again . the soda fountain is infested with mosquitos wtf ? ? ? seriously if the owner takes the time to read this , you really need as someone has stated a huge intervention ....
0	we were unaware that it was wine tasting night and our experience sucked ! ! ! ! our server took our order and the next thing we know she was behind the bar while our food was getting cold . yummy i love cold food . not ! ! ! a guy came over asked what could he do for us what are you suppose to say this just shows inexperience on his part . they did take my dinner veal parmigiana back.this time i got 4 small pieces covered up in sauce and pasta was reheated.they did take off 2 of the cheapest dinners but what a wasted evening i am so disappointed and sad
0	the wedding soup had no flavor and substance . piccalos soup , food happy hour and ambiance is hands down much , much better ! ! ! !
0	food was just ok . wish the mill was still there . will not be back
0	i noticed a line for casino players , who walked right in and made us wait longer . i was not impressed with the food , for the price . the floor was wet and i almost fell . the aria buffet is a better deal .
0	i had the famous philly cheesesteak sandwich , mine must have come from denver .
0	i know the mid-west isn 't known for italian , but what they serve shouldn 't even be considered food . twice the entire place has stunk of rotten lettuce .
0	first of all my son got violently sick on their food . puls our appetizers were not hot but the lettuce in the salads were and the lobster was way over cooked . when we complained to the manager the owner came out and was totaly rude and did not correct any of the problems . horriable experence all around . will never go back and suggest you don 't go there either .
0	manager was an asshole about giving my money back . we ordered thru grub hub and got our food fast . but when it arrived it tasted old , flat soda , and the quality was horrible . called the manager back and he told me to complain to grubhub but we didn 't have a issue with speed . but the quality was awful . the guy is spoke with had an attitude his name is miguel espinoza and basically told me to go fuck myself . never go here never order from far burger here or anywhere .
0	i worked with a dedicated , goal oriented crew who strived to meet company values . we always had a clean restaurant , kitchen , dining room , even the parking lot . above all customer service was the number one priority . what i have seen at this location is not what arby 's corporate would like to see . filthy restaurant , the drink station specifically is disgusting , the floor is always sticky and gross , and the staff really don 't give a shit . i 've seen buns that are not toasted fully , wrappers not folded correctly , wilted lettuce , and just sandwiches slopped together . y 'all either need to fire the manager or just replace the entire staff .
0	good luck . if it was not for my daughter i would never set foot inside this place . i would rather pay 20 dollars for games at peter pipper and atleast all the game will work . thumbs down . i guess the creator of chucky cheese does not care if its franchise drowns .
0	the shawarma is dry due to being pre cut so early in the day . bland and tasteless . also had to return it for more toasting . the press was barely on . left it on for quite a well and still wasn 't long enough . service was non existent and had to yell for someone to attend the counter . everyone commenting about this place is right . it 's not good .
0	there is nothing at famous dave 's beyond mediocre . and the service is curt at best , flat out rude at worst . the food is about 1 step above tgifridays or applebees when it comes to bbq . if you 're looking for something more authentic and tasty , i 'd recommend checking out lucille 's bbq . significantly better food , and far , far better service .
0	not a clue how they stay in business , they were good years ago , but not any more .
0	the waitress was ok - refilled drinks without asking , but did forget to put in my side order so i had to wait halfway through my lunch for it to come . the food was pretty bad - wings were so fried the outside skin was difficult to eat , but the inside meat was pink ! also the pepsi was very flat and the onion rings were super salty .
0	i don 't know toby keith personally but i can 't imagine he would want his name associated with the kind of service i received .
0	chicken salad 3 pieces with uncooked areas . the rest is kinda detail . the main office got back to us re the tweeted picture of raw chicken , the local one didn 't even address it . looked up their ratings re health and safety and it appears to be a more institutional problem than this oversight .
0	and haven 't been back since it was a long ways to go . a friend and myself met yesterday at the scottsdale and shea location . i was very eager to eat there again . however this was probably the worst lunch i have ever ordered and will not be back . i ordered the philly steak it was so over cooked that i could not even identify the peppers and onions . the meat was so over seasoned and salty , parts of the meat were even burned . sorry for the poor review but it 's the truth .
0	coffee and other beverages are not included in the price , so a $ 12.99 buffet becomes $ 14.99 . the french toast was good , but not that good . and it was slow and service was nonexistent .
0	didn 't get what i asked for , toast was wet and soggy , scrambled eggs tasted like whipped cream home fries looked like they had been used before when asked about eggs was curtly told i was wrong .
0	inedible stinky crab cake appetizers and warm white wine followed closely by a nonexistent server when it 's time to pay . epic fail . avoid avoid avoid .
0	no one acknowledges you , employees act and talk as if they hate their job and life . the cashier if that 's what you call her , was about bright as a broken brick . the service is extremely slow and worthless . the owners / managers really should cut their losses and get people who actually want to work . sorry excuse for a place to eat . if i could give negative stars i would .
0	we were staying at the hotel at mandalay bay and i mistakenly suggested that we try the buffet for breakfast . service was horrid - it took forever to get coffee , juice , creamer . i think our server was busing tables too , so maybe they were just understaffed . every station had an insane line . the set up the restaurant is just bad - none of the sections have two sides so every area is a choke point . the food was marginal , at best . this was such a horrid mistake - unless you are into quantity over quality , skip the buffet and eat at someplace like citizens , instead .
0	it was not that busy , people waiting and standing for anyone to not only greet but to be seated as well . food is good but not worth the horrible service . it felt like only one person was working even though i saw a full staff . this is my last time . save yourself the trouble and eat across the street at twin peaks .
0	absolute garbage food ..... good service but the food is ridiculously overpriced for what you get .... steaks are dry and not cooked properly .... the management makes the customer feel bad for complaining about the food not being good .... no apologies , no refunds ..... the worst on the strip ...... do not eat here
0	food isn 't there at all , cold , old , and over saturated with bell peppers . service is nonexistent by both servers and management . this place really gives the scottsdale quarter and the city of scottsdale a bad name . just let it go already and let another restaurant take over .
0	went here as a local recommended it last night , he must have been drunk as hell . we left our food on the table . 2 bites out of each and we could stomach no more . this must be a regular occurrence there as the staff seemed not to notice the full table of ' food ' . begrudgingly paid the tab and tipped , as it wasn 't the severs fault the chefs are from craigslist . i can only imagine that this is what soup kitchens during wwii were like when food was rationed and meals were cooked on the same grill and instead of butter they used axle grease or lard from dead prisoners . do . not . go . here .
0	absolute garbage ... i 've never had food this disgusting ... if you can even call this food .. look at the pictures .... does this look like ribs to you ? chunks of meat in a stew .... and the smell ... wow ... this place should go out of business ... horrific ... $ 70 down the drain .
0	the rolls were soaking wet , the beef sandwich was painfully bland , and their hotdog was what i would expect at an elementary school cafeteria . horrible .
0	the service sucks , the food wouldn 't interest you dog , and the place is a mess . i won 't be back
0	the waiter bragged how they were better than texas de brazil which is actually comical . service was horrible , food was cafeteria quality at best and never do a groupon there as they have some tiny print that says you need 4 full paying customers to use it at $ 50 a pop . worst seafood ever ... imagine eating at dennys for $ 50 a plate ! save your money ... trust me on this .
0	absolute garbage. we waited over 30 minutes for our food. the fries are cold and the burger is burnt. thank god the meal is comped from the casino. none of the employees know how to cook , clearly .
0	absolute garbage. yelp wants me to add more than this so i will say that all of the food was garbage , the potatoes were garbage , the breads were garbage , the pancakes were garbage. absolute garbage
0	who doesn 't let a person know their food is ready for a to go order ? this place . then the manager has the nerve to tell me its my fault ? are you kidding me ? i 'm.glad i don 't live here but if i did i 'd never come back . got a refund which the manager tried to argue about not refunding my check for non-existent food . so i haven 't had the food . it looked mediocre at best .
0	the waitress didn 't care about us , and simply said " my bad " when she screwed up our drink order . we practically had to beg for refills and she wouldn 't even pick up our empty glasses and appetizer plates . we got up and walked out before our entrees came because of her shitty attitude .
0	absolute junk at spending $ 13 on a burger without anything extra and then two additional burgers for my son and my daughter i think it 's a joke to the guy would spend $ 35 at this place in have to drink water one out of five stars thank you
0	ordered eggs benedict ( $ 14 ) which is my fave . english muffin was raw . not even warmed . just raw and cold . excess water from poorly poached eggs only made it worse . hollandaise had zero flavor . potatoes were ice cold . for some reason they also gave me under cooked bacon ( which i didnt order ) . in fact they gave some to everyone whether they ordered it or not . wont say much about the service . it was adequete but odd . it was a really bad experience and i wont be going back .
0	service was below standards why us it that everyone think they can cook soul food ! very untrue statement ! ! ! greens ... nasty potato salad .... too much mustard chicken ..... very bland beans and rice ... no taste yams ... horrible mac and cheese ... no taste short rib ... so so cornbread ... ok overall rating ..... poor ! ! ! miss me with this place . !
0	came here to try the wednesday happy hour after hearing it was a big deal . horrible food and very slow service , even though the place wasn 't packed . the only highlight were the sliders , which were actually pretty good . the shrimp were overseasoned but the real letdown were the oysters . i can understand why they only charge 65 cents an oyster , and now i wonder why anyone would pay that for them . the oysters were the worst i 've ever had : flavorless , dirty , no brine , not fresh , and poorly shucked . next time go to blue point : exponentially better food for a marginal cost more .
0	absolutely a horrible experience we waited to be seated for way longer then we were told and the staff was completely rude i recommend not going here for a better experience dinning
0	drinks made wrong . no offer to remake them . steaks served practically raw . arrogant response from management . offered sip of champagne in plastic flutes to make the disastrous meal experience better . don 't waste your time or money on this place . they won 't stay open much longer . go to sw next door for a well prepared meal and excellent customer service .
0	i was returning 2 floor mats . the wait there was over 30 minutes . there was only one station open . the rep was arguing with the customer for over 15 minutes . just one customer ! 15 minutes . the rep tried to call the supervisor . it took another 10 for the supervisor to come . no one would open another station to help out . absolutely ridiculous .
0	we are regulars at this applebees usually there nights after 9 or 10 o 'clock at least once a week . we often sit and have a few drinks with some appetizers . being that we are there so often we are usually served without any issues . they gave us a hard time and would not serve us any drinks ( everyone at the table was 21 , with proof ) needless to say . i will not be returning to this applebees and they have lost a good customer .
0	waited 5 minutes to even have a hostess come and greet us ... were finally seated and had to wait another ten minutes for a server to come to the table to ask about drinks . it was not busy whatsoever . i had time to change my pants in the bathroom . we left . shall not return , ever .
0	absolutely asinine i refuse to do business with these people i went there i had a $ 50 bill cash to pay and they refused to take it they have a policy against 50 + 100 what a business model this is a screwed up place i wouldn 't recommend it to anybody ! ! ! !
0	empty wine glass and forgotten entree . this place is an embarrassment . my party is done and i 'm here waiting for my dinner or at least a drink maybe an apology but nothing .
0	food was terrible . service was terrible . management is terrible . if i could give a negative rating , i most certainly would . this place , this owner / manager should get out of the business because they are overwhelmed and incompetent .
0	i have came here 5 times and it is time for my review . the hostesses at this location are always talking and do not acknowledge customers even where there is not a lot of people , they stand there with no direction . my fiancé and i get to our table the seat was covered in grease and pizza crust . i asked our hostes if i could get a towel to wipe it down and she replyed with " oh my god " and returned half way through our meal with a rag . our service was absolutely awful like always and waiter got our food order wrong twice . will not come back
0	the food is just bad , service is even worse ... the only good thing here is the price but it 's just not worth it . stay away from it at all costs ! ! ! ! !
0	he treated me very poorly when i spoke with him about our server ( who was wonderful ) . he accused me of taking a bribe from the server to give him a compliment . i 'm highly disappointed .
0	bread was dry and stale like it was cut hours ago and the air killed it . meat was dry , over cooked , flavorless . sides were standard buffet average . service was average . line was long but it was dinner time . desserts were decent , i probably liked the cheesecake the best . total waste of $ 40 ! ! probably will never be back . such a shame because years ago i had an amazing brunch here . obviously they have totally fallen off over the last few years . lowlight of my vacation so far .
0	our family goes to this location once a week and always orders the same thing . long story short , our server was beyond horrible with the worst attitude and informed our table she was a server not a servant . i could go on and on about the rude remarks she made to our table . management handled extremely poorly all over a child being over 10 who wasn 't very hungry and wanted the kids chicken fingers . what happened to making your customers happy and since when do servers pick arguments with customers ?
0	i 've been before and been fine but this time i got the grilled chicken with arugula , tomatoes , onion , and pesto and ended up getting the worst food poisoning of my life . not only was i vomiting all night long but i was so physically ill i had to go get an iv at the local clinic where i proceeded to need to crawl to the bathroom . never have i ever been as ill from food before in my life and i have spent multiple weeks in third world countries . do not go .
0	server was not attentive at all , food took an hour to come out and was completely disgusting ! i got a salad and it was gross , ugh what a horrible waste of money . the scenery was beautiful but the restaurant is in desperate need of fixing up and so are the staff and chef ! mind you this was on a wednesday afternoon , not busy at all . please don 't waste the money you will be disappointed ! they said they would call the manager and he never even came out .
0	i ordered calamari , mozzarella sticks , wings with fries , zeppolis and a cannoli . portions were so minimal especially the calamari . the food was cold and disgusting . not fresh at all . everything tasted like it was heated in a microwave . chewy and gross ! took an hour and a half to receive ... wouldn 't doubt if the driver was snacking based on the tiny portions we received .
0	granted , we never actually got to eat anything because both times we went ( months apart ) we were seated and then ignored forever and ended up leaving .
0	i can 't tell which was worse ... the hour long wait for our food or the excruciating pain that was inflicted once the food poisoning set in . never mind , i 'm pretty sure curled up in the fetal position with agonizing pain was the winner . i will never eat here again . i am deeply saddened . i use to love eating at jimmy john 's .
0	i don 't normally do this , but the meat was so bad that i felt compelled to write a review . for the money they charge , you 'd expect the best steak you 've ever had , but not only were the steaks no good , they were bad . the striploin was either aged too long , or had begun to turn . very dry , tough and the fat tasted gamey . in fairness , i have purchased from them three times , and the fist time was excellent . however the last two times major disappointment .
0	i 've gone here three times and each of those times they have forgotten something out of my order . the last time i went they literally forgot my whole order and i was sitting in the front where they ask me to pull around to for 30 minutes . the never give me my receipt and it 's really ridiculous to pay $ 60 for a dinner for my husband and three kids on the only day i have off and have one or multiple things missing . i order dinner last night and two of my sides were missing and what is sad is i expected that as soon as i got home . this store is so bad .
0	while they provide decent sized coffee mugs , the content is subpar . the omelette i had was over cooked and a horribly gloppy thick sauce was spread over the top . my friends ' pancakes were laden with baking powder and had no flavor . the entire place smells of smoke and , while the people watching was awesome , you can do that anywhere in vegas . our server was attentive , but the food was just abysmal . almost everyone felt slightly ill after eating . i would recommend staying away .
0	wouldn 't take the coupon they mailed to us that didn 't expire until december ( only reason we decided to go ) and the food was cold , small portions & threw our nachos into a pizza box and must have forgot the toppings because our nacho order were all chips and a sliver of beef soaking through the box to our cars interior ( why was this on the side of the pizza box n not on the chip at least ? ? ) . in addition , their caesar salad was soggy to top off their " food quality n business etiquette ... " last statement so i don 't drag on ... avoid this place !
0	apocalyptically slow service and laughably small portions . avoid at all costs go to moes or starbucks
0	my mom and i just went for a late night dinner and no one came to our table . the place was empty so i thought maybe you had to dine at the bar . i asked the bartender if we order with her and she said , " oh yeah i can take your order , i see you " then when she came she rudely asked if we wanted something to drink and when she brought our waters she walked away immediately . there was no one in there . horrible . i suggest the owner reevaluates his staff because i work in the restaurant industry and i can understand certain situations but jeez that service was the worst . lol comical .
0	absolutely awful service ... ok food ... had to wait an hour after our reservation to finally be seated then had to ask for bread and to place an order ... after all that they did not offer to comp anything ... will not be back
0	the place was not even crowded and they still took waaaay too long to get us our order . definitely not worth the super long wait for mediocre pizza . also , i got food poisoning from the one slice i ate . apparently washing their hands is not a requirement . just go to pizza rock down the street . it 's a much better and safer option .
0	we have been here many times before and it had always been an enjoyable experience , but this morning was just so awful . our server was slow and unsure of every little thing . getting drinks took far too long , food orders were incorrect or forgotten entirely , at no point in our meal did our server ask how things were or check on us . i will not frequent this establishment in the future nor will i recommend this cafe to to anyone else . completely dissatisfied .
0	waited in line for 15 minutes before we ended up leaving and going to mcdonalds across the street . slowest wendy 's ever .
0	the food takes an hour while the other half of the table is enjoying their meal . the servers look like they have been through hell and back and hate life . our server talked to us like we were high schoolers at a waffle house at 3 am . meanwhile i 've been in the industry for over 7 years and i have never left a 10 % tip in my life except for here . the server forgot to ring in my food and then started to get an attitude and roll her eyes at me , while i was being extremely polite and understanding . this place has a lot to work on and i 'm very unimpressed .
0	took forever to get food , food then came out cold , we asked the manager to fix tv 3 times and it never got fix ! the place was dead and it was still slower than molasses .
0	worst service i have had in a very long time . breakfast took at least 45 minutes and it was not worth the wait . i just had a simple bacon and eggs , both that were undercooked . i was given two whole potatoes instead of home fries and order chicken sausage that was really salty . my husband had a benedict that arrived without hollandaise . the patio is nice but would not return .
0	i went thru the drive thru and ordered , asked them to repeat it back to me . asked again at the window , they told me correctly . got home , all of it was wrong . burger looked like it was sat on .... done giving them a try .
0	drenched in heavy amount of oil , very expensive , not worth it , as for the rest of the menu no different still crap ! highly not recommend .
0	absolutely crap food and the manager was not helpful at all ... failing to exchange the uncooked food saying you already had part of your meal after we tasted it .
0	i ordered a box combo with no coleslaw and asked for extra fries . what i received was a box combo with coleslaw dripping throughout the box . not only did i ask for extra ketchup but when i got my ketchup they gave me one packet . i understand times are rough but what the fuck . one packet of ketchup for my fries and chicken ? the chicken and fries were pretty good tho .
0	never ordered from them before . while they were very expeditious in delivering , the sandwich was terrible . brown shredded lettuce all over my tuna sandwich so it was mixed into the tuna . can 't believe they had the audacity to use such poor quality produce . would not recommend . firehouse subs port of subs much better , unfortunately they don 't deliver .
0	service was horrible . food was meh . for the kind of money they charge ( $ 20 for a hot dog ) , you should go to a restaurant that wants to serve you and are glad you are there . never again .
0	i heard good things but in reality it was very poor . they must have been short staffed . the bar had at least 6 tables that were un-bused , the service in the bar was rude and slow. it took almost 30 minutes to get a drink , which we finally decided to leave . at the price point they are charging , it should have been a much better experience . the management should figure out what it wants to be . a destination or closed .
0	my wife and i sat at the counter for breakfast last week . at one point an older guy who was bussing and refilling ice came out with two ice buckets . his right thumb was covered in blood . so much it was dripping on the floor . i said " hey bud , your hand is bleeding ! " he shrugged his shoulders motioned towards the kitchen and went back to filling ice . he left a huge smear of blood on the bottom of an ice bucket and then stacked it inside the first one ! at this point blood was on the floor , in the ice , in the ice buckets , and on everything he touched and no one cared !
0	after waiting in the drive thru for over 15 minutes with only one car ahead of me i assumed they must have been making something fresh . boy was i wrong ! ! the chicken was soggy and slimy . i couldn 't eat it . so i went to continue on to my mac n cheese and mashed potatoes ... no utensils ! i got 15 napkins , 9 packets of hot sauce and 11 packets of honey sauce ( actual count ) but no utensils ! just go ahead and close this location already !
0	the bacon on the burger was nearly raw . the flavor was bad . the split pea and ham soup was gross . ended up throwing the food away , after wasting $ 20 . yuck !
0	the flavor was bad . the chili was gross . ended up throwing the food away , after wasting $ 20 . the guy with cane is rude , i do not recommend this carter save your money , yuck !
0	and i got sick .. horrible half ass cooked brought me out raw potatoes that were hard , burned ham and burned my pancake . how do you burn a pancake ? ? ? wtf ? ? poor owner is gonna end up losing this place due to his cook . service was good though but horrible cook . oh and my girls chips were hard and old . never again will i eat there .
0	arrived at 12 : 30 pm for lunch today . apparently the salad bar had been left uncovered since dinner last night . lettuce was wilted and getting slimy . tomatoes and cucumbers were frozen solid . hummus and potato salad were covered with dry brown crusts . half the other ingredients were almost used up . staff made no effort to restock or clean up the salad bar . with so many ruby tuesday 's closing the staff must want to join the unemployed .
0	rolls were hard as rocks coleslaw sucked what happened to kfc ? used to be the best
0	every so called ' food ' item looked like it had been sitting there for 10 hours , and based on how i feel right now , i think it might have been 20 . avoid this place . avoid this place . avoid this place .
0	even the salads were watery and bland . how are they still in business ?
0	food was undercooked to the point of being cold , wet , soggy . i had to re-cook everything when i got home to make sure i didn 't get sick . got about 1 / 4 of the items i ordered , which took 1 hour of waiting . paid for $ 40 worth of food , got about $ 20 . completely left out some items , gave me others out of carelessness . if i could give lower than 1 star , i would . this location is a terrible popeyes .
0	absolutely disgusting health practices ... everyone i know has gotten horribly ill from eating here never coming back .... i tried it after hearing it was reasonably priced ... what price do you put on throwing up the next morning ? horrendous i wouldn 't feed my dog that garbage ....
0	i attempted to eat their signature chili cheeseburger and barely made it halfway through . i am morbidly obese and typically eat anything that is in front of me . i felt obligated to eat as much as i did just because it was so damn expensive . the cheese was generic processed kraft singles . the chili . ugh , the chili . its not even really chili . it tastes like dehydrated astronaut food . its texture is horribly chalky tasting . this was seriously the most foul tasting food i 've ever had in my life . though , comparing it to real human food is being much too polite . i would give this zero stars given the opportunity .
0	i came here around 7pm on a tuesday night with my daughter and the place was slow and it was trashed . i told the manager politely to just to bring it to her attention and it took her about 20 minutes to get someone to tidy the place up . there was pop sprayed all over the floor by the registers so bad that my feet were sticking to the ground .. the sauce dispensers had hardened sauce all over them and sauce all over the counter . i love arby 's and will not be returning back just because the poor costumer service and professionalism .
0	when i called , the young girl who answered made it seem as if it was my own problem that i found the hair . horrible service with horrible food i 'm severely disappointed .
0	if you purchased the groupon , i would get a refund . we went for lunch and were less than underwhelmed with the salad bar . the food they brought to you for the seafood potion was ( in a word ) inedible . run , do not walk away from this very low end restaurant in vegas . i would be surprised if it stayed open much longer .
0	i had the country skillet as recommended by the server . it came drowned in 8 gallons of yellow sauce and had absolutely zero taste . i sent it back and ordered the protein breakfast with sausage and bacon and ham . well .. bacon was burned on some pieces and raw in others . the ham was burned as well . what a disaster going there . this was the downtown oakville location . definitely avoid this place .
0	i have been in this business for 15 + years and have never seen such a pathetic example of team work . all 3 of you just sat there talking about how proud u where to not be white and making complete jokes of yourself . funny thing is the only person working in the whole damn place was an older white gentlemen named steve . steve you where amazing and deserve a better job and team then the crap i witnessed . i will never step foot in this shit whole again !
0	i really do not understand what all the excitement is about . for 20 bucks i got 2 small greasy burgers and 2 orders of fries with a bunch of crap all over them . i walked out feeling robbed of my wallet and my health .
0	absolutely disgusting it was dirty and gross the manager even came by our table but no one picked up the sausage that was next to our table the entire time we were there we watched person after person walk over the sausage some even stepping on it .
0	microwavable food . swindles you to pay for something that you didn 't order . false advertising . avoid at all costs !
0	not only is the restaurant dirty , the food is gross too . i got the beach salad and the avocado and lettuce in the salad had gone bad . the chicken looked questionable . i ordered a beer that was skunked . all this after a five hour delay .
0	not only was there a 6 " hair wound through both halves of my sandwich - the edge of the cheese had mold on it . it looked like a sandwich that your blind , senile , 90 year old grandma would try to serve you . gross and will never be back .
0	not sure how they are even open because when we went there at dinner time , no one else was there . we should have ran out the door when we had the chance . fish was dry and was clearly frozen . no flavor , rubber shrimp , gave me tilapia instead of flounder ( thought i wouldnt no the difference ) . the owner was incredibly rude , came to the table rolling their eyes giving us attitude . i will never go back here and everyone else should save yourself and stay away .
0	went there on a sunday at 2 pm , was told it 's 20 per person . eggs were powdered , sausages old and hard as rocks , bacon floating in grease , and way too much breakfast stuff , hardly any american lunch items . i demanded my money back after one taste of the eggs and sausage . what exactly are they charging extra for ? will never come back here . it was on par with sunset stations 's ' feast buffet ' and that 's an insult .
0	order a turkey burger took my first bite and a long hair with meat stuck on both sides . manager said sorry but we did not feel he really was sincere . we will never go back again . if i could give it no stars i would have . yuck .
0	ordered combo plate to go with falafel , kafka and lamb . lamb was tough and tasteless . falafel was overcooked and bone dry and tasted like yesterday 's fryer oil kafta ( formed ground beef with onion ) was raw in the middle when i cut it open . raw ground beef ! thank god i cut with a fork and didn 't just bite in . never again !
0	order friend calamari for an app . wow ! heavily battered and wayyyyy over cooked . my husband got the crab leg special ( 1 1 / 2lbs of king crab legs $ 28 ) they were over cooked , cold and extremely tough ! i ordered the seafood diavolo and it was also nasty ! over cooked shrimp and under cooked scallops . yuck . and in top of it all the service was horrible ! ! ! ! ! ! ! complained to our waiter and never came back .... just handed us the check with everything full priced . all we asked were to take off the crab legs . what a joke ! ! ! ! never again ! stay away ! !
0	our meal ended abruptly when an enormous cockroach ran out from under our table . the manager grabbed a vacuum and acted like she was vacuuming as normal . when i made her aware that we saw the cockroach and that we had lost our appetites , her response was that " that sort of thing just happens , you know ? you should still pay for your meal . " apparently , i don 't know because i don 't remember ever having a cockroach run out from under my table and i would never consider that business as usual . never again pier 51 ! ! !
0	i went to the nellis location. i truly believe the only reason they are still open is cuz its located inside a bar and drunk people will eat anything and think it 's good .
0	pizza was cold ( pick up ) . cheesy sticks were cold and terrible . i would avoid this particular location at all costs .
0	the managers are rude ! and not accommodating whatsoever ! in such an economy they should not be treating ppl who spend money like this ! especially st this location ! seriously disgusted !
0	terrible food and awful service . also in a very bad area . i had an awful experience and i wouldn 't recommend you go here . there are much better places for much cheaper that actually value their customers .
0	the salads were so soaked with some kind of sour dressing that i had to pour it on another plate . the feta cheese tasted as though it had been soaked in something other then it 's natural brine . just frigging gross to even look at . i left feeling ill .
0	we drove up to pick up dinner and three employees , in uniform , were all sitting in the parking lot smoking cigarettes . they looked at us super guiltily and put out their cigarettes and rushed inside . so sketchy ! at that point we were too grossed out to go inside and have them touching and preparing all our food . we will not be coming to this location again .
0	we paid for our drinks and left . 92.5 sanitation score says it all ....
0	would never go back , food terrible , service rude , can 't imagine there are enough tourists to keep this place open for much longer . stay far far away ! !
0	we went with my husbands parents for breakfast , and his dad ordered a breakfast burrito , halfway thru it he found half a roach ! ! ! ! we called the manager over and showed the manager , he just looked at it and said " oh it happens ... " we left right away and took a pic of the roach in the food , sent it to the health department , and they told us they had many reports against them .
0	had the pork and got violently ill about an hour after . tasted ok but worst food poisoning ever . i will never go back - and advise everyone to stay away . far away .
0	such a joke ! long story short ordered delivery 5 phone calls talked to 4 different people including the manager over an hour later i finally canceled my order and they had a since of relief in there voice when i did instead of trying everything to get my food delivered ! expected so much more form this food chain !
0	absolutely dreadful ... cold , overpriced food ... terrible service ... the desert bar was lacking ... they nailed the pita bread and mashed potatoes but i have little else positive to say about the place .
0	i ordered the " mi amor burger " with fries . the burger was clearly a factory-made patty . it was cooked to death . the " molten brie " was only partially melted . the fries were lukewarm , and so was the burger . the entire thing tasted like nothing at all . are you guys aware of salt and pepper ? it took 25 minutes to appear in a half-empty bar and it was $ 21 . it 's very difficult to understand how a hotel restaurant with hundreds of covers every day could fuck up a cheeseburger so badly . i would rather starve than eat at this shithole again .
0	absolutely dreadful service , we never got our food at the grab and go section after 35 mins and no one barely in the kitchen , they hadn 't even started our order so we demanded our money back .... if i could put a massive zero on this i would !
0	waited in line for an hour thinking it would be over the top yum . instead it was gross plus we had to wait another 30 minutes after ordering to get out food which was cold and disappointing and missing key ingredients . don 't order the chicken burger unless you like ground chicken ? weird . the fries were decent but we won 't be going back .
0	waiting on hold to make a reservation at 2pm on a tuesday for over 39 minutes . i was able to walk to the restaurant before i got off hold . when i arrived at the hostess stand , no one was there for over 10 minutes . i took initiative and sat at an open table and my whole party was kicked out immediately . this place is an embarrassment to las vegas and should be removed immediately .
0	the salad was bland and the dressing was disgusting and came in a pouch . the croutons were stale while others were chewy . and the chicken was terrible and there was barely any in the salad . my boyfriend got the philly cheese steak sandwich and he strongly disliked it . it was extremely bland . and the onions on it tasted like they were on the verge of spoiling . never eat here . if i could give this place zero stars , then i would !
0	not cool d & d. i 'm an avid customer who went out of his way to find this place only to have a shitty start to his day . don 't plan on ever coming back to a d & d. peace !
0	they make up in novelty & size for the lack of taste . scrambled eggs are slimy , " hash " potatoes are unseasoned fried potatoes , or what most people know as " home fries . " no jam for toast , poor quality bacon .
0	at least 8 massive cobwebs with massive spiders greet you on the way in . i happen to not notice when i ordered . i can 't believe this place is still in business . total disbelief . poutineries was super salty .... go elsewhere ! ! !
0	changed all the booth seating to tables . now you get the privilege of watching everyone chew their food . floors and tables were dirty . didn 't even stay to eat . had to leave .
0	i honestly cannot believe people come back after eating here . worse than little caesars .
0	drove 25 minutes to get some old dry chicken , soft waffles , mac & cheese mush and liquid diabetes kool aid . i ordered and my food was out in 3 minutes . it takes longer to get chicken at a kfc drive thru , clearly the food was heated up and not fresh . it wasn 't busy either so i 'm not too sure why they slacked . they get one star cause well i have to give one to comment but i will say the restaurant isn 't ghetto it 's actually pretty nice and in a good area , and the host was genuinely nice and welcoming !
0	always feels dirty and the food always leaves me disappointed . last trip my fries were just stale and unappealing .
0	we sat for half an hour before we were asked what we wanted and then when i asked her what was on tap she rudely said " you actually want me to read off what we have " avoid this place if you can .
0	my friend said his burger was the driest burger he 's ever had . i had a patty melt which was absolutely disgusting . there was barely any meat on it . i was hungry two hours later . i wouldn 't go back there if they paid me to eat there .
0	our waitress was absolutely unavailable during our visit and the restaurant was empty so their was no excuse . i did see our waitress socializing with her co workers instead of waiting tables . as for the food i had the pulled pork sandwich and it was incredibly dry , unfortunately i was hungry so i finished it instead of complaining . on top of the horrendous food , our waitress clearly didn 't understand the order of how a meal is suppose to be she instead served the entrees before the appetizers which for another words shows a lack of training at this restaurant .
0	i love wing zone but this location needs new management and staff immediately !
0	asked for medium cooked prime rib . tasted like they cooked it in the crock pot . lobster mac and cheese was ice cold . lobster tasted like rubber . even the soda tasted bad . will never be back .
0	the service is okay but microwaving some bacon , canned beans and breakfast sausage at home would have been better and not cost me 15 dollars .
0	burnt doughy disaster greasy and not even close to what we ordered and more than half straight to the garbage . never will i order food from pizza pit again . i would give negative stars to this ripoff if i could .
0	asked to speak to the manager , who couldn 't be bothered with a customer order , she just didn 't care . the manager needs some serious retraining .
0	i called in a to-go order and was told 15-20min . it 's been over 30min and i 'm still waiting on 20 wings ! ! ! ! i will never come here again ! ! ! ! not even worth the one star i gave them !
0	our server asked if we like the soup , when we said no , she removed our plates without a word , not a question , nothing . no water for 15 min . enchiladas at an american steak house ? 4 steaks at a steak house ? i know it 's corporate , but give us paying customers some decent quality food for the 27 dollar dishes . don 't go , save your money head to long horn on alma school .
0	the service is slow and rude . the place wasn 't even that busy and we waited an 1.5 hours for food while other tables that came in after us were served ahead of us . peaked into kitchen out on my way out of bathroom -- nasty . there 's gotta be some health code violations . our food was cold and flavorless . simply put : horrible . do not go here !
0	do not come here ! literally three tables sat including our family of four . four servers on shift ( i counted ) and it still took twenty minutes before anyone came to the table , another twenty minutes for drinks , took an hour to get our food and when we finally did it was all cold . server did not check on us at all and we were constantly having to flag her down from behind the waitress station or wherever she disappeared to . literally dead in this place and the service couldn 't be worse . if i could give it zero stars , i would . will never , ever come back and i recommend no one else come here either !
0	pick up a starbucks next door and keep moving .
0	don 't do it ! my girlfriend and her family went to this location got horribly sick . i forgot she told me got a gift card for christmas came to location and the lettuces were wilted and my girlfriend was nauseous throwing up and horribly sick yet again ! this location needs to be closed down !
0	i 'm in vegas by myself this weekend and wanted to come have a great lunch . the hostess staff were horrible . they asked if i wanted inside or out . i said i would like inside . first trek they took me outside , i asked to come back inside then they placed me at a little bistro table so small it wouldn 't have even held a salad plate and it was right next to the place where the staff had to pick up plates and silverware . screw you mon ami gabi . just because i don 't have a group of 10 doesn 't me i 'm a nobody
0	first off waited at the host stand for several minutes before being acknowledged staff was too busy talking amongst themselves to notice us standing there . the only good thing about our experience was our server . ordered a steak cooked medium took 3 times of recooking it for it too come close to being right . restaurant looked dirty and the bathrooms were awful . will never be back at this location .
0	from the rude , inattentive waitress ( becky ) to the bad food to the missing soup . do not recommend . will never return . i 'm not even going to go into detail on how bad the food was . just avoid this place at all cost .
0	left before we were even seated . hostess had customer service skills that would be better suited toward a truck stop than a supposable 5 star destination on the las vegas strip . rude , rolled her eyes , made derogatory remarks about members of our party . completely mind blowing to say the least . it 's obvious she didn 't earn the position based on her level of hospitality . let me be the one to break it to you ... your a hostess not a kardashian learn to treat your guests with respect . caesars should be ashamed that this is the quality of employee they choose to represent their brand . terribly disappointed all around .
0	no drink refills . wrong food delivered once it finally showed up . no idea who our server was . the one that took our order went home . the one that delivered our food never came back . overall unhappy .
0	the service was better at mc donalds and the food was disgusting . would not recommend this place to my worst enemy .
0	the food took forever and when it came it was over cooked and not that great . although they were busy , the staff did not work with a sense of urgency . i hate leaving bad reviews , but i thought it was a practical joke being played on my family and myself . i work in customer service industry and the customer service was horrible . i did however still leave the waitress a tip . she can only work as fast as her coworkers . i will not be returning anytime soon .
0	we were excited to try this new breakfast spot , and we didn 't mind the 60 + minute wait . the problems started when they took our name off the wait list ( before we were seated ) , causing the wait to be much longer . no apology . the food was mediocre- particularly the congealed gravy on the breakfast pot pie . our drinks were never refilled , no manager ever touched our table . terrible service and food . we will not be returning . thanks for ruining our valentine 's day brunch .
0	first , took a while to get seated even though there were barely any people . second , the waitress wasn 't very nice and helpful . third , the water tasted awful- like it wasn 't filtered . fourth , the food quality was very poor and not warm at all & no eating utensils were given . and lastly , the service was very slow . i waited for a salad for 30 minutes ! overall , it was the worst service & food i 've ever had .
0	no flavor . took over an hour for the food to get there . waiter was perfect and he felt bad got us the manager and she comp. our food and our drinks but we had to kinda make a big deal bc she didn 't want to comp anything at all . she wanted us to get something else but i didn 't want to wait another hour for food . she then gave us 2 complementary dinners for our next time there . but i won 't be going back any time soon ... i have never complained to a manager in my life so this is a big deal for me .
0	this casino is really nice but definitely skip this restaurant . all four of us were disappointed with our food . i ordered the " ultimate " grilled cheese and it was pathetic . it was rock hard bread with unmelted cheese . terrible .
0	my girlfriend got a philly pita , not hot at all and no veggies in it ! my daughter kids meal was probably the best but still not hot , this place can 't get out hot and fresh if i could do 0 starts i would , this place needs new management and a new chef
0	having just been redone , we were excited to try again . we did call ahead seating and was told 40-45 minutes . 90 minutes later and multiple check-ins with the hostess , we had yet to be seated . i was confused because there were multiple tables that were not bussed for 20 + minutes . to make it worse , people surrounding us had been receiving cold food and sending it back all night . we ended up leaving and i do not plan on returning . good thing we have a longhorn steakhouse and texas roadhouse coming to make up for this institution .
0	i don 't understand how anyone likes these burgers or fries . i got a single combo . i wanted to upgrade to cheese fries , but i was told i had to purchase all separately to get cheese fries . ok ? ? ? i just added on a side of cheese . i 'm pretty sure they just ran across the street to burger king because it tasted just like their burgers . thin meat , oversized bun . fries were soggy and over salted . i was excited to try this little burger joint as i live to support little food joints like this . however , i was very disappointed . will not return .
0	i had breakfast there a couple of weeks ago and all the food was undercooked . and the owner looks like a fraud . do not come here . it 's absolutely horrible there .
0	i hate myself for going there . went to the drive through . asked for a kids cheeseburger meal . was literally yelled at that they are called happy meals . complete my order . sit there for a couple minutes and ask , should i pull around ? i am told , " yeah go ahead . " i hand the guy my money and then he asks me what i ordered . this is the absolute worst mcdonald 's i have ever been to in my life . every single time i go there because it is convenient , i hate myself a little more never again !
0	i miss the old brat and brau ! freezer burn flavor burger and broken broccoli cheese soup were not worth the money . and the manager needs to go to class learning about customer service . not going back !
0	i 'm no picky eater but i literally ate nothing beside there anti para salads . i was really disappointed with everything . the potatos au gratin were not even cooked ! ! ! i only tasted a few desserts and decided to eat dinner else where . thank god the casino comped this other wise i would have been pissed . if your looking for a good quality low price buffer , . , it doesn 't really exist in vegas anymore . you get what you pay for i guess .
0	in no particular order - - waited for 40 minutes for salads while restaurant was very slow - wedge salad was a chopped salad - waiter filled wine glass to rim and did not offer a tasting prior - signature 3 finger pork chop was very bland for 48 hours of marinating - signature prime rib was gray and very bland - service was extremely slow and impersonal based on their website you 'd believe you are going to a 4 star restaurant to " indulge " - don 't be fooled . i 'd suggest one of the other chain restaurants by concord mills .
0	i ordered the chicken sandwich and oh my goodness i should have taken a photo ! first of all the sandwich buns were absolutely drenched in butter and oil ! my bun literally dripped oil ! second it wasn 't even a chicken breast like all the other normal places you would order a chicken sandwich from . it was 3 sorry looking limp burned chicken tenders put on the sandwich ! ! really ? i couldn 't even eat it because it was so greasy and the chicken tenders were dried out and when you would bite into them nothing would happen because they were so dried out that all the chicken stuck together ! ! definitely skip this place .
0	i walked in there for lunch . no one was there . empty ! ! ! ordered a burger . it took them 30 mins to make my pathetic excuse for a meal . mind you the guy who took my order checked on me to " refresh " his memory on what i ordered . seriously . not a damn person in the store . finally got my food . all bun and condiment with a baby burnt patty ! ! terrible . if i could rate them negative i would ! ! !
0	do yourself a favor and go anywhere else ! ! !
0	the people here advertised plenty of seating for the world cup games only to turn away people who arrived more than an hour and a half before the game . they delete negative comments on their facebook page to save face but the truth is they have an uncoordinated front of house staff . they advised people to go somewhere else but ended up having tables ten minutes before the games started . their explanation was that they couldn 't do anything and had no idea how to seat anyone . avoid this place because of the management !
0	absolutely horrible may as well eat there vegan options because the meat portions are laughable spent 40 plus dollars on a plate of chips and beans a steak sandwich with less steak than subway and recieved horrible service even though we were one of 4 tables i the entire restaurant
0	my husband and i were trying genos for the first time and when we walked in , there were signs all over the sodas that said " out of order " so i thought oh maybe i just should drink soda today . we placed our order-2 cheesesteaks and we sat down to watch the march madness action . we were quickly told they were out of steak and they asked if we wanted chicken . no dude , it 's a cheesesteak . the people working were young kids who couldn 't have cared less . we got our money back and are heading to another place . do not go there , you 'll waste your time !
0	one person working , doesn 't acknowledge you until literally 10 minutes later myself and a buddy waited 20 minutes for a pre cooked slice of pizza and a hotdog . fries , pizza and hotdog were awful ! do not waste your time or money at this place ! ! ! cruddy food cruddy service !
0	paid $ 23 for a party size pizza . basic pizza is just sauce and cheese . each extra topping is $ 2 extra and as you can see in the picture they did a half-assed job of dressing the pizza - the centre wasn 't even covered and the bottom right was only partially covered . the ingredients used are substandard . the crust was puffy like sandwich bread and the cheese was gross and gummy . felt sick all night after eating this garbage .
0	first the parking was way too tight . the service was terrible . the appetizer was brought out with the food and our food was cold . we requested the manager and she was a complete b * * ch. she was racist towards me and my family because we are not caucasian . the servers were racist as well on a count of we were the only table receiving bad service . i 'm never coming back here again .
0	we were sat relatively quickly at a corner table . the restaurant was barely half full . we were never offered water and the server never came over . we waited for 10 minutes and promptly walked out . there 's way too many good restaurants in vegas than to be waiting and be ignored .
0	we placed a home delivery order and waited ... and waited . called to inquire and we 're told we had been called and we were out of the delivery range . we were not called ! they had called a different number . we asked to complete our order , since it had been almost 2 hours , she refused to comp anything and said , again , they had called us ! ! jessica was rude and refused to admit they had made a mistake ! she has no business being in the hospitality business ! what a jerk .....
0	service bad , food worse , stay away ! one of worst restaurants have ever been to in cleveland . mothers day brunch - epic fail !
0	we walked up to the door and had to ask the hostess to be seated . he response was " i have no tables , " so i asked , if they had any open seats at the bar and she said " nope ! " then turned around and walked away . won 't ever be back .. if that is the service from the first person you see when you walk in , i can only imagine what the service is like inside .
0	over an hour , did not even get all our food had to split food so everyone could eat . asked for manager and one never came
0	i live close by and have tried it twice . last time i walked out since they had plenty of servers standing around and nobody took my order 20min into sitting there .
0	it always takes 5-10 minutes to get a drink order in . doesn 't matter busy or nobody here . food isn 't bad but service is horrible .
0	my friend and i sat for 20 minutes and weren 't even given water . the restaurant was not busy . the waitstaff was in huddles talking with one another and seemed to have no interest in helping patrons . when we finally left , they didn 't even ask why we were leaving . they just said bye . we won 't return . martorano 's is a much better option if you 're looking for fabulous service and i great atmosphere .
0	the waitresses need to brush up on their knowledge of drinks ( you work in las vegas for god 's sake ) and work on their people skills . rolling your eyes and attitude will get you no where in life .
0	they don 't even answer their phones . they don 't receive online orders , and when you go into the shop , they are nasty . worst service i have ever received in las vegas . don 't bother with these dirt bags .
0	they lost our name on the waiting list , and didn 't seat us until out party of 4 had waited 40 minutes and asked the hostess . our waitress was sarcastic , rude and horribly slow . food was ok , my eggs were cold , and the portions are too big . they should be donating their extras to a homeless shelter or something ... what should have been a meal that lasted about an hour ended up lasting 2.5 hours because service was so poor
0	they not only charged us for waters ( the same price as a soda ) without mentioning it to is when we ordered , but after we paid we realized they charged us for an extra cone . when we realized our bill was off the cashier told us too bad and didn 't offer any solutions .
0	and i might mention that it 's not even a busy night ...... if was this franchise owner i would be furious and fire everyone in the restaurant . even overheard a waitress yell out that she needed a cigarette ...... i waited longer to eat here than i did waiting in line at disney world .
0	waited 25 minutes for a simple salad . the lettuce in my salad was not properly washed . many upset customers , and staff did not seem to care about the complaints ( wait time , wrong orders after they repeated their orders several times , bad service ) . will not be returning again . thoroughly disappointed .
0	waited 45 minutes to get our drinks , and then 1 min later our dinner arrived . the food was very mediocre , at best . definitely not worth the extremely high price for this restaurant .
0	we got seated after a couple minutes then we waited for 15 minutes , nobody came and asked for a drink order . i finally asked for a manager , she came out . i explained what was going on , no im sorry , i got " i 'll get someone . " so i go back and sat down , 3 minutes later , still nobody . we get up and walk out . the manager looked so confused . as we were walking out she passed and said " i was gonna ...... " and we continued walking . absolutely ridiculous . we will not be back ! !
0	went there with a group of 13 , we were seated upstairs in a semi private area which was nice . though this was going to be a great place but then the service began or i should say lack of . the waitress was rude , didn 't bring the items we asked for , restaurant was out of beer on tap and specials of the night , waitress didn 't smile once ! forgot our order , gave us appetizer with main meal and ignored us as much as possible . i have never left without tipping until this night . i will never return !
0	went to the drive thru and it took forever for the food to be ready , considering this is " fast food . " also , i ask for extra sauce and napkins and i only get one sauce and no napkins . after eating my chicken , i wake up a few hours later at 2am and find myself vomiting and sick to the stomach . i was forced to miss school and had to spend the day in the hospital for " severe food poisoning . " this chicken brand used to be good but now it 's only ever deteriorating with the brand focusing more on its image than its service. smh 0 / 10
0	went with my girl to get some food because we were starving and we waited at the drive in for about 20 minutes clicking the button over and over again and no one would attend us so we decided to go through the drive through and it took someone 5 minutes to attend us and while we were ordering the person taking our order wasn 't responding and we sat there for another 3-5 minutes so er decided to leave . you guys need to work on your customer service . never coming back .
0	we were seated for over 10 minutes and never had a server come to even take drink orders . needless to say we left , and we will not be going back .
0	one and a half hours for delivery pizza was cold delivery guy had his boxers hanging out in his pants sagging around his waist customer service is crap and i will never order food from them again don 't waste your money because it is horrible ! ! !
0	slow service , burnt , greasy limp french fries and burnt pre-cooked pizza .
0	terrible food and worse. service . overpriced and under-managed . don 't waste your time . i had high hopes which made the disappointment even harder to stomach . i will never return .
0	terrible service and disgusting burger . i 'm not a crazy foodie or anything , but this place just sucked . don 't get any of the burgers if you 're forced to come here .
0	the worst farmers boys i gotten food from . the burger patties tasted like they had been sitting all day . the chicken strips were hard as rock and dry as cardboard . save your money and don 't visit this farmer boys ... absolutely horrible ! ! ! '
0	they don 't even try to make sure what their serving good ! same as service .
0	they were nice when i picked my order up ... that 's it . the veggie pizza was soggy as hell ... must have used frozen vegetables ! the caesar 's salad had like a mayonnaise-type dressing ... i kid you not , not even close to what it should taste like . the dessert , homemade zeppoles , tasted like straight oil . i mean ... how can you f up fried dough ? ! this i paid $ 31 and change ... after tip it was $ 36.00 . needless to say ... i shan 't be back ! ! !
0	took 18 minutes for 2 slices of pizza , and not one person came to tell me it 's going to be a while . i had an appointment and took it to go . then , both slices fell apart as soon as i put it in the box . there 's more grease in my box then in my coconut oil jar at home . on top of that , the pizza was mediocre , at best . thought i would come in and get a quick bite and ... nope ! time guzzler here . don 't waste your money , especially time here !
0	absolutely horrible ..... took over an hour for sandwiches .... one sandwich came out raw , came out at different times , absolutely horrible
0	way over priced for what you get . my wife is a very healthy eater and we found this on yelp . the food was under cooked as well . their baked fries tasted ok but weren 't even cooked all the way through . a friend of ours bought a side salad that was the size of her hand . we 'll never go back and will never refer anyone there .
0	what happened to arby 's ? i used to love their food but every time i come here it 's less than desirable . curly fries are cold and just don 't taste good anymore . i tried their smoke mountain sandwich combo and for almost $ 13 you get crappy cold fries , a flat , mashed sandwich with nasty onion fries and bork belly that 's 90 % fat . the soda was ok . what a disappointment ! not coming back again , ever !
0	worked there for about two weeks shortly after they had opened , they refused to pay us servers saying we were working for tips until they got the computer system payroll up and running ( lies ) , food was thrown together with no thought behind it , very low quality food , don 't have half of the things they have on their menu ready to order .. beautiful location and decor but horrible management , horrible , beware of mentor , ohio 's maraca 's ! ! !
0	my fiance and i ordered online , picked up the order . they read off the order to him when he went to pick it up and everything sounded great . he got all the way home for us to find out they gave us the completely wrong order . he drove all the way back to get the correct order and they forgot almost half of our sauces . overall , i 'll be back because sometimes i get chick-fil-a cravings but dear lord do i resent the heck out of this place . i know you guys are busy , but i 've worked in the fast food industry before and it 's not that hard . get it together .
0	i ordered a fresh squeezed o.j. it had a brownish tinge ( ugh ) i tasted it anyway , hoping they had used some blood oranges . nope . disgusting . definitely not fresh squeezed . threw it away . avoid at all costs
0	uber thin burger that tastes like liver with plastic cheese topping . french fries were ok , but small on portion .
0	i was so disappointed . pancakes were dry , coffees were cold . i was hungry when i left . then waitress are oblivious and barely checked on us . she had no reaction to giving us out check with 2 full plates of food .
0	it is surprising to me that an mgm owned casino can have such a crappy buffet . i guess that after having the wynn 's and bellagio 's buffet before has made my palette more demanding ? the food was either too dry , too salty , too greasy or not fresh . i had to literally stop after half a plate of food and just went to the salad bar to make a caesar salad for myself . luckily for me , i had a $ 75 food comp for myself and some family so all we had to shell out was a few bucks . this is the first and definitely the last time i will visit this buffet .
0	absolutely insulting treatment for their customers arrived at 9 : 00 am was told would be a 15 to 20 min wait 30 minutes later was told maybe 20 more minutes they could care less we left will never be back and will tell others about my experience
0	the manager is a punk ass who thinks it 's okay to be rude to his customers . from what i saw too , he was very lazy and got upset when someone else helped him out . please do not take this the wrong way , do come enjoy a meal here ! but just be wary of the manager .
0	wanted to have a nice lunch date with my husband ... but it was ruined when the actual servers sat in the booth next to us ( mind you the whole side of the restaurant we were on was empty and they sat next to us ) . they proceeded to complain about the tables they were serving ... how bad their tips were ... etc. loved that the manager actually joined in and sat at the table too . incredibly unprofessional . usually employees are required to eat their lunch in a closed section not around actual paying customers ! seriously go somewhere else and not this restaurant ! try houston 's on scottsdale road . always good food and good service !
0	probably one of the worst ones i had in the past . waited forever for waiter , then food ... the food itself was alright would not recommend
0	begged for water ! ! ! never visit again . be warned !
0	the dishes sound good , but they all taste the same . i never waste food , but i had to throw the entire meal out . i was afraid that i would anger my animals if i gave it to them .
0	ordered street tacos and sat and waited and waited . the server checked on us three times and never told us that we were supposed to go to an area to get the tacos . the entertainer mentioned it and that 's how we learned the program . not only did the server not care either did the restaurant manager . a resort restaurant , sad . no hospitality here .
0	order was delayed by 30 minutes did not come together . dirty tables everywhere floor needs to be cleaned .
0	ordered the vegetable platter , paid 9.50 for what tasted like a bag of frozen vegetables , literally carrots cut like it was from a frozen vegetable mix . absolutely nothing like they were described on the menu . when we addressed it with our server , the response was they couldn 't be frozen as " they don 't have a freezer .... " however they serve ice cream . very disappointing food and response from the server , will never go back .
0	$ 40 for two blah burgers and cold tater tots . the open faced sloppy joe looked like something barely edible from 7eleven .
0	absolutely not the pizza was bad .. the chefs on duty could not be bothered to clean the hearth ... result pizza that was served with ash embedded into the crust ... after a few bites i was almost spitting it out .... plate was black / grey with combined with the oils from the melted cheese was just disgusting ... this is a cardinal sin ... new staff needed ... management clearly not taking the time to either train the staff or ensure standards of cleanliness in food service ... or that staff do not get lazy ..... better places but not in glendale ...
0	we walked in a half hour before they closed and they had already turned off the fryer so i couldn 't order the battered cod ... who makes themselves unable to serve their menu items before close ? the child at the start of the line made comment of not having gloves .... finally fetched gloves and then they asked if they could dish items without tongs .... so thank god they found gloves , right ? ! i don 't even care what the food tastes like , the adult who left these children here alone should be appalled .
0	$ 35.00 per person w / tip and they hit you up for a tip before you are even seated . very cheap and at best average food . i 've had better food at a hometown buffet . this was our first visit to both carnival buffet and the rio hotel / casino and will be our last . not one thing impressed us about either . not much else to say .
0	the only reason that we even ate here was because our breakfast buffet was partially comped. the only food that was edible was the hot dogs , mac and cheese and the mashed potatoes . we attempted to give all the items a chance to see if there was any room for redemption , but alas .... don 't bother coming here unless the food is free and you 're desperate , or you 're going to drink enough soda and liquids to justify the price .
0	granted it was thanksgiving , but they weren 't busy at all yet it took over 20 minutes for someone to take our order and more than 30 minutes to get it . the food wasn 't even mediocre . tasteless and cold when it finally showed up . we waited 20 minutes for the bill and another 20 for someone to pick it up . i would never give this establishment my business again .
0	mac & cheese was a bit on the sweet side , and pork belly was too salty without slathering it in another rather sweet sauce . the queue to get a table outside is a total mess . mostly whoever is closest to the door got seated first , disregard how long others have waited in line . the front of the house desperately need a system to manage the queue - may be should consider pen and paper ?
0	while ordering my friend asked what was in the 7 grain salad and the host stood there with the most " i hate my fucking job " look slapped over all his stupid face and muttered " 7 grains " to top it off they forget to even make what i ordered . no apology . fuck you squirly 's
0	wth is wrong with this chain ? they all suck so bad and continually set the low standard for fast food service and consistency .
0	service was horrible . truly horrid . lots of staff walking around . our waitress was totally inefficient . lots of wasted steps . she was gone from her section for long periods . pork and bread were dry . not as good as the lucilles at the district . and also they need busboys / girls . overstaffed but inefficient . bartender is also waiting tables plus serving at the bar plus performing bartender duties . will not be back .
0	food is so oily , even for a diner . serve staff was very good but god never again . about to throw up as i write this . got a philly cheese steak for 16 dollars . the meat was like elastic and chewy and smelt and tasted funny . disgusting and not even worth a penny .
0	oh well bobby your lose we went around the corner to a much classer restaurant the old homestead and didn 't even need ... more
0	the staff has no idea what 's going on , and how to communicate with each other or the customers . i ordered a shredded chicken salad , and the staff said they ran out , okay understandable , they let us know the chicken will be ready in 10 minutes , we wait , and we ask again when it will be ready , and they say in another 10 minutes . so 20 minutes later , and finally we get our chicken . the experience was definitely one i 'll remember to never come back to this location again .
0	dj ? ! ? gangster rap ? 180db ! ? ! profanity ? ! ? this was a very unpleasant experience . i would say , this is a first . normally i really like this place . so loud , you have to yell to converse with my tablemates and the staff . and seeing staff twerking and just gyrating makes this meal all that unappetizing . i definitely will not ever be back .
0	got to the restaurant at 11 : 05 am and was told that they are not serving breakfast anymore ! its states very clearly on their website and on their menus that breakfast is served until 11 : 30 ! when i asked about why i cant have breakfast when i was clearly early enough nobody had an answer . never go to this place .
0	there i was ready for an awesome burger . nope ! ! ! ! burnt bun and no flavor . did someone forget the seasoning ? yup ! a mcdonalds burger would of hit the spot harder ! thanks for the extra $ 15 loss ! hold your head down in shame johnny . my experience was straight boo boo .
0	i actually saw him double dip on it ..... which makes it even more nasty . no manager on duty at the time of my complaint , this person should be fired immediately . i guess you get what you pay for , a stupid kid not properly trained .
0	not only were the portions small , the prices high , but what they " call " dishes such as kebobs , humus or schwarma are not what you 'd expect at a real mediterranean restaurant . besides the lack luster food , the service was terrible . there 's a reason this place was empty at lunch time .
0	got seated right away on the patio . ordered a breakfast sandwich and pancake . 40 minutes later i got the wrong breakfast sandwich and a pancake with no syrup . i sent the sandwich back and asked for syrup . they returned with the wrong sandwich again . after sending it back for the 2nd time , they finally got it right . the saving grace to it all was the manager came over and said he would take care of the check . will not be returning .
0	20 minutes for menus , 55 minutes for food after ordering . major issues with each dish ( burned , missing ingredients , brown lettuce ) . avoid this place . tourist trap .
0	meats were all over cooked . cheap meats that tasted reheated . i 've been living here for 13 years and have been to the best buffets in town sadly this is one of them . just walk across the street for the same price and eat at capital grill that has fantastic food for the same price . when we called the manager out to show her we couldn 't even cut thru the rare beef she looked at us then said what did we want her to do about it . avoid this buffet if you can .
0	was seated with no silverware . when we asked for silverware it seemed like a hassle for the wait staff to get us silverware . we were brought 4 forks ( no knives ) and that is after receiving our entree . half the food was cold . salad that was ordered for appetizer came out after the entree and was not even correct . the place was half full so it 's not like they were slammed busy . would not recommend this place even if you had a gift card .
0	the food is cold , weird , and flavourless , and severely overpriced . skip it .
0	ate in during lunch last week . server not too attentive . got take out tonight . sat night . ordered online . order was never placed . bartender lied when i went to pick it up . she says she never saw the order . then says " oh . no it was placed . i just didn 't see it and that she only had to pack it up . " 15 mins later i got my order . cup of soup pictured on this site .. was half filled ... pasta was dried out and hard .. hardly any sauce . just overall bad experience . they need better met . this has been going on at this location , literally for years .
0	approximately one-third of the food is not edible . some of the food items that were edible were lukewarm at best . some were cold when they should have been hot . there are so many good buffets on the strip . this is not one of them
0	barely any communication , horrendous people skills . overall a bad experience that was not worth the money . leave your table messy so they can spend more time cleaning it . they deserve it .
0	i call 11 times for a pick up order and when she finally answers she 's rude like i 'm the one inconveniencing her ! ! then i ask about one the smoothies and she has her attitude saying she 's new and needs me to say the name ! i don 't know it that 's why i 'm asking ! ! ! then i 'm fed up and i ask for her managers number or a customer service number and she says you will have to call back another time because i don 't have the number . then i ask for her name which she said it was nicole scatz then hung up on me ! outraged !
0	my husband and i ordered food to go and arrived home to discover several of our ordered items were missing . i called and spoke with lauren the manager . she showed no concern for the inconvenience of us having to drive all the way back in order to obtain our correct order . further , she offered no compensation for the inconvenience . then to add insult to injury , we get our order corrected and return home once again , only to discover the lettuce in our salads were wilted .... brown and gross ! ! ! this has been the worse panera bread experience ever and we shall not return to this location .
0	awful food for a high price ! bill was $ 75 ! ! never ever again ! waitress was nice ... hence only star
0	the staff moves very slowly when preparing order , you have to repeat your order again at the register after ordering . the restaurant is filthy . crumbs and food all over the table , seat , and floors . asked restaurant to clean table and they just wiped the food onto the floor and chair and left it . didn 't even dry the the table , was soaking wet . highly do not recommend this location .
0	my husbands food was cold and full of fat . matt , a server or manager there , was unbelievably rude it is surprising he is even allowed in the service industry . will never go back to the diamond ! ! ! ! ! !
0	first off , the staff were extremely rude and looked like they hated life . i get it , working fast food sucks . but they had no respect . ordered a meal , only rang up a sandwich . also ordered a different sandwich in a wrap and got it as a normal sandwich . when we got our food , we opened it in the car and the sandwich completely fell out of the wrapper and was all in the bag . then the other sandwich was smothered in hot sauce to the point that the bread was completely soggy . we ended up throwing the sandwiches away and getting firehouse subs .
0	got ahi tuna salad , tuna was nearly frozen cold , tasted way too much like fish . clearly not remotely fresh . french fries were stale as hell and cold . never ever eating there again
0	paying a dinner price for lunch leftovers is anathema to my wife and me . the wait staff are superb , and very nice . the orleans has other places to eat on site , so avoid this one at all cost .
0	the fries were super soggy and didn 't taste like anything and the chicken was just gross and bad . if french fries are what you are after you would have better luck literally anywhere else .
0	the meat is overcooked and bland , the hummus is bland , all of their sauces taste like sugar . the rice is coated in a thick sludge of grease , the steak is no better . my wife and i paid $ 17 for two entrées , ate three bites and threw it away . i don 't ever throw food away . if i paid money for it , i am going to eat it . but i threw this away . that 's how bad it was . this food is a waste of time effort and money and calories . avoid it .
0	i tried the turkey chipotle club - it was , hands down , the saltiest thing i have ever purchased from a food service establishment . i have no idea why they would even serve something with that much salt ! awful ! ! !
0	terrible . it took 2 hours to get our food , our server was rude and non-communicative . apparently the computer system was down and the kitchen was backed up - how that explains a surly server i 'll never know . also , how it explains a luke warm mimosa i don 't know either . bleh . don 't waste your time .
0	i was in the drive thru for almost 10 minutes and then they had me wait in the parked spot for another 5 . i had to go inside to retrieve the rest of my order . i talked to a lady in a blue shirt , and i watched her service 10 other in store customers before she got to my order , which was sent 15 minutes ago . terrible service overall .
0	just got up and left ... seated for 15 minutes and no one came to even take a drink order !
0	we were told there was a 10 minute wait . 10 minutes was 1 hour . why ? the kitchen told the hostess not to seat tables because they couldn 't keep up . there were 1 / 2 of the tables empty . i feel terrible for the hostess and wait staff . this manager should be fired .
0	nice staff , awful food . if you want uncooked chicken wings , come here ! ! ! ! mt . wash location is legit , not downtown pgh . avoid food at all costs , drinks are great
0	not that i ever have very high expectations for buffets , but this was a new low for me . overall , food was flavorless . this is $ 12 buffet at best , definitely not $ 50 . not to mention the place is a complete zoo , no order what so ever . i don 't usually complain but wow - what a nightmare .
0	soggy , and tomatoes on margerita look and taste like canned . salad serving ( $ 15 ) is big enough for about 3 bites .
0	they overcharge and don 't even deliver what you pay for . lazy workers and horrible attention to detail . it 's sad when you pay for a full detail and nothing is touched inside the car while they insist it was cleaned . pathetic . stay away !
0	have been there more than once and literally seen rats and other creatures in and around the restaurant . poor service and rude staff . place should be condemned
0	rude hostess set the tone . waitress was too busy texting on her phone to bother for refills . cold fries to cold with the wrong sandwich but waitress never came back to check on us . what a waste of $ 84 .
0	don 't get me wrong , cora 's ( in general ) is one of the best breakfast places . however the one on carleton is the worst one i 've ever been too . i 've been here twice now . the first time , the food took a long time ( the restaurant was not very busy ) and one of the dishes was disappointingly sparse and looked nothing like the pictures ( which is a major disappointment considering it 's cora 's ) . the second time i came we waited over 15 minutes for someone to come take our order , once again the place was not busy . i usually highly recommend cora 's but i would highly recommend avoiding this one .
0	absolutely terrible service and prices that are insane , essentially dennys food for triple the price !
0	absolutely terrible service , did not bus my table after eating , all of the servers were sitting with a friend at the table behind us talking loud , i even heard the male bartender telling his friend " dude i partied so hard on sunday that i had a dream i did heroine for the first time and wasn 't sure it if was real or a dream "
0	do not order from this location . delivery is late , pizza is cold and they are always to " busy " to offer any good service .
0	couldn 't ask for a worse location and experience . if i wanted a three-story failure i would 've run into a burning building . paying for roped off parking is also the most amazing idea .
0	food okay but not worth the price considering service is terrible . got appetizer after meal came and then he forgot desert . it 's crazy .
0	waited 25 minutes just for bread . and i can assure you it was not busy at all . me and my family went in at 10 pm , ordered and everything and wasn 't given bread till 10 : 25 and our food barely came at 10 : 45 . very disappointed because i usually have a great experience but this time , not so much .
0	came in this morning and they didn 't have soup yet . came in at dinner time and they were out of bread bowls . she was super snotty about it when we came in this evening . then , didn 't even fill my daughters mac and cheese half way yet we paid like $ 5 for it . oh and it was barely warm . really crappy visit all around . first world problems , i know , but seriously it 's not tough to smile and be decent .
0	i came here with my family and we were treated terribly . i don 't often complain , but this experience was humiliating . they couldn 't confirm our seating , and were dysfunctional at every level . try another buffet .
0	they didn 't they just put the stuff back on it . my previous order said no onion since i 'm allergic . it came back with onion on it . the manager didn 't really seem to care . i could see threw the window all of the employees didn 't have hats or hair nets . i waited about 10 minutes after this , to see if they 'd put there hats on an they didn 't . how disgusting ! ! ! i won 't be going back
0	just getting someone to acknowledge you takes more than 5 minutes and trying to get the check and takeout container adds another 10 minutes . and if they try to memorize your order without writing it down , consider yourself lucky if they only forget 1 of your items ( for our table of 3 , the waitress forget 2 things because she did not need to write down our order ) . the food is pretty good , nice patio if you don 't mind smelling the smokers and listening to the tvs .
0	my boyfriend and i came in around 7 : 30 and the waitress was nothing but rude . she rolled her eyes at me and raised her voice when i asked her if i could get steamed broccoli instead of hash browns . um , rude much ? and the food came out about 30-40 minutes after we placed our order and it came out incorrect ! i told our waitress and she again , rolled her eyes and gave me attitude ! never coming back here again . save your money and go to somewhere else like mickie 's dairy bar and denny 's .
0	02 / 16 / 2016 i went this place with my girl and her friend we order foods and wait long time after served food they never come to table and ask what we need and even they didn 't ask what 's the spicy level foods not even good and rice over cocked this management must be more pay attention for this business .
0	i ordered " com tam bi cha thit nuong " omg the " cha " tasted like it has been frozen for 2 months and reheated in the microwave before serving it to us the " bi " did not have any taste the " thit nuong " was not palatable
0	my water never got refilled . 3 crew server but they all just seem so slow ! ! ! one guy just standing by the cashier while the girl / guy serve beings so slow can 't even refill our water
0	egado , pancit , kaldereta and even adobo puso ng saging ! it supposed to be sour than salty ! hypertension , heart attack and diabetes are filipinos ' main medical problems and place like this isn 't your best choice ! kabayan go easy on the patis and salt !
0	waitress only had two tables two wait on ! we ordered a bottle of plum sake for four people and she only brought us 3 glasses . i asked for lemon in my water and she forgot ! we had ordered a side plate and she never brought it . we had to get up and ask her for several items because she was such a flake ! when they brought us the plate , we had finished eating the sushi we ordered and told her we did not want the plate anymore ! did you think she deserved a tip ? i think not . . . . . . . .
0	my soda never came and i was charged for it . when i paid for my bill , i never got my change back ... i am chinese and i go to chinese restaurants on a regular but this service is next level low .
0	i just stopped going for their attitude , but the food was ok , and not bad at all , and they get really busy on friday nights so they must be doing something right . note : they are also halal now . tip : if you do end up here , ask for the bbq chicken to well done , i found the chicken to be pink from the inside few times , & i did mention it , the owners daughter response was " it is always well done " thanks for reading
0	i would go lower than that if i could . worst dining experience ever in toronto . bought a 45 dollar value coupon of dinner for two . one of the three dishes came with only four thin slices ( size of small doritos chips ) of eggplant on a iron plate which was not even heated . never going back .
0	how ever you spell it . totally understand you guys deal with tourists everyday , but there 's no need for the disgusting attitude ! when it 's not given she was very rude and took forever to assist me ! she noticed my friends and i standing at the entrance and did not acknowledged us she just looked at us waited about a good 20 mins and did not greet us and no smile ! not coming back ever !
0	.found a piece of chicken in the achari aloo . enough to put off my family , who are all vegetarians.the owner still had the audacity to charge us for all the other entrees ordered by us . simply awful service and unhygenic cooking conditions if you are a vegetarian avoid this place at all costs ! ! !
0	0 stars if i could 5 thumbs down guy making sushi uses glasses and kept pushing them up with his gloves , same gloves he was making the rolls with , has a bad old smell inside the place , rolls are super tiny and have no good flavor like other places i 've been too , what a disappointment and waste of 30.00 , i will never come back here and won 't recommend it to anyone i know , tomo in goodyear is 10xs better then this place
0	i checked the taxes on my own and they never add up , like making few cents off extra off everyone . the lady got upset when i requested a receipt , as they won 't give one for some reason . one time a family member got really sick for undercooked wings . what a shame ... never going again
0	the atmosphere is terrible i feel like i am going to get lung cancer the second i walk in . the main problem i had was at the mess up on my order and then they charge me extra for messing up on my order i will never come back and i would strongly suggest avoid this place at all cost .
0	they messed up our order when ordering online . we went to pick it up and just had to randomly find our order waiting for us because no one was helping us . we got the food home and realized they forgot some of our food and messed up other parts of our order . the food they did include was subpar . definitely won 't be back .
0	our waitress was so rude ! ! ! service was extremely slow thanks to her and the dumb food runners kept bringing us other people 's food . quality here sucks and their screaming o is not good at all . won 't be back here they need to hire new hostess / servers because that asian girl was so rude never again will i return .
0	this was the worst chinese food we have ever experienced . the meat was a slimy mass of tough covered with overlooked onions and day old brown sauce . the pad thai was mooshy , noodle fall apart and no meat . we ate 2 bites and couldn 't take anymore so bad our dog turned up his nose and gave us a look like what the hell !
0	waited 30 min for beef dumplings , by the time we finished the other two dishes , was told they were out of beef . food is ok if you can stand the wait
0	worst service even with their poor reviews my household kept using them because they were conveniently close to us . but our last order took over two hours and we called 4 times to check on the status and finally they said that their driver was lost . again as i said they are super close to us and we called 4 times and the management or the driver didn 't think to call the store or the customer to let us know .
0	this is so not authentic ! chinese food with a hint of hakka twist . not impressed .
0	1.0 star rating 3 / 25 / 2017 so the food was really good at this place . now they 've dramatically raised their prices and the quality of the food has dropped . they 've cut back on garnishes that really used to compliment the meal . also , the girls working behind the counter at bathurst and rutherford location are rude and kind of dumb . not impressed . was this review ... ?
0	omg ! worst ever , sashimi was literally gray .. they were using cleaning spray right on glass over food & same person cleaning was dealing with the food hands on with same gloves .. we stopped eating and left didn 't even want a refund just wanted to get out asap will never be back
0	the sushi rice crumbles when it is picked up to be dipped in the wasbi sauce . the baked shrimp and mussels are swimming in mayo and korean kalbi tasted like it was marinated for a week . the clam soup was disgusting . the crepe was rubbery and as for the roast beef , it was either the meat or the cutlery , but couldn 't get it to our mouths without trying to shove the whole slab in , caveman style . highlights of the meal was the udon and mini creme brulee , however , at $ 50 pp , i would never go back to this todai again .
0	$ 10 delivery fee and they refuse to come to your door ? they didn 't even get my order right .
0	you 're basically paying for the convenience of eating next to mekong supermarket . nobody should be paying over $ 9 max for a bowl of pho , it 's outrageous . service and the restaurant itself was nice . the cell signal kind of sucks all throughout mekong plaza , if you are indoors . ( i 'm at & t. ) to be fair , the viet broken rice plate place across from unphogettable is also super expensive , but their rice plates are soooo good . on the other hand , unphogettable 's pho is totally forgettable , nothing to write home about , and wayyy too expensive for pho . their name is a cute pun though .
0	" one of those experiences that will never be repeated - at least not at this place since we won 't be back . major fail on a basic of the business .
0	walked 10 minutes to order take out . i can 't tell you how this experience would have been due to the customer service issue . won 't happen again ! this left a bad taste in my mouth and i didn 't even taste the food .
0	it 's 1 : 45 and the restaurant isn 't that busy , 2 servers , both of which pass me several times , and no greeting ... no menu ... no water ... just flat out ignored . other patrons started to notice i was being ignored , even after hand gestures to get attention . when the server 's casual conversation started with the adjacent table i had to get up and just leave . unbelievable .
0	we had to ask for a menu , the guy just kinda threw it at us and left . got our tab and left . the service sucked . my first and last time here .
0	worst noodle shop ever . i recommend to call them before just in case to make sure they still have noddles .
0	i backed up into my bosses truck they would not cover his truck and i have full coverage with safeway . please be aware these people are crooks .
0	i was disappointed with the scraps used on my rainbow roll . i felt like it was not the same presentation and cuts of fish i would have received had we been dinning in . i expressed my disappointment to the sushi chef and he got aggressive with me . the waitress asked if everything was ok and i told her what had transpired . the manager stood around with his head in the clouds and said nothing . when i told him about the experience he starred at me with the deer in the headlights look and said nothing . he was lost . disappointing experience , will not be back .
0	went to pick it up and food was ready on time no wait . once i arrived home , the food was luke warm , but no worries . the lo mein was dry as hell . the green beans were good until i found a blond hair in my food ! there goes my appetite ! never again ! ! ! i get it hair sheds and that is why they make hair nets ! ! !
0	i am not the only person who got frustrated with this terrible service . food is very average . there are more restaurants which have better food and also serves food within a reasonable time ! tip : how to get ur food ? just go to the desk and showed ur angry face to one of the waitress and make ur complain . your food will be ready within 10min !
0	food is not fresh , all 4 of us had diarrhea after an hour . rice to fish ratio is bad , they gives u a lot of rice !
0	all i wanted outta life was a " / : ; ( ) $ & @ hamburger . kitchen can 't make a burger after 11 : 30pm . dumb .
0	the flamingo palace is terrible , i will not go back .
0	food not fresh . quality has realy dropped over recent years
0	what a shame for a place like this . i have been ripped off one time by them , not 2 ! ! ! buy your own food or go to subway ( 2 times cheaper and 2 times bigger and 3 times best )
0	11 $ for a spicy tuna roll .... during happy hour ... that 's all i have to say ... i can go across the street for 25 $ all you can eat
0	my friend convinced me that this one in bayly ajax is good ... but you 'll never find out unless you try . so we were here tonight and we ordered the usual japanese dishes with which salmon sashimi tops our list .... and they were frozen ! ! ! ! ! when i mentioned this to the waiter- he dismissed the fact they served salmon sashimi frozen & gave me a lecture on how to eat it ... ! plus their customer service really 2 hands down- not just thumbs nor fingers down but both hands .... and speaking of fingers- the waitress ' thumb is dipped into the bowl touching the food being served !
0	no chicken or pork , bo breakfast . they said 40 minute wait , 40 minutes later , still a 40 minute wait . wouldn 't you think they 'd had fresh items ready and cooked for the lunch crowd ? the line was long too with no bbq ? ? ?
0	12 : 22am jun 4 2017 while waiting for pho a small cocroach crawled to our table my family and i refused the food and left with disgust
0	12 / 26 / 2016 peak hour seating. came in at 2 : 30pm , prepared to wait for one to two hours to get in , but nope , virtual que told us the current wait time is 500 minutes , please come back after 10 : 30pm ... is this a joke ? so we have to wait until 10 : 30pm and pay roughly around $ 75 per person for a buffet ? no thanks. by the way , we never got that phone call or text message at 10 : 30 , imagine if we really waited ...
0	they were also out of my first choice ( coconut curry . ) i asked for extra veg in lieu of tofu , but there were only a few veggies . noodles were slightly sweet but otherwise quite bland .
0	it 's not even that big . plus it was slightly edible , not good . the amount of chicken was minuscule . very disappointing .
0	service sucked , food was so so , not fun .
0	before i got to her she spoke loud enough 25ft away saying " your server is on his way " after seeing me coming . then the server arrived and took drink order and said to make it easy are you ready to place your entire order ? very poor experience
0	im sure the rats even stay clear of this place .
0	go to joel 's or patisserie cafe for the same it is under $ 8 for 32oz .
0	the kicker is that to take your leftovers home they charge you for the the box . this seems ridiculous to me . i dont want to waste my leftovers but i dont want to pay for a to go box sry .
0	$ 14 for a meal give me a break way too much ripping people off i would not recommend the place
0	1.50 for a single little dried chicken wing 1.00 for a tiny little dried shrimp i leave with a little dried wallet and still an empty stomach just go to mcdonalds , man
0	ordered a spicy miso pork all they gave me noodles , a egg , and soup , and a tiny ice cream scoop of grounded pork . i should have went to kinton . never ordered from here again .
0	the waitress asked us twice if we wanted something to drink but never if the food was to our taste . definitely not traditional filipino , not cheap and not to be recommended . you seriously might as well stop by kfc .
0	lol ! the services sucked , and the ladies who took our money , decided to help her friends before helping us ... when we were clearly there waiting . not sure if i 'll come back because of the service .
0	the cleaning solvent was so strong that my party could not taste the food but soap . unacceptable . when i brought it to their attention they didn 't even open the doors to air the place .
0	makes no sense . never coming to this location . today was almost 29 minutes ! !
0	really ? we had a coupon for 20 % off the bill for 4 people our bill came up 112 $ after coupon . really not worth the food . series was really slow , she was bringing our drinks one by one it took us to 20 min to get our drinks . sushi variety was really small aseptically for me cause i m allergic to shell fish and almost all sushi had shrimp in them . the only think that was testy is duck and mango moose .
0	pho here is ok , not exceptional . i 've previously been here 2-3 times because it has nice ambience . but i know i won 't be going back because my boyfriend found hair in his pho ....... tangled within a piece of beef . we called the waiter over , he didn 't apologize , instead just offered another bowl . we didn 't want to make a scene or anything so we just got a second bowl . no discount or anything , either . i will be reminded of seeing my boyfriend pulling that hair out of his food every time someone mentions pho 88 , meaning i won 't be going back .
0	service was good , but food was not . booo .. we were hungry , desperate , and thought this place would be a good idea . it definitely was not a good idea . why ? 1 ) super salty 2 ) expensive 3 ) peking duck was horrible ordered : 1 ) peking duck : 1 / 5 highly do not recommend this dish . this was the worst dish on the table . it tasted like peking duck you would pick up at a fast food joint . 2 ) spicy garlic beef : 1 / 5 way , way salty 3 ) beef chow fun : 3 / 5 this was the only dish on the table that was edible .
0	we were seated near the kitchen away from the door , thus avoiding the chill . when we ordered one of the beef noodle dishes , the server pointed out it was cold so we quickly changed our minds . unfortunately , we ordered the fried rice and it was stale . it 's okay to use overnight leftover rice for fried rice but this was out longer . probably won 't be coming back here because of the food .
0	my very low expectations were " met " and i unfortunately wasn 't able to come away pleasantly surprised . i ordered the general tao chicken which tasted on par with chinese food court chicken except double the price ( $ 19 ) and half the size . it was " tasty " in a food court way which i regretted once i boarded my flight . would only come back because it is here or the soggy panini place across from here .
0	the food was average at best . horrible service . unnecessarily pretentious employees . $ 12 drinks . did i mention how bad the service was ? pass
0	everything that comprised my meal tasted frozen or canned with one exception . they tried to dress up the blah by putting a little bit of fresh basil on everything .
0	i know why he was calling in the windows i guess the owner district manager is coming into mr. lee i made mention to mr. lee about the poor service and all he did was smile vegas sorry for the wait .
0	tried to charge 2 $ more because they chose to package in separate containers . it was so poorly made we threw it out ,
0	i would not recommend this place even if they have good prices , the food was not worth it at all .
0	wayyy to expensive and i should know better . could of spent 9 dollars at panda next door for twice the amount of food
0	thanks but no thanks . the service was bad but the food was worse . we won 't be back .
0	that 's just way too much . 1 star because it tasted good but it hardly had any chicken in it and it was too small of a serving for the price we paid ! might try this place for their buffet since i guess that is what it 's known for . until then , 1 star !
0	the quality was at bottom half of all toro 's i 've eaten in my career . service was snooty the stuck up waittress refused to ask kitchen for a special request for o-yako-don which they 've done for me before .
0	18 % gratuity on a party of 8 ? i wouldn 't normally complain but when my drink is empty all night and the server doesn 't speak english it 's disappointing .
0	that 's pretty high dollar for a small portion . the thai food was average at best . i 've had awesome thai for $ 10-11 in other cities . the atmosphere is nice , but not impressed with food or cost and i love thai , just not here .
0	subpar overpriced food , poor service , had to ask four times for bill , then intercept the hostess at main table to actually print it out . not only did we have to pay 18 percent gratuity for terrible service we were taxed on the gratuity as well ! please avoid this restaurant at all costs .
0	after i had this beef noodle soup i felt super thirsty for whole afternoon . i was super regret why i picked this place to eat ! ! the service was ok ! ! ! my advice : 1 . save your money to go china town to eat better noodle with fair price . 2 . don 't even try the dim sum ! ! !
0	it should have been complimentary . my gf and i shared a toronto roll and an avocado roll . both were quite flavorless even though the toronto roll was described as being spicy . this truly was one of the worst sushi experiences we have ever had . i 've been to japan several times and lived in asia for a while . so i know good sushi .
0	bar drinks take forever . our first round came in a timely manner ; however , the second round took an hour . 2 . the food is good , but it took 1.5 hours to get food for only half of the table ; the other half of the tables food came 20 minutes later . 3 . the server was trying hard , but was bogged down by inefficiencies surrounding the bar and back of house . 4 . the manager came by when " it was convenient " as she claimed to be expediting food . our apps and second round were comped . final thought : good intentions , bad operations
0	2 ) served only one cup of tea for two seated guests . 3 ) salmon teriyaki tasted old and left an undesirable aftertaste the whole day . 4 ) service was slow . pretty terrible experience .
0	everything except sushi taste really bad , steak and calamari taste like nothing 2 . foods so slow , we wait for like an hour and the order never came 3 . don 't recommend this place , not worth it .
0	when you order a few lobster dinners and a 14 year old wants chicken fingers since they don 't eat lobster .. don 't ask if they are 12 and refuse to serve them and force then to order a crappy adult chicken dish .
0	-1 for the price , 100 for two , you 'd expect great things ... -1 for mediocre service , asking for refills shouldn 't be necessary when your paying this much . -1 for misrepresentation , there 's nothing chinese about this grill . sorry , but the chinese food at studio b buffet is better lol .
0	) horrible service , the wait took forever for refills and sushi roll . they do that because ayce has a time limit . 2 . ) horrible waitress that makes customers feel uncomfortable with her vibe and tone . 3 . ) food was okay , not all sushi were fresh . again , wait took forever . i wouldn 't recommend this place , preferred doh or other ayce sushi .
0	unfortunately , i am unable to comment on the quality due to the extremely poor service ( no explanation / apology / offer to compensate either ) . i have previously read about their terrible delivery times , but i 'll give most places a chance . i will not be giving " i love sushi " a 2nd chance . even for etobicoke / japanese restaurants , this is unnaceptable .
0	cannot even enjoy the food when it takes so long
0	( microphone drop ) we are so disappointed . the food is okay . i do not recommend . it may be better if it was warm on delivery . maybe pick up would be a better option if you are looking for ' good ' chinese .
0	concur with previous reviewers about waiting 15 minutes just to get a waiter to come by to get drink orders and another 15 minutes to bring the drinks out . haven 't even gotten the food yet , but felt compelled to write this review .
0	horrible service . how does someone take 15 mins to clean a 4 person table . they literally had 2 waitress doing stupid task like arranging the menu at the counter instead of cleaning up tables or seating customers . 1 hr to get food and i 'm still waiting on 3 / 4 of my other dishes .
0	2-the only reason for 1 star review ... the cost ! $ 10 for a medium sized bowl of soup with minimal white and dark meat is ridiculous . if this was $ 6 it would make sense and deserve a 3 or 4 star rating , ten bucks is nuts . 3-friendly service and good wraps / rolls .. ultimately , $ 30 for 1 roll and 2 smaller soups , overcharged , makes it frustrating to eat out , it 's too expensive !
0	katsu addon for mini rice bowl is $ 2.00 . they charged me $ 2.75 for " pork belly bao . " 2 . found hair in my mini rice bowl . no it was not mine . don 't get scammed out of your 3 quarters for parking meters . it would be a zero star but i will add 1 star for their lit business card . cheers ! update : henry f , the owner has messaged me personally to show his inexperience handling bad reviews , or people in general . what a shame : \
0	can you replace chicken with tofu instead ? " waitress : " sorry , our chefs don 't make changes to dishes . they cannot understand " don 't go here for vegetarian food that 's overpriced and mediocre at best 3 ) service is slow 4 ) no credit card ( not a typo )
0	no hair nets , caps , or anything . as a result , there was a dark curly hair in my food - could have been a pube ... ew . i knew i was bound for trouble when the person handling money cooked my food . smh you should always have a separate person to handle and cook food to keep that area sanitized . 2 . prior to discovering the hair , the food wasn 't half bad . but $ 9 for a small ramen noodle with 2 chunks of steak and soup the size of a tea cup .... cray cray 3 . worst wi-fi connection you have ever experienced . eat elsewhere .....
0	not authentic at all , let alone food quality is bad . 2 . they say 5 % discount with cash . but they refuse to issue a receipt . at the same time , they are still charging full amount of tax ( handwritten ) . go figure .
0	the rest were horrible . the one dish was the seabass . the texture was great , but it was a little bland . i would not recommend this restaurant . the resort itself , encore , is very nice and i enjoy staying there .
0	i couldnt hear what she wqs saying .. and thr iwner said maybe i should quit talking so much then maybe i would hear . i have a hearing disability . im a customer . shes serving me . her comments about my hearing or communication issues are not her concern . i feel disrespected and i 'm never coming back here . i 'm also a yelp reviewer and i gave her restaurant 1 star . yelp can be read all over the world . congratulations your an idiot in over 50 languages .
0	$ 7.5 for a ' large ' pho that is equal to a medium in most restaurants . don 't let the pictures fool you , the bowl might be big but 80 % of it is soup . 2 ) soup was way too salty and not enough pho flavour ( such as star anise and other spices used in pho ) it seems like they were trying to mask the lack of spices with extra salt . the only good point is the atmosphere which is very new and fancy for a pho place and the service which was very courteous probably because it 's new . i will never go back though because the food was sub par to say the least .
0	vermecili was actually not bad but shrimps on there taste rotten . this place is not clean from its appearance , menu was greasy n dirty , same thing with utensil n cups . lost my appetite before the food being served .
0	only a handful of tables were occupied . hostess was aloof . sat at the bar . after waiting 10 mins with no service , we decided to leave .
0	produce wasn 't fresh . trying to pick out some fruit was so difficult since half of them were bad 2 . what the hell is going on with customer service ? ! cashier didn 't smile once , no hello , just sorta there and made me super uncomfortable . at the end of the transaction she just left all my purchased items on the counter and avoided eye contact , so i asked for a bag and then tried to break the ice so with a " thank you " and she replied with " k " ? ? ? ? ? ? 3 . $ 10 minimum for card use ? puh-lease .
0	1 / 4 the food . fake accents and they really don 't give a # puck now whatsoever . they hung up on me twice ... ' no understand ' and i 've gone there for over 6 years . " no english ? ... " if you saw the slop pix of the 1 / 4 sided portions you really boycott . new management or just lazy ass staff is a joke smoking on the patio rather than working . now no liquor license . no bubble tea . no service . unless you 're asian it 's a 45 min wait . returning this clown chow tomorrow . not expecting anything but my $ 30 back .
0	today , i gave it another chance and ordered a sauteed seafood udon hoping a cooked meal will be better . nope , it was just as bad , got 2 small shrimps , 1 mussel , 1 scallop and some shredded imitation crab meat . the scallop did not taste as it is supposed to ; gamy , disgusting , probably stored in the freezer for way too long . therefore , i did not take the chance for the mussel ... only the udon noodles . nothing is fresh and it 's a japanese restaurant . i will never return there , i do not recommend .
0	rude servers 2 . mediocre food 3 . took 30 minutes to get an order of siumai . ! ! ! ! 4 . 20 minutes to get a soda ? try to avoid this place !
0	rude service . waiting time was over ten minutes . and the server who arranged the table was wearing a long face . 2 . the pork and vegetable noodle soup was flavorless , and it did not worth the price . 3 . the shrimp dumplings all sticked to each other and the paper . i gave some suggestions to the manager that they should use a bigger plate and separate them before steaming . but she said they didn 't have a big stove to cook them . lol , are you kidding me ? ? they never want to improve the service and think about how to cook . so never ever go to this place to waste your time and money .
0	had to ask to have our table cleaned before we ordered our lunch . order was wrong when it got to the table . there was no taste of curry in the curry dish.the beer was warm , after bringing it to there attention i was told 15 minutes later that it would be 2hrs before the beer got cold.all in all the food was bland .
0	we tried the ayce & what a big disappointment . lechon special was definitely old ( chewy & not crispy ) , pork adobo was tasteless & vegetable was overcooked . i 'm surprised this has a 4-star rating ! skip ! ! !
0	the food is bland and possibly overlooked . i didn 't enjoy my experience at all ; the cashier / order taker didn 't specialize in customer service at the least and to top it all off they have a 92 sanitation score . will not be visiting again and suggest that you take your business elsewhere .
0	sushi was ' meh ' and service was extremely poor yet , the restaurant was quite slow . ( we were seated immediately and there were plenty of open seats ) shame on my friends for recommending this place . unlikely to return .
0	the service was awful ! they forgot some of our order for over 30 minutes , still charged us for everything . we constantly had to ask for refills on our beverages and they weren 't even busy . we will not be back .
0	should have left then but i got one more roll with yellowfin tuna ( maguro ) because my first roll with spicy tuna wasn 't terrible this also had . terrible muscle texture obviously they don 't know how to cut fish .. all the fish was served on warm-hot temp . rice - terrible ! your fish is being cooked by the rice it was hot enough .. by far worst sushi in vegas i 've had yet other than grocery store sushi .. go to blue fin or osaka or really anywhere else .. my favorite thing about sushi mon is that it is packed ! ! ! such a shame we live amongst so many mammalukes ..
0	should have walked away this time too and i 'm definitely not coming back
0	worst customer service ever . the guy that seated us gave us attitude and was plain rude . the pho was bland and wasn 't worth the wait or the rude service . no one ever came to check on us to refill our water glasses . definitely will never go back .
0	the food is not that great and the sushi is below average . you can do a lot better and cheaper for an all you can eat place .
0	below average food , uncleaned plates and glasses . bad service . no water was given for the first round of buffet had to ask for it . very unhappy not recommended . the guy with specs at the bar has a very bad attitude .
0	generally i can add in all the fixings and get an awesome bowl of noodles , but this time it was quite disappointing . not sure what they are doing , but we will not be trying to figure it out .
0	they behave as they have done you some favour . the food is not the best and they are not the only vietnamese restaurant in toronto .
0	the noodles were super crispy and the shrimps were large . but they lost all other 4 stars because of the amount of cockroaches i saw around the resturant . ew ew ew . i will not return .
0	wtf. curries are watered down like soup. walked out. never again. worst resto i 've ever been too
0	it 's sunday , and there 's no 50 % off sushi special .
0	i wouldn 't even start on the food. i would give a 0 star rating if possible .
0	the one woman running the front of the house lacked customer service skills . she was not pleasant at all . food was mediocre and was served without serving utensils . when we requested serving utensils the woman was displeased that we even asked for them . the only time she somewhat cracked a smile , if it was even a smile , was when i asked for the check . there are definitely much better thai places in town . not coming back .
0	it took so long for the wait staff to take our order . it took equally long for anyone to pay attention to see what we want during our course of the meal . it took even more to get our check . food wasn 't bad but sure not going back for the service they provide . it wasn 't worth it
0	usually we go to the lake mead and buffalo location ( so much better ) . but we got a 20 % of coupon in the mail and decided to drive the extra mile . big mistake ! the staff was rude , the store was filthy and the food was horrible . we will not be returning .
0	horrible service , bad food , and unreasonably busy for something that doesn 't make sense in terms of price vs quality . we actually had to question what dim sum dish is being served as everything looks grey . would not return .
0	food was really good . however , for staff i will give 0 stars . we dealt with 4 of them and all of them were very rude . they try to crack jokes which are very insensitive to the customers . i will not recommend this . it doesn 't matter how much you want to order , they 'll bring you whatever they think it 's right for your party .
0	a great place to pass time with friends and family . but food is one star compared to panda express .
0	but the service was horrible . the ladies that brought out food out were straight out rude .. not to mention they constantly would forget to bring out food and drinks we ordered
0	they finally installed service buttons to call them . food is very mediocre here . drinks come in nice cups but they 're so meh so come here for drinks or late night snaking is ok when no where else is open .. --- they normally closed late 2am on weekdays but i came today at 1am and they 're closed ! ! ! drove all the way in the snow and so far and only know them for being open late and they 're closed so disappointed ... no notice or note apologizing or explains why they just decided to be closed ... go for tea is open go here instead
0	the worst service i ever had . i had to constantly wait for my server for service and he had a major attitude problem . maybe it 's because i look young and therefore he didn 't treat my friends and i with any respect ( we used a groupon service as well ) . the food was nothing to talk about . it was one my worst experiences ever . i 'm sad to write this review , but i had to let people know about the bad service and mediocre food .
0	this place is absolutely horrible ! i ordered shrimp pad thai and pot stickers and it was $ 27 .... the guy said it was gonna be 45 min. well it took them 1 : 20 min to delivery the food when i live 10min from this place ... now the food was horrendous , the pot stickers were cold and hard. and the pad thai was one the worse thing i ever ate .. i ask for shrimp and they gave me chicken , and the pad thai it self was disgusting it taste it like dirty water , no flavor at all , we ended up throwing it away after wating 1 : 20hr ! ! never againg ...
0	if you don 't understand enough english to comprehend what your customer is saying then please do not insist that you are correct when you have no understanding of the situation . he had no idea what we were upset about and kept arguing with us for no reason . and then to top it off , because he was heated about his misunderstanding , he told the server to take back our food . what kind of manager handles a customer service situation in that way ? so disappointing as i 've been a patron of this place for years . it only takes one horrible manager to make an establishment look unprofessional .
0	waited for 2 and a half hours for delivery , offered free spring roll ? ! ? still waiting ...
0	what are my credentials to be badmouthing this " highly " rated yelp institution ? 5 years living on honolulu and knowing what sushi restaurants are supposed to taste like , but what do i know ... uggh worst night ever afterwards smh
0	the waiter took it back & said the chef will cook another one . so it seemed like 5 min & portion got smaller , & same problem . i walked out & if i can give 0 stars for food quality i would . i should 've went to thai house .
0	not friendly at all . chef was eating lunch when i walked in . he got up to go cook with a full mouth of food . okay dining area .. floors look very dusty . this place is new right ? white walls are scuffed n dirty ... chicken not tender , was rubbery . yummy fountain soda . compared to other places serving size was a bit smaller . this is . last resort spot to eat .
0	i even had to ask for a spoon when i got my soup ... and i waited while the waitress went to the next table to take their order before bringing me a spoon to eat my soup .... this soup soup is so so .
0	i ordered pepper steak which had a horrible taste and was hard to chew like beef jerky i also ordered the general tso shrimp which was below average taste and the sauce was very watered down along with over cooked vegetables the rice looked and tasted like it was half steamed half fried rice i ate very little and threw it in the garbage
0	2nd appearance , food was rotten bangkok . chicken satay was disgusting and tasted rancid . it was if they were serving spoiled food . wont return
0	2nd time he refused my groupon saying he dont take groupon on the weekends which does not.say anything about that in the voucher . so i had begged the owner to please honor my groupon because i live very far ans came back twice . he was very rude ! ! and said he is tired of groupon people trying to get free food .. so dont waste your time 1 . owner is rude 2 . place was a mess 3 . hours change by the day 4 . alot of reviews about owner refusing service to alot of people 5 . menu is very limited when you try to order everything is not available
0	the second time we went there my wife ordered chicken mein fun when we got home she immedietly got sick . this new yorker won 't be going back .. i 'm not going to spend another night cleaning up my wife 's vomit .
0	after decorating plates next door at color me mine . the food tasted very good until the msg kicked in . hydrating all night and nasty after taste of the msg . you should have big bold print informing people you use it .
0	we decided to give it a second chance and the service was still slow . will never return .
0	1st visit was really great ayce but ......... second visit went just for ramen and something was not right soup base was no flavour and to make things worst i got food poisoning off of ramen i was amazed ramen of all things to get food poisoning from that 's just messed up will not go back
0	if one or two of the skewers i ordered had this problem ， fine ， maybe badluck ， however smelled some cons because you overdid it. so change your tricks or not wouldn 't be my problem. last time i went was last time ever. so long
0	2 ) food is good and served fast but its not something you must try category not for costly 3 ) waiters have no common sense of saying hi / hello or thank you / have a nice day ( even after providing 15 % tip ! ) when you get sense that there is no point in doing reservation for rude service it too late .
0	# 2 : a server who could not remember our 2 item order . asked again what our order was and still got it wrong . # 3 : vegetarian egg rolls came filled with pork . the management came out and picked up our food with bare hands , then left without a word . hid in the kitchen . we left as soon as possible ..... never to return !
0	the menu option is very limited , 10 dishes in total ? 2 . no window in the entire dining area . 3 . the waiter basically gave us the menu and asked us to write down the orders for him . ( hello ? are you serious about asking customers to do the job for you ? it was 4pm in the afternoon so it was not busy at all . ) 4 . the chicken they served is very old and dry , not fresh at all . yuck ! 5 . we ordered 3 dishes plus 1 small cold plate , costed us $ 110 . enough said ? definitely will not return !
0	the waitress seems impatient when explaining the drinks 2 . the food quality is not good at all ! ! we ordered the prix fix menu . the first time i see an appetizer has both cooked and raw fish on the same plate ! the sashimi is even in chunk ! not in slice ! the lobster miso soup , the lobster is not fresh at all ! for the sushi , the octopus tastes like rubber . the mango exploration tastes like regular juice . won 't ever come back again ! so disappointed !
0	the zucchini in bibimbop was spoiled and smelled and tasted sour . 2 . i found dried green onion stuck in my rice bowl . gross . those are the reason i gave one star . other complaints are tofu soup wasn 't hot enough , so the raw egg inside wouldnt cook . i asked them to boil it and and it took long time in the process . of course we had to replace the bibimbop . the galbi tasted okay , but tofu didnt taste good . bulgogi was too salty .
0	tongs were dirty 2 . the waiter burned me with hot oil when switching the grill and didn 't know how to handle it when it blistered up immediately 3 . assistant manager lied about the discount given and wouldn 't admit it until he was cornered into an unrecoverable hole 4 . was told i would be contacted for a follow up but have received no contact good luck with this place , food is pretty good but absurd service and be ready to be burned by the grill switching as they aren 't trained well
0	was not welcomed upon arrival 2 . server was bland ..... borderline rude 3 . asked for brown rice , and received white rice . 4 . the size of the tom yum soup for two looked like a small soup bowl ..... 5 . the curry had little flavor and was runny 6 . the manager said that there would be no bill - i mentioned that i did not complain for that reason . the bill was brought .... in full . a totally disastrous experience - will never return .
0	completely disappointed in the quantity of the meat ! 2 ) is this meat ? or is it rubber ? the struggle is real . completely disappointed in the quality of the meat . 3 ) what are these flavors ? salt and ginger for the chicken with cashews . salt and ginger for the beef in oyster sauce . salt and ginger on everything and way too much of it .
0	the employee cleaned it with tissue . 3-ordered chicken biryani but the rice was really hard and rice was re warmed again . very unhygienic dirty restaurant . 4-they bring silverware in normal tissue ridiculous . 5- stay away from this restaurant i asked for the owner or the manager but was refused as the server stated " i cannot give you their name or their contact . " i did not get any type of apology from them . shows you how bad this restaurant is . also will seek out to state of nevada in regards this
0	1 ) worst sushi rolls and tataki in the valley ( ordered the las vegas roll this time ) 2 ) slow service 3 ) over priced happy hours are only from 11 am to 5 pm ( why not just say that they don 't have any for employed people )
0	i am utterly disappointed . i guess i am coming to realize that famed restaurant does not necessary means good food. one star for the only dish i think it 's outstanding : the broiled yellowtail collar .
0	instead we had a glass of water each . we were charged $ 1.20 for each glass of markham tap water + hst for a total of $ 2.71 . we won 't be going back to fung lam court any more .
0	plus no immediate bank machine at that corner , get interac ; it 's about a decade + late but you can still get on the technology wave ..
0	it 's an egg for god sake ! ! ! and she forgot the milk had to asked for it twice .
0	they forgot to heat up the cast iron plate . $ 16 spicy octopus was like chewy rubber and totally inedible . very very dissatisfied with the dinner experience . first and last time to eat here . there are better korean restaurants around .
0	stay away ! taco bell would have been a better choice !
0	let 's start with the " chicken yakisoba " they skimp on the chicken . and the char on the meat itself is overpowering . awful . the roll . pay $ 2 to get it upgraded with salmon and they forget it . nice . wouldn 't recommend . makes sense why they have " new management . "
0	20 mins before closed told me they wouldnt make me a chicken bowl because didn 't have any chicken already cooked and needed to clean up
0	20 mins for a scoop of rice and dry chicken is unacceptable should 've went to wendy 's and i wouldn 't have been late getting back to work .
0	20 minutes after eating at this place i had to run home and purge my bowels don 't know what they put in that crap but man it does not stay with you food wasn 't that great service sucked prices were high went there one time and only one time never going back
0	very slow and no one cares . now they say i am next . six more people get orders grrr . this place is ate up .
0	at almost 3 pm . the service was trash , the restaurant was filthy . i had just finished working under a house and was cleaner then this restaurant . turns out order was never made . 10 outta 10 will not come back .
0	i called tonight to order $ 28 worth of food to be delivered 0.5 km away . he says minimum order is $ 30 . he refused to deliver unless i order more . i cancelled my order . mind you this is at 8 : 45 on a monday night which is not exactly a peak time . i am just pissed off at the pettiness of the jerk on the phone ( and they are always semi-incompetent on the phone ) . i guess i will spend my usual 2x $ 50 month orders elsewhere . i am extremely disappointed .
0	sadder still to see a great traditional japanese sushi restaurant end , and not carry on the tradition . we would go here for consistently great fresh fish and great service . they have also trained many young sushi chefs through the years here in phoenix . great japanese food isn 't about fancy rolls and combinations , but about great fresh ingredients . end of an era . i agree .
0	very disappointed in the serving size . see photos !
0	if you look closely in 1 of the pictures , they added more rice in the meat tray and placed meat on top to give me less of a portion of meats ! ! and they forgot my side dish that of macaroni salad ! ! i 've added pictures in a post to this as well so you all can see
0	when you make take out , do you get charged for the to go containers , to go bag & etc .. ? i can 't believe 1 pho with 1 spring roll would cost $ 21.29 . when i asked for break down , they said they charge for vegetables & to go containers . $ 8.95 pho $ 4.95 spring roll $ 1.20 tax ( roughly ) you pay $ 5 to give business ... ? there 's 1st time for everything but i don 't think i would eat here ever again eventhough i am a frequent here ( at least once a week , at 3 times a week sometimes ) .
0	i sent it back . yes , they told me i didn 't need to pay for it - but that 's not remotely the point . i came here to eat dinner , not go home hungry . do not order the duck . awful . if i could write another bad review i would .
0	both pad se eww dishes appeared hastily made and did not taste good . restaurant was chaotic with many unhappy customers . will never go back to this restaurant . go to brown sugar in rocky river instead .
0	horrible service . still waitin on the shrimp salad . never coming back
0	can 't comment on the food as the service was so bad to begin with . never to return .
0	i got an email saying delivery would be free today through the weekend . i thought what a perfect time to do my first delivery . i was still charged $ 13.00 just for delivery . bad first impression . i won 't be ordering from here again .
0	yet they had the guts to say if you don 't finish the dishes they gonna charge you . the har gao tasted so bad compare to regular dim sum places . the miso soup tasted like water . it absolutely had no taste in it . service wasn 't that bad but it 's just too pricey for dinner . i disliked how they only offer 5 pieces of sashimi per person . cuz then i had to keep ordering from them which i found very annoyed . if you are looking for mainly japanese food then avoid this place .
0	? ! no thanks , i 'll pass . go to social house at the city center and do the tasting menu there . so much better !
0	if you ever need to charge $ 11 per small noodle soup , you need to pay attention to the environment . once in my life time experience ! !
0	25 cent charge for under five dollars ? ok 1.95 $ small portion frys ? ok taking 10 minutes to cook said frys ? not ok i watched the lady cook another order full bbq plate in 8 minutes but my frys took 10 mintutes ? thanks but no thanks .
0	$ 25 for a bowl of soup , with 2 small slices of pork bbq , definitely not wort the price .
0	the food isn 't that great and it looked like its been sitting out for awhile . the food is bland and the waiter isn 't the friendliest .
0	i 'm not sure what they are doing wrong , but this is crazy .
0	most places would serve it as complementary . food portion is small . service is lacking .
0	food was soggy . when one car takes too long with large order why don 't they ask that person to pull to the side so the rest of us can go ahead ?
0	i also felt the employee was trying to push us to order expensive stuff because the business had declined due to the rnc convention in town that week . asked advice on the sake selection - and the most expensive bottle was suggested . food was just mediocre - had a stomach ache afterwards . in addition to the astronomical prices ( kobe beef was $ 160 for 8 oz - just saying ) it was also a hookah bar . interesting combo - japanese sushi bar with middle east hookah . you know you are in the wrong place when this happens . my eyes and lungs were burning ! im sorry i gave them business .
0	? ? ? then take that delivery service off from yelp ! ! you are misleading customers !
0	i called eat24 they called the restaurant and the owner answered . he says he doesn 't know where the food is , the deliver guy left already and he tells the eat 24 rep she needs to call the restaurants 3rd party delivery guy . they were absolutely no help and hung up on the eat 24 rep . the delivery guy never answers the phone and my food never gets delivered . no customer service from this restaurant .
0	a big disappoint ! ! ! ! ! i had seen this featured on some food channel . it was approximately 1 cup of rice with 2 pieces of tofu , 4 miniature carrots and a bunch of strings of fried carrots on the top . it came lukewarm . the waiter never came back to see if everything was allright . to add insult to injury it cost me $ 19.88 for that cup of rice .
0	lunch break at work already over . called restaurant to check status and all i got was a rude response .
0	we 're definitely finding another place to order from after months of terrible service .
0	just brutally bad . order at your own risk . for the sake of balance , the potato salad was excellent .
0	2 hours for delivery on a thurs nite from 7th ave-15th ave and mcdowell ... ridiculous
0	warm soda and cold food . really great . and when i called to say something about it she said " sorry " nothing to make amends or to keep my business . never again . let 's also take into account its wednesday night .
0	called the restaurant and the woman answering the phone couldn 't find my order and asked me if i had ordered from " thai house . " i will never order from here again . no follow up or attempt to make it right .
0	go to little shanghai down the street . real service there .
0	2 hour wait for delivery $ 70 charge way overpriced and the slowest service i have ever seen when i called and they told me it was on the way and would be another 15 to 20 minutes after i had already been waiting almost 2 hours there 's plenty of better sushi places here even if they deliver i wouldn 't call that customer service is terrible
0	terrible service . don 't waste you 're money ordering from this place . if you any restaurant in verdun that uses livraison sud-ouest , do not order unless you don 't mind waiting 2.5 hours for cold soggy food .
0	2nd time coming to this location. first time we came on a sunday around 7 pm , on yelp it says they are open till 8pm but was already closed. handwritten sign on door says they close at 6 on sundays. ok , not a big deal. came today to try the food. sunday at around 12 : 30 pm. door closed. with closed sign. no note or anything to indicate if they will open at all today. i dont think im coming back .
0	with all the great ramen places in lv , don 't waste your time here . as i left , i wanted to tell incoming diners to go somewhere else ... it was that bad .
0	not impressed . brought my asian girlfriend and she said we are not allowed to come back .
0	was there today at about noon ( 22may2016 ) . to begin with the guy at the register taking orders was very surly , as if we were bothering him by placing an order . then when the order came i asked for some paprika for my order to which he responded ' i 'll have to charge extra for that " . i 'll say at my regular sam 's the paprika and teriyaki sauce are with the other condiments-not hidden under the counter . i will never go back to this location again . i 'll stick with my regular sam 's !
0	first time was bad and now am still disappointed . they open at 4pm so at 4 : 15 i called to order some delivery and the guy who answered asked be to call back in about an hour ? what is the point of opening at 4pm if you cant order anything ? not expecting them to be around for much longer , looks like there are lots of poor reviews here about the service and the food .
0	ordered lettuce wraps and no lettuce . grayhawk pei wei is poorly run .
0	our cups of green tea were empty our entire meal , service is slow , and mediocre quality . much better places in the valley . i will not be coming back for a third try.i love to support local businesses but this one needs some improvement .
0	had the same waitress , must say i am surprised she is still there . she needs training on how to speak with customers . management is not much better , no enthusiasm or appreciation for customers . customary things like hello , how is everything , thank you for coming etc . décor is awful , had to step over a banner laying in the middle of the floor to get to the restroom . find somewhere else , like good china or chang lee . food is mediocre here .
0	they do not accept credit cards at all and they charge a fee on debit purchases no matter how much you spend ! now i know why this gas station is always empty and the one across the street is always packed ! ! would give no stars if that was possible !
0	i was ok waiting because i was craving good pad thai but i was oh so disappointed . it tasted like burnt wok with tasteless grilled chicken . no peanut sauce or peanuts anywhere . of course i was home by the time i realized this
0	right like kfc runs out chicken . # fraud # wasteoftimeandgas
0	2pm week day ... nothing stocked ... no food ... waste of money ... others have said it 's been like this for last couple months .
0	most chinese ppl would find this restaurant offensive . i only ate here b / c i saw mr wynn himself eating lunch here . i wouldn 't come back . they also have a terrible service issue . more specifically , the servers standing there . not servicing the customers . no need to bring your own soy sauce ... food 's salty enough .
0	however today , after waiting 15 minutes , someone comes to take our order . when we start to order , she tells us 4 different meats they are out of ( 3 are what we wanted to order ) . when we decide we will just leave , the waitress got an attitude with us !
0	yangtse does this in abundance . i tried the wonton soup and the szechuan style dumplings . firstly the second dish contained wontons not dumplings ( i know not much difference in theory ) but the wontons and the dumplings were the same . the hot sauce ( which i asked if it was ma la ) had nothing to do with authentic " ma la . " where is my szechuan peppercorns infused yumminess .. dude .. ! ! the pork in the wontons / dumplings were rancid , indicating frozen for ages , reheating in the morning and serving in the evening kind of food . do i have to be dissuaded everytime to ever try chinese cuisine in the valley ! ! sigh ...
0	2 times i ordered online from this place , both time they cancelled my orders , will never order back from this restaurant , what a joke !
0	both visits weren 't good . i 'm just not a fan period . lengthy wait time unorganized wait staff isn 't helpful not impressed .
0	2 weeks ago ordered takeout at the wigwam and pecos store in henderson nv. they forgot our little tiny cup of macaroni salad. called back and they said we can get a free one on our next order. so called up to order tonight and the manager marco tells us that when they forget people 's food , the policy is to throw away the note after 1 week that says what people are owed. so over 1 little cup of salad , they lost are business for good. beware , you must double check your bag before you walk out or they will happily pocket your money and save the food .
0	last night a 25-35 min delivery time , ended up being 65 min . no more . you 've lost this customer .
0	we throw up a lot it 's like hell that moment , because our stomach is burning ! dirty and filthy food !
0	i feel really sick , and this food is definitely the culprit . i am disappointed because i keep giving this place chances and i always have the same experience . so done with this spot .
0	i had a rainbow roll . that was all i ate . around 230am i started having pains and started throwing up . i was stuck in my room , not enjoying vegas for the next 2 days vomiting and sitting on the toilet . never going to eat here again .
0	i went to this place for dinner the other night with a party of 7 and the waiter hid all the " better value " menu from us . instead he forced us to order the crab and lobster dinner when all we wanted was a casual meet and greet dinner . so the dishes came , and it didn 't taste horrible , however for that value you 're better off going to fisherman 's clubhouse and getting a 8lb lobster than having some crummy 4lb crayfish . honestly steer clear from this place . dishonest , and subpar food - the two things i hate .
0	2 years from previous post still waiting for panda to make corrections .
0	eat at your own risk . even the bubble tea has become bad. health inspector needs to check this place out .
0	she could not understand me on the phone either ... pretty sure it was a bad phone she was using .
0	flavorless and not worth it at all . i also try their tan tan noodle and it has the most weirdest after taste . the whole bowl of noodle was cover in chili oil . which i expect already since it 's tan tan noodle but the meat was little to none , the noodle was suppose to be their hand pull noodle as well but i would rather they serve us the generic one for half the cost . overall it 's pricy not worth it ! i could have spend less at mcdonald 's and actually gotten full .
0	some of the asian dishes didnt have any flavor . i think this company might pay for yelp reviews . dont waste your time going here .
0	over price for food that is very subpar . sushi looked like it was sitting there for days . our whole group came here for seafood and they were very disappointed . this is our third visit here and quality has gotten worse each time . my wife had a stomach that night so i have to vent . i usually don 't post such negative reviews unless it 's totally warranted . never coming back .
0	unacceptable . especially for a dish considered a " lunch special . " green tea was luke warm and not hot . server had to manage six different tables which obviously overwhelmed him . remaining orders came 45-50 minutes after we ordered and were incomplete . i don 't normally write reviews unless something is really good or extremely bad . this experience would fit the later ...
0	this was my first time going there , i complained about the service , experience they did refund my money so that was nice . not a wonderful first impression .
0	i highly recommend the kyoto house ayce just down the street . much bigger menu for $ 29 .
0	they make you pay before you eat ... prolly cuz they know it sucks . hostess made me fold up my baby stroller and had no idea where i should put it . ended up putting it underneath the table . bathrooms were gross . crab legs were tiny ... like the size of my hand . everything was lukewarm . hope i don 't get sick . go anywhere else but here .
0	way over priced . and it 's $ 6.95 if you want a little cookie on top . keep driving . too little for too much $ .
0	see photo . pathetic . the whole idea of the food court is for folks to avoid getting ripped off . two little pieces of cod and some waffle fries for $ 13 is inappropriate for a food court . and the basket didn 't even come with slaw . you pay extra for that privilege . hopefully the other establishments in the caesars food court can bring better value .
0	the crab legs are very salty and small like regular sizes and serve cold . the soups are so plain , not good , sushi is the worst , just the salads are fresh . not worth the waits either . don 't waist your money and time here . if you are asian , you can tell the asian foods are horrible ! period . don 't try .
0	3 cockroaches during dinner ... the sushi was decent but for $ 30 a person to deal with absentee waitstaff ( although apologetic ) , so-so decorating , 50 's music and 3 cockroach sightings ... definitely a place to avoid .
0	food arrived 2 hrs late . the delivery driver was the guy from the pizza place next door and didn 't know anything about the order . food was luk-warm when it arrived . the food was completely inedible . the sweet and sour chicken was disgusting . it was a neon pink color and tasted like dried out chewy dog food . beef tasted like it was bad and honestly i nearly puked after the first mouthfull . the only thing that was edible was the rice , which was average at best . there 's $ 20 down the drain . never again .
0	a rip off ! i ordered basil shrimp and got mint shrimp instead . the rice came midway through my entree after asking twice for the brown rice . one it arrived , it was dry and smelled old .
0	i found out that all the cooks when back to china and hired new cooks . stay away guys the place sucks now
0	if you are going to spend $ 100 per person go somewhere else ! ! ! ! ! !
0	they were all terrible . i think the only way this place is able to stay in business is that it is a front for something not quite legal in this state ......
0	governor 's chicken soggy , gross beef with overcooked ho fun noodles , orange colored pad thai with teeny weeny shrimp garnished with a dried brown spotted lime wedge . $ 25.85 out the door . yuck !
0	the fatty chickens aren 't juicy they are gross . they messed up my order each time . they 've parked me twice . .. to make chicken . .. ughhh that 's all they make . wtf . and , the girl on drive got mad at me because she literally had a whisper baby voice on speaker . .. like # kevinheart would say ... " say it with your chest . " 3 times ; shame on me . the only reason why i even came here was because i couldn 't do regular fast food but i didn 't want to cook or get out of my car . plus , speaking of comedians , i like # normmacdonald
0	i 've now given this place 3 tries . not going back again . the service was not good and the food was only mediocre at best .
0	3 times in a couple of weeks i work late they claim to be open till a certain time and i get their a good 30 min before closing time and they say they are closed what a joke .
0	well .... ya never made it right so here i am making it right for you . the workers there are clueless and run around the store like chickens with their heads cut off , great job guys
0	really ? tried this restaurant for the last time . much better and less expensive options available in the south charlotte area . food okay , but too expensive for what you get .
0	then another 45 minutes to make and deliver . why don 't you just start making my order when i order it ? also , you really shouldn 't offer online ordering if you don 't let customers pay online as well . very inconvenient for a mediocre sandwich .
0	great place to watch orders ahead of you leave with their food .
0	we both got large orders , but only 1 ( large ) container of rice- a negative in my book . wanted to order shrimp w snow peas , but they only do shrimp w mixed veggies , so i got pepper steak , which was very light on the sauce w denture-soft meat -- freaking gross . husband 's kung pao chicken was ... not . it was not spicy - he said it was more like mushroom veggie chicken - also grossly soft . won 't be ordering here again , or finishing this meal . gross .
0	40 min wait for a plate of chicken teriyaki ... i don 't think these people understand that they operate in an airport .
0	do not live here ! you will regret it !
0	an asian man who i think is the owner cleaned our table and disappeared . when asking the other unenthused worker who was babysitting a child if they were open he responded with an attitude your waiter will be back after 15 minutes of this nonsense we left . for me filth and sushi don 't work together . a shame was there same time last sunday and had good food with terrible service but the food was good . oh well writing this from flo 's they never suck .
0	ordered hot and sour soup and spicy won ton - pretty basic dishes . neither dish was spicy at all , and the won ton tasted like it was simply boiled in water . while a lot of dumplings are cooked that way , if done properly they dont taste so bland . since i 've eaten regularly at the scarborough location , i expected a certain level of authenticity from them here , especially being located in chinatown . but i was wrong . quite disappointing . this type of cuisine is known to have good spicy dishes , but they took out the spiciness to accommodate their mostly non asian clientele . go elsewhere if you want authenticity .
0	there is always a first time , this was my first time ever ! very little choices , food was really really bad , everything has something sweet . meats are dry and flavorless , fish dry and fishy , rice on sushi and sushi rolls are super cold dry and sweet . salads are welted and not fresh . desserts are horrible , even ice cream tasted funny . the only thing i could eat without spitting out was prime rib , it was dry but edible .
0	drove 40 minutes to be frustrated . piss poor customer service and wait times . will never give a place like this my business . only reason why they are getting 1 star is because i can 't give them 0 stars .
0	tried calling it in , but now i see why it didn 't work . even the manager is ignoring the phone .
0	the sushi here was okay and that 's me being nice . i also ordered tonkatsu , you could tell that the sauce they had for the it had a ketchup base and i can still taste the strong ketchup taste . normally tonkatsu sauce shouldn 't taste as strong as the ketchup they added to that sauce . honestly , i wouldn 't comeback and i would rather spend my money somewhere elses . the sushi here breaks and doesn 't retain it shape . the price is overpriced for what they offer . i i didn 't have anything positive to say about this place , everything was just plain lifeless in this restaurant ; the vibe , the servers , and the food .
0	4 eggrolls , thick as a chap stick and twice as long = $ 12 plate of romaine lettuce w / 4 oz of beef = $ 12 the food here is overpriced. the food itself is pretty bland. we tried 3 types of noodles , eggrolls , fried rice , " mongolian beef , " tacos. the " best " was the fried rice , but fried rice is hard to mess up. the tacos i tried were oversauced and a little undercooked. i would honestly eat at panda express or del taco before i eat at this place again .
0	2 of our iphones were stolen and the club did nothing . avoid this place .
0	came here on a friday night with a few peeps from yelp for a uye ( thanks to karl for organizing it ) . situated in the basement of the scotia plaza in the path , it was relatively easy to find . they have another location on street level right across the street so don 't get confused . the service was okay ; it would have been nice if they were a tad bit more attentive . i liked the banana tempura with ice cream , but all the maki sushi were mediocre imo . my $ 32 meal was probably to pay for the location more than anything else . eek , me thinks not , indeed .
0	i have been looking at all kinds of different ramen places in the valley and chosen this place . my boyfriend and i had the pork goyza ( 4 stars ! ) we also had the spicy ramen with the curved noodles . the soup had a very bland taste and the curved noodles were over cooked and stuck together . to top it off the pork was a gray color . i will definitely not be recommending this place or even give it another chance ! over all our server was very nice ! * * * if you are ever in the area of little tokyo in california you have to try daikokuya ! definitely 5 stars ! * * *
0	it is super small , poor service and the food isn 't anything special at all . i 've had better pad thai on the side of the road in bangkok . this place doesn 't even compare to archi 's . if you really like thai food , then don 't waste your time eating in this place because you won 't come back .
0	? ! is this for real ? why and how ! ? disgust pure disgust . 95 % of the rolls have eel sauce on them my sushi was tasteless and fell apart and was not fresh .. worst sushi i ever had ... these reviews have to be fake . i 'm starting to doubt yelp .
0	why my mom likes to go here , ill never understand .
0	ordered a dish with shrimp got chicken . wonton soup terrible. food terrible . awful awful awful . egg rolls were burnt . awful food . super disappointed
0	the food is the same kind that you can get at a $ 20 buffet . constantly ran out of food . not a lot of variety . don 't expect too much .
0	they forgot an order with our appetizers . our waiter only came to check on us at the end of our meal . one of the soups delivered to the table was the wrong one . by the time they brought the soup back , we were finished with our meal . the wonton soup was really bland and only luke warm . the service wasn 't very good , considering we only had apps and soup it took 1 hour to complete the meal service . i won 't ever return to this location , and think i might give up pf changs for good .
0	never get my $ again ! ate there , ordered to go & had it delivered . food quality is always " hit & miss . " tired of being on the missing end .
0	5.204.11 is some sort of violation involving the toilet facilities
0	the waitress had an attitude , walked up basically shoved all the dirty crap from one side to the other to make a space in the middle so we would be flanked by dirty piled up dishes . it was unsanitary , it was gross , and the waitress had a major attitude . and there was nobody in the restaurant , it was basically empty . if they can 't keep up with their business in an empty restaurant what happens when it 's full the last time we went the service was also poor , and added unsanitary conditions , we will not return
0	$ 5.50 for my $ 3.25 tea ? c 'mon guys , you have the market , why exploit is like that ? place wad clean .. ish. a little run down like the rest of the casino
0	lababdar slightly better . during weekday we have touch indian restaurant underground in the path across from staples . two to three times portion for 60 % price . same quality .
0	the egg yolk battered oysters had lobster shells in them . the male server was extremely rude--asked us to pay the bill when the last dish wasn 't even served . i actually wanted to call the manager and complain about him , but didn 't want to ruin his livelihood if he has a family to take care of . but a restaurant that tolerates his kind of behaviours and serves food that 's gone bad will not survive long . this wasn 't my first time here but will be my last time .
0	other than that , you get all ice and milk and all of the halo halo ingredients on top for presentation . you 're better off spending the same amount at seafood city . at first we thought it was a mistake , when we asked the waitress to clarify , she agreed and walked away . ha .
0	or that 's what it tastes like anyway . yummy .
0	anyone with a delivery fee that high isn 't getting a tip . guess it 's so people don 't order since apparently there are no drivers or anyone with common sense .
0	so i thought this better be the best god damn bubble tea i 've ever tasted , but nope . it was flavourless ... but hey , the tapioca was good . i must admit , the one at warden and steeles has waaay better tasting drinks than this location . don 't get me started on the service . so yes , one star for the tapioca .
0	this resulted in the rest of the line not being able to get their free tall teas . this is not good customer service . i hope management realizes how stupid this was too annoy the rest of your customers . 8 people walked out .
0	3 have fallen sick . one of my friends had to go to er . 2 of us who did not eat dipping sauce and minced meat are doing ok . please avoid the place and save your trip to hospital
0	cold and dry lo mein and grit on my chicken . also doesn 't help that a woman who must have been a manager or a veteran there was rude . no wonder this place barely had anyone there . my friends and i must have come at a bad time because our food looked nothing like what 's in everyone 's pictures . hopefully your experience was better than ours ! : )
0	food 1 star . such a shame food used to be wonderful - first time here since jet tila was chef . $ 16 martini was warm. black cod $ 30 zero flavor nothing special . i shockingly sent back cucumber seaweed salad too much vinegar and i love vinegar . very underwhelming .
0	i went with my girlfriend during the summerlicious . the guy probably didn 't want to work there anymore , because he was so bored , he was almost angry serving us . the next day , my friend went there and got the same treatment .
0	i called after placing my order online to remind them for the fifth time to include the sauce i ordered . once again they forgot . i called back and after explaining this repeated mistake to the manager and they tried to offer a credit for the next order or comp the current incomplete order . i just want my food with my sauce and they were unwilling to do that tonight . why would you let a restaurant bend you over a sixth time ? they have lost 2 dominos customers . go to benny penellos up the street and don 't waste your time here .
0	yuck ...................... ok a few more words disgusting , gross , and nasty ..
0	we don 't know what happend . the service was really bad . we saw one of the cooks eating gum . we think that is not professional . so sorry we don 't like to give 1 star but this is how we feel . i know is very hard to please everybody .
0	they seated us immediately , but did not ask us for any drinks until i flagged a waitress down after 10 minutes of waiting with no service . after we requested drinks and food i had to stand up and ask again foot our drinks at the front counter . food came quickly , but waitress never came back to us nor spoke to us again . had to stand up again to ask for bill .
0	i normally don 't order from random places on a whim but went against better judgment since it was convenient for me to pick up a quick meal on the way home so i could head back out in time for my evening plans . i ordered the beef kabob dinner - the meat was charred and dry . i 've had way better of the same stuff elsewhere . worst of all , i felt sick after eating the food resulting in frequent trips to the toilet ! horrible experience !
0	6 / 28 around 1 : 30 pm i called to place an order the lady on the phone was rude and being difficult hung up on me 2 times the second time after i placed my order i called back to ask the price and how long it was going to take and she said " sorry we can not do your order anymore " i said wow is there anyone else i can talk to she hung up on me
0	put your menu prices on the menu ! ! ! !
0	? it wasn 't even clearly marked where it was located . that level of price gouging is completely ludicrous . how on earth is it the same if not more as a specialty drink .
0	if you 're going to charge someone that much for water , let them know first .
0	i 'm seriously shocked . this is the first time i 've experienced this . all other restaurants will offer you a plate of say , 3 or 6 or even 7 pieces . just terrible . the menu needs to change . now for the cut rolls . oh the rolls are just super dinky . they look like shrunken rolls . what the heck .. they really need to beef their rolls up . i 'd say the only good thing about this place that 's good is the service , that 's it !
0	my son finished drink in 2-3 zip . will not go back again . also last time we went found a hair in soup . we done with this place .
0	6 inch sub was actually 4 inch , less meat , less vegetables , cost the same , unfriendly service , no greeting or communications , just hand you receipt even without looking at you , not to mention any greetings .
0	we came at 9 : 32pm on a friday night . the staff greeted us-and we told them 6 people in total . the server checked with the owner and stated that the only way they will serve us is if we order carry out because they already turned off the gas at 9 : 30 . if you 're supposedly open until 10pm-honor it and let people eat / drink / etc and bring you business . probably never going back to that establishment and they probably don 't care .
0	my boy friend and i barely ordered any meat and hardly got half full after spent over $ 70 . i am very impressed that they are able to charge high-end price with mediocre quality ! if they can make the business sustainable in this way , at least they show how inefficient the market is . can 't wait to see
0	6 people in the dining hall and none at the bar . ' kitchen is backed up - we won 't serve you for another hour . ' really ?
0	it comes with wet rice and a small portion of grilled vegetables . taste 2 / 5 portion 1 / 5 value 1 / 5 overall quality 1 / 5 felt like i ordered plain rice with shrimp served on the side as a poor after thought .
0	little flour taste to then . over all ok . the manager shoved me and called me am asshole after waiter spilled and broke glasses on the person i was dinning with ! he could use some anger management courses .
0	they just pulled the tea that they made earlier put ice and that 's it . and they charged 7 dollars for that . don 't waste your time and money for this place . go to a brew tea or even starbucks to get something better and cheaper and better quality . i 'm being generous with my one star
0	bad attitude of girl handling cash and food like it 's inconvenient for her to take my order .
0	i won 't make this mistake again ! ! ! save your money and find real food elsewhere
0	it was severely understaffed . took an hour ( no exaggeration ) after ordering before we even received our food . when one member of our party tried to politely say something to the doughy manager didn 't even attempt to listen and walked away from her in the middle of her sentence . terrible service . we were all late coming back to work and they offered no remorse or even the slightest courteous customer service . food was good but the service was so terrible it ruined everything . avoid at peak lunch hours as they are not prepared .
0	been going to this place for many years and yesterday 's meal was beyond disappointing . have they changed owners ? very upset that will probably have to stop eating sushi in mississauga
0	but the staff and service has pushed me to ban this from my list . i have had to walk out twice with my date after being seated at the most awkward table because of the large crowd . last time was really bad . there was a great table for three in the corner and we asked for it but the waitress gruffly pushed us into a two seat table in the middle of the room saying that they were saving it for groups of three . right after we sat down a couple came and the waitress seated them at that table although there were other two seaters available . i have had similar experiences twice and do not plan to return .
0	go away this is all we have . nice job . if you 're going to be open for another thirty eight minutes , you might want to consider making some more food .
0	arrived for dinner , only to be chased out of their empty restaurant being told they 're closing . when i pointed out they advertise a 9 : 00 pm close , they responded " fine , you can get it to go . " seriously ? ! ? there is no " customer " in customer service here . we were looking forward to trying it , but will never return .
0	that 's their health sanitation score ! eater beware . i used to love this place but they constantly have poor sanitation scores . i can 't eat here anymore , for my own gi health .
0	they sat us immediately and gave us a private room . the food was clod . very limited selection . some of the food was sitting . the sushi had no flavor . desert may be their best . it is not worth the price
0	beware . they don 't mention it at all over the phone which is illegal and try to screw you when they show up at the house . don 't order delivery or don 't even give them any business to a shady establishment like this . they just called just now saying , oh sorry that was a mistake after i told them i am gonna put this on yelp . trying to screw people over . what a joke . you guys need to be out of business
0	the spicy seafood udon also had no seafood and when we complained they only added 2 shrimps and a mussel to it . very overpriced
0	the food is tasteless . anyone who eats japanese food would be totally discussed with this chefs idea of japanese . cucumber salad terrible . tempera is totally tasteless . this chef hasn 't a clue what japanese food is or what 's it 's supposed to taste like . i am embarrassed that the public likes and more especially tourist are fooled into believing this is kabuki . everything we tried was completely tasteless and a terrible presentation . service staff was inattentive , and to worried about selling specials . did not listen to what we wanted only what he wanted to upswell .
0	no excuse . no apologies . wouldn 't give our money back . no stars
0	this places advertises they close at 10 : 00pm . i 'm shaking my head . i left because there 's nothing to choose from . i guess the employees and cook ( s ) are eager to leave and be done with their closing duties by 10 : 00pm . i 'm pissed cause i was really craving panda , instead , i have to take the time and write a poor review on this location .
0	" i asked if this was new as the hours posted say 11 : 30 , and was told that " they were closing soon , and couldn 't seat us " what incredibly poor sustainer service . doesn 't matter how good the food or drinks are if they can 't take care of people .
0	sat at this place for 2 hours for lunch . served nasty lettuce wraps after waiting for the ones they messed up , spoke with manager and he said they take 30 seconds to remake . really ? so what was the holdup to begin with ? unless you have a couple hours to spare do not plan on coming here . this is the second time this has happened . we will not be coming back .
0	never go back again ! ! cheap meat ! ! the food isn 't fresh ! ! server is good though ..
0	combos are not so cheap ( what the hell did other reviewers had for 5 bucks that was a real meal ? ) . only the portion of rice was quite generous , not that of the meal / meat / veggies . the place in addition does not look so clean , so i ate my plate rapidly , almost only thinking of the gi issue i might have in the next days ( and praying not to have food poisoning - which i did not ) . one good point = spicy food , but not very elaborated. you want indian food = try another one than this .
0	ridiculous small portions . their large size is more like small size at other teriyaki places .
0	look , i am chinese and i live in nyc . i am used to crappy service chinese restaurants , it just a part of the culture . bad service , cheap prices , great food ! right ? not at noodles - las vegas ... crappy service , extremely expensive and crappy food .... this is the trifecta of crap here , please stay away ....
0	empty tables but we can 't get seated because they 're all reserved for people who aren 't there . but we could come back at midnight ! for a group of 3 people . seriously wtf . last time we went we couldn 't get seated because they said they didn 't take reservations . don 't bother with this place !
0	if you 're going to have the audacity to charge almost ten bucks for a thai tea , it should at least taste like thai tea , if not the best thai tea ever . i didn 't try the food stalls , but if it 's anything like the overpriced drinks that taste like nothing than watered downed milk , i would say avoid this place ; there are so much better places in walking distance that 's worth your money .
0	thankfully my other favorite , kalbi saved us from running to mcdonald 's because that would 've been better.considering the money we were spending , you 'd think they would be generous with the little appetizers i got before , didn 't happen either . will i return , no , not sure whether it 's a new owner , but they need a sushi chef if the same one from my last visit 's still there .
0	a bad fusion of japanese and korean .... definitely wont come back again ....
0	prices are low because quality is just about as low , but not as low as the customer service . no one greets you or asks to take your order . very tacky establishment . the bare minimum when it comes to chinese and thai .
0	i ordered the coconut curried vegetables and my husband ordered buddha 's feast . both dishes come with tofu . the tofu was nowhere in sight . buddha 's feast had a few tiny little slivers of tofu and the curry had a few chunks . usually tofu is the main ingredient with the vegetables . i think this place is a bunch of hype . walk into any chinese restaurant in nyc and when you order a dish with tofu there is a lot of tofu . we were shocked . if you are looking for tofu " forgedabouddit "
0	this place is completely awful . the dim sum is pushed around in carts that don 't keep them hot and you know how bad dim sum is when it 's served cold . in addition , the dim sum is not prepared and cooked properly . i got a beef dish that was not suppose to have a hint of shrimp taste but did , which lead me to believe they they steam multiple dishes on the same plate . not good !
0	the food was bland , not much to go on with .... we ordered a couple of appetizers and entrées . the restaurant is set up like a cafeteria with a couple of separated enclosed booths .
0	i was not alone , 4 others came in for items all of which are allegedly ready and had the same10 minute wait .
0	it was horribly overpriced for such bland good . trying to serve ourselves was painful and elbows kept hitting each other . the house made hot sauce was really good . thank god they " allowed " us to refill our table bottle , it was poured over everything . the service was outstanding ! restaurant is embarrassingly overpriced ! ! ! ps : don 't go if you are vegetarian ! ! ! !
0	i wish this 0 stars was an option .. because that 's what it deserves . absolutely disgusting ! ! i would absolutely recommend anything any place but here
0	held an event here and it was a disaster . just an epic disaster . mains and apps coming out at the same time , people finished their entire meals before others saw any food , server disappearing for literally an hour . i have no idea why this place has a positive reputation . everyone left disappointed .
0	man , it was delicious . it was probably the best duck place that i have ever been to . however , i think they changed management and cooks . we ordered the duck and chicken again for a family get-to-gether . it was horrible . the duck was rubberry and dried inside . and , the chicken just had a horrible taste to it . thinking this was a fluke , several weeks later , we ordered half a duck and half a chicken , it was just as bad . i can 't believe that this place has gone so downhill . we will never go back to this place . yuck .
0	do you think all of your customers is stupid . when you say pork , shrimp , and crab the customer expect everything to be included not missing and say that it doesn 't come with it . you charge me extra for it , when i can just get the regular for the figure price .
0	i tried everyone 's dish and it was all very salty , i 'm guessing / hoping it was the chefs fault that night . i doubt they make every meal that loaded with salt . the service it self was okay though .
0	they closed way earlier that day and did not notify us and we did not get our food we ordered . after when we went in another day the owner confronted us and blamed it all on us . he got upset that i wrote a review on them , but that is my choice . he said he was going to make it up to us , well its almost a year and nothing yet . can you imagine we had people over for dinner and no porchetta ? not taking the chance to order there again this year .
0	food is so bland or super sweet and the hostess had such a bad attitude . if you order stuff make sure you know what it looks like before you get it . if you order takeout , they don 't give utensils .
0	1 . ordered an item . they attempted to charge me for a more expensive one . 2 . friend ordered another item , same story . 3 . repeated multiple times it 's to go , no forks . buyer beware ‼
0	the host was sitting outside on the trash can . plucked her wedgy when she got up . we found food in our hair . no one apologized or said a word when we complained they just said no english . the food was very old and bland . just sitting there for hours . they gave me one price on the phone and a different one when we got there
0	what more , beyond the title , can i say ? the menu is unimaginative , especially for vegas , and the food execution lacks depth of flavor and attention to protein temperature . every single dish ( eight in total ) was over cooked and underneath that failure of temperature was an embarrassing selection of d-grade meats . not even the poor choice of sake is worth the calorie consumption . vegas opened a new taco bell with a dj ! ! ! ! settle for that .
0	absolute bullshit , ordered food for delivery , the damn driver called me countless times and couldnt find my place somehow ... if you offer delivery , make sure your drivers can locate where they need to deliver to that is all .
0	save your money ! ! the area is in need of a good chinese restaurant until then i will hit chinatown ! ! too bad that asian star on eglinton closed down .
0	filthy and was solicited for change while eating . don 't bring loved ones anywhere near here .
0	asked for no turnips , got extra turnips , ordered a fantastic grape , got coke . in the cans . how that got mixed i don 't know . below room temp kebabs , room temp shawarma and room temp samosas . the service was rude and horrible . only got attitude about the food not being warm enough for consumption and the turnip thing . avoid this place . no idea how it 's even open .
0	from the food to the service there is nothing good about this place . it amazes me there is more then one location , but like all diseases they can spread ....
0	i don 't know what happened to this place but it 's a sad , sad , sad excuse for a sushi place . selection was better at 7-11 , many plates going around the conveyor with no cover , raw fish going around and around , all dry and warm . gross . just gross . hope i don 't get sick .
0	i ordered the original white broth which tasted stale and bordered a paste-like consistency . the single piece of pork belly had clearly been sitting in the open for some time before reaching my bowl , and the soft-boiled egg gave my mouth a bitter sensation that could only mean it had already gone bad . the decor was nice though , and the inexperienced waitress was at least polite and cheerful , but neither could stop me from giving 0 tip for the first time in my life . * forgot to mention how the presentation featured a lone piece of nori placed square in the middle , strategically covering everything else . hmm , i wonder why .
0	if you must go do not sit at the bar , they will ignore you ; you must flag one of the sushi chef down to order . the server will refuse to take your order and insists you talk to the chefs . one of them was an old man who spoke barely any english and the other seemed to just work there this past month . my second time here and both times i walked out on them without having my fair share of ayce .
0	i ended up with food poisoning and missed work and vacation . i will never return to this location again !
0	never had a worse meal in my life . i mean , you definitely get what you pay for . considering it 's dirt cheap ...
0	greeted at the door , sat for 20 minutes with just water . only 3 other tables had people sitting . wait staff walked by booth at least 6 times without even acknowledging we were sitting there . we ended up just walking out . will never return .
0	i ordered the ravioli vodka chicken , paid $ 20.76 and tipped the driver $ 5.00 . i got ravioli in sauce with no chicken . i called and asked to be compensayed with dessert . i was told i could pay for dessert and he could send chicken for me to add to a dish that was already cold . ugh .... then he hung up on me . i called back and told him he just lost a good customer and keep the chicken .
0	service is terrible . they don 't have high chairs for toddlers or even a booster seat . they can keep there stupid fancy sushi rolls and udon soup . i would never recommend this place to families .
0	the sushi we ordered does not come what we expected . extremely dissapointed ! we order both japanese sushi and chinese fried rice . the raw fish they used is not in good quality .... ... and i would recommend panda express rather than pan asia for chinese food
0	filthy from the front door to the back room . nasty dirty empty , and with good reason . horrible service and food . there is a reason this particular place is deserted . go elsewhere .
0	i went here with a group to celebrate a birthday and was served hot sake with flies in it , followed by a 40 minute wait for dirty diaper soup , which they try to pass off as a pork ramen . the waitress laughed in my face when i told her i couldn 't eat it . we ordered a sushi appetizer and barely got the roll by the time the checks were dropped . this wasn 't my first bad experience here , but it will certainly be my last .
0	we got an assortment of sushi ( takeout ) and every single piece was old , falling apart , and tasted fishy . we actually threw out most of it . i eat a lot of sushi , and i 've been to dozens of places in toronto . this is by far the worst .
0	never again .. 1100pm on a friday night , the entire kitchen staff is on break . u kidding me ! after 30 minutes , waiting to order , we left never to return . yr not the only game in town . totally disrespectful to their clients . i can 't control their behaviour , but we can determine where we go out to eat , and it won 't be pearl court .
0	the items we ordered were short of what we ordered forcing us to re order the missing items . i will never come here again .
0	it took forever to order and when the food finally came it was extremely below average . and they " accidentally " forgot to bring the plate of tuna sashimi ( the most expensive item on the menu ) . after asking the waiter about it , he said he didn 't know what happened to it . then the owner came to the table and asked me if i was sure i wanted it ! it took over 45 minutes to get what i ordered . and not everything that was on the menu was available like the shrimp toast . definitely will not be going back ! ! !
0	do not go to this place . buffet had absolutely nothing in it . lady came around and asked what i wanted . only to wait for 45 minutes and the only thing that comes out is orange chicken . guess that 's all i will have then . over priced if the only thing your going to let me eat is orange chicken . restaurant is absolutely filthy . fish tank looks like the last time it had been cleaned was when bush was still in office . if you have $ 10 and are hungry don 't go to this place .
0	everything tastes like day old fish .... and i ordered chicken .
0	going from my last visit in london park lane . nobu did not live up to the expectations . and to top it off , the manager couldn 't give 2 sh * ts ! will never come back and make sure no one i know comes .
0	this was my second visit with them in hopes that their customer service and food quality had improved , but instead of making the situation right and apologizing for the bad service they had a guy in a black suit claiming to be deputized " escort and 86 " me and my boyfriend out of the building . he told us to get the fuck out now . and the guy in the black suit tried to take my picture without my consent and tried to make me give him my id . eat here at your own peril if you want to feel unsafe . i have contacted my attorney about their verbal harassment and unlawful behavior .
0	absolutely awful food. and this is with a buy-one-get-one free coupon. even for six bucks , this was terrible. awful flavour , awful texture , awful quality of ingredients. i expect less in service at a buffet , but our server didn 't even show up to ask us if we wanted anything to drink until we were finished lunch ( and no , it wasn 't busy at all ) do not recommend .
0	i came into the restraunt on my work break and my server had absolutely no education on the menu and the items that may or may not contain gluten . matter if fact he was very wrongly informative about what he " thought " he knew . and did but waste my precious time for lunch . very disappointing . will not return
0	service ... ridiculous . they were not even busy and they let us sit with our menus menus closed for some time . food ... so not good . you know how when you are eating spaghetti and the oil is overwhelming ? yep ... that 's it . awful please please save your money . i suspect they are struggling . i wonder why ? why don 't they try and listen to the customers reviews ? here is your chance management ... email me and ask me to give you a full report .... i will be happy to help .
0	impersonal service . the vegan broth is sweet as candy . no one came by to see if we liked our food . we walked out leaving two full bowls of ramen after having paid $ 34 upfront . they didn 't notice .
0	i wouldn 't feed this slop to my dog . sent it back twice because it was cold . after watching them prepare it i understand why . they cook the meat far in advance and then put it back on the grill for a few minutes , slap some sauce on it and put it over steamed rice . nothing fresh here . move along ...
0	my friend and i wernt seated , and we waited for over 20 mins and mind you it wasn 't busy at all . we were starving so i got up and gave my order to the waitress who was pissed i approached her and i guess i interrupted her conversation with her co worker and she came by 10 mins later asking again what drinks we wanted and i re told her and after 5 mins she gave us our water which was spilt all over the table which she didn 't clean and it ran into my sleeve and it was tap water not fresh at all . food wasn 't that great , and never returning or recommending to anyone or animals .
0	good price at $ 19 per person but i would rather pay more money for better quality food and service . the service is terrible and the tables were not clean . for whatever reason they have tempura sauce in their soy sauce containers ... gross . when we asked for real soy sauce we were given a handful of soy sauce packets ... what type of sushi restaurant doesn 't have real soy sauce in a bottle ! ? the rolls were so poorly put together that they could barely be picked up without falling apart and they all taste the same . will not be returning here again .
0	we went for lunch . noodles we had were soggy like they were cooked last night . the veggies we had were dry and bitter . i wonder if it is a practice for them to buy almost expired produce . avoid this place at all costs . this place should be out of business within a year .
0	i ordered the tuna sashimi for $ 11 . i was expecting a nice serving of sashimi tuna . what was delivered to the table was 6 small slices of tuna that had been completely cooked . i asked the waiter why and he said that 's how we serve it here ... " seared . " if that is what they call seared i 'm not sure they understand the meaning . there was nothing even remotely pink about the tuna . i believe it was old . the edamame tasted like fish . we will not go back .
0	so selection . alot of poor attempts of american food and sushi is disgusting . would never waste another $ 6 there .
0	we have never had such a terrible meal .. don 't know how they stay in business as a restaurant serving food like that . we were there from 5 : 30 to 7pm and the only customers in the place . i would hate to see the place with the lights on ! ! ! even the service was only fair . don 't waste your time or money ! ! !
0	they have really gone down hill . the brown rice was more like minute rice . the teriyaki chicken was like the frozen pre-made you find in a grocery store . the pot stickers you could definitely tell they didn 't care when cooking them , they had a quick burnt fry on the bottom . never again !
0	we order food for delivery at 8 : 02pm and the email said it will be delivered between 9 : 05-9 : 15pm . it is now 9 : 49pm and my order still has not arrived . i have called the store twice and they said the driver has left . this is disgusting .
0	horrible attitude . only reason i go here is because it is the only dim sum place in vaughan . the price is expensive compared to dim sum in markham , sauga and toronto . food is decent . the grumpy old male waiters here are absolutely horrendous and are especially rude to females . probably sexist . i cant wait until there is another dim sum in the area to shut this restaurant down . not sure what their managers are doing but training staff is not one of them .
0	i guess not enough people ordered sushi , but i strictly went there for the california rolls and dumplings . i guess not anymore . the lady yelled at me when i came in asking for them saying they got rid of sushi 6 months ago and then turned around and left me standing there and never came back . and neither will i : (
0	i went on a saturday night . not crowded but a good amount inside to make me believe this place might be decent . i just moved from mesa to this side of the valley so i didn 't want to drive 30 mins to go to my usual sushi spots . won 't make that mistake again . the sushi was extremely bland and service was slow ... i sat at the bar .
0	ordered pho it arrived without the bean sprout plate which never made it to the table . the spring rolls were dripping with oil , i mean clear , greasy oil . i can be critical sometimes but i hate paying for disappointments . i just can 't let go of the greasy spring roll , terrible !
0	after getting deathly ill about 10 minutes after eating the cold crab legs ( yes , shouldn 't have risked it at a buffet ) i had to go lay down and was sick all night . then the next day i went to talk to the manager who was so rude . he asked why i didn 't say something that night .... ummmm because i was so sick i had to bolt ! and i never get sick from food . he informed me all he could do was call hotel security and file a report . complete bs . don 't go here unless you want to be sick from shitty cruise ship like food and then treated poorly .
0	no customer service . saw 3 asian men sitting around in the back watching tv . get off your ads and run your pathetic business !
0	decided to give this place a shot after some co-workers raved about it--i don 't know what they were thinking , it was horrible ! the wait staff was nice but the food was revolting ! never had calamari that tasted like deep fried a rubber chew toy , but i guess there 's a first time for everything . needless to say , i wouldn 't go back if you paid me . seriously , don 't waste your time with this place ! !
0	horrible , very small selection . had a bad stomach ache after eating here . however , the server was very friendly and attentive . nonetheless , never again .
0	i managed to stomach one plate of stale , cold chicken and they had the absolute nerve to charge me about $ 15 ! i would rather eat a pile of dog dook than eat here again , it would certainly be a healthier , safer alternative .
0	ate three bites and had to stop it was so bad . avoid this place like the plague !
0	absolutely disgusting chicken skewer cabbage roll peroggi platter 4 peroggis was pricey and horrible 40 bucks down the drain honestly the worst place i have been to in a decade
0	don 't do it ! as a chef i don 't like to give any place a bad review but this place was terrible . not only was the food bad tasting and highly questionable , the customer service was horrific . i got one of almost everything and the worst was the a chicken , how do you mess the up ? i 'll tell you how , let it go bad and then deep fry it thinking it 's going to not taste rotten ! to finish it off not even the soda was good , flat and didn 't taste like original drpepper . ugh .
0	everything was horrible. there was not a single thing that was good in this buffet . 200 choices of food my ass ! their so called mexican was the nacho bar with 2 choices of sauces . chinese was fried rice , chow mein and egg rolls. sea food was over cooked mussels and shrimp. steak was 50 % fat. the display was like a cafeteria. and my fountain drink tasted like dish water. gross ! ! ! one of the worst buffets i 've ever been to !
0	customer service was atrocious and the staff pretty much said go fuck my self when they messed up my entire order . i would never recommend this place the food was honestly so gross
0	low quality , bland and disappointing to say the least . avoid this shit hole especially on uber eats . i 'm frustrated because i was hungry and dropped my standard pretty low to get something relatively quick .. big mistake . i can 't even finish my food and i 'm still starving ! business like this should be shut down .
0	i am pretty sure the chicken wasn 't chicken . at least i didn 't get sick afterwards .
0	i came here on a friday and had insane diarrhea for 2 days . we sat right next to the open kitchen and you can see them pulling out meat and fish out of plastic containers that haven 't been refrigerated . food tastes disgusting . i got some type of pineapple cocktail that tasted like mr. freeze . this place is just horrible . very douchy , and they make you put your jacket inside of the chair-box where you are seating . which is just weird and probably not hygienic .
0	if i 'd known they weren 't going to cook it i would just have gone to the grocery store . ordered lunch , they said 10 minutes it took them 4 , meat was not cooked . had to toss it . will never go there again . only giving one star because zero is not an option .
0	i got the super crunch roll ... i took two bites and threw the rest away ... so glad i used a gift card ... the place stinks and the service sucks . run for the hills , never eat here if you like quality food !
0	i got the worst food poisoning from their disgusting fucking fish and they charged my credit card twice ! their prices are high for shitty sushi , and the ambience is depressing on top of that . if you like fishy underhanded staff and fish that will make you vomit , eat here . otherwise i suggest you don 't touch it with a 10 foot pole .
0	ive been here before and it was good . i just tried it again and got pad thai . the chicken was old and smelled and the shrimp was overcooked and not cleaned . i will never return and wouldn 't recommend it to anyone .
0	i was given a fishy salmon crab roll along with an appetizer that was basically water and cucumber . the waiter was very unfriendly so i tipped him 10 % while my girlfriend tipped 3 % , i laughed since she did a better job then i did . never come here . also , the oysters were bad .
0	my family and i came in here for dinner and it was really crowded , so we didn 't have a place to sit . however there was one table was dirty so the waitress went to go clean it for us . i saw her , with my own eyes , clean the table and do you know what she did ? she used the previous customer 's leftover water and poured it on the spinning part of the table to clean it . she didn 't even bother re-cleaning the table with some actual cleaning things either . i 'm so disgusted that the people here think that 's acceptable . do they even know what cleanliness is ?
0	quick to bring out but found it not hot and conflicting flavors on one dish and zero on the other . save your calories for another place ...
0	sorry , but i 'm being honest . i love sushi . rolls ... sashimi ... etc etc and here , it was as if i got sushi out of a vending machine . it 's hard to mess up a spicy tuna roll . i took one bite and pretty much had to spit it out . maybe the " food " is good there , but i will never go there for sushi . the staff is friendly and the place is clean . however , i wish the place that used to be in this location was still there . again , sushi out of a vending machine . ick .
0	the place smells and it is so dirty , threw the food out after we picked it up .
0	the restaurant is so dirty and you can tell they try to mask the flavour of the nasty chicken with the sauces . they give you a plate with flavourless chicken that 's probably days old and cover it with so much sauce hoping no one will notice . will never come back again , do not recommend at all
0	this place makes me want to never eat in another buffet ever again it 's hot as hell in here i am digested of the floors and tables . wish i can rate lower
0	worst sushi i ever had . these people should be ashamed for serving that kind of garbage to customers . chopped tuna sushi was repulsive . tasted as spoiled tuna covered with sauce that was horrible ... salmon roll had salmon that had skin and huge white fat veins ... this usually gets cut off and not served . avocado roll had pieces of avocado skin inside and avocado was half brown ... tasted horrible . unagi roll was just a mess of eil fat and skin . everything was horrible ... nothing good to say about this place ... avoid .
0	worst thai food i 've had in vegas . not only did it take forever to be delivered the food was bland , poorly prepared and cold . do not order from this restaurant . i 'm not sure how they 're still in business . grubhub should remove them from their distributor list , it is slandering their name . completely grossed out .
0	probably one of the worst chinese restaurant in toronto . the food is tasteless , not traditional chinese at all . we sat there for 2 hours and we were the only table in there . the waitress hard sells all the expensive food . i would rate this restaurant to be 0 stars if its possible with yelp . if you are chinese , please do not come .
0	they do not have dim sum during the week except at lunch . nowhere on any advertisements or explanations does it say that dim sum is only available at certain times . very disappointed
0	are you guys kidding me ? ! walked in , sat down , was completely disgusted , then left . i can not talk about the food , i was way to grossed out to eat it , but the restaurant itself was horrible . filth everywhere . clean it up and it 's probably a decent place . until then , nasty ...
0	made the mistake of moving one of the tables an inch while waiting for food , and there were mouse droppings underneath . young girl taking orders was very unpleasant , obviously there because her parents force her to work . food took forever , had no flavor , egg rolls were burnt . prices were very high . was told they had no ice , after i paid for , and was given , a warm bottle of water . go anywhere but here .
0	the sushi was something i 'd expect from a grocery store that 's a couple days old . both my husband and i had entrees that were swimming in sodium and msg ridden sauce overflowing off the plate . not even remotely close to what was described on the menu . felt sick for at least a day .
0	my friend got a instant noodle with meat sauce on the late night menu . the instant noodle looked like a week old and microwaved , the meat was rubbery and tasted disgusting . will never come back and highly suggest you guys not come .
0	so disappointed the orange chicken was chewy and the beef with broccoli was questionable . the wonton chips and cream cheese wonton have a weird yellow tint to them don 't know if that has to do with the flavor . shrimp fried rice was completely undercooked and inedible . the only good thing was the wonton soup .... just wondering if / how / when can i get a refund on my $ 40 .
0	the locals told me this is the best ramen place in town . well that just adds another reason why vegas sucks ! i have lived in japan so i know what real quality japanese ramen tastes like . i had their shoyu tonkatsu ramen and the noodles were half cooked and the broth was horrible . they have instant ramen at mitsuwa or greenland for vegas that tastes better than this crap ! they put 2 small slices of meat and thats it . you have to pay for an egg and any other garnish . theres only 4-5 small tables so just because theres a line outside doesn 't mean its good . will never go back to this dump !
0	from the freezer burnt , cold , precut tiny snow crab legs to the way over done fish , the maki that had obviously been sitting for quite a while . i do realize this is a buffet and not everything will be perfect but i do at least want to find something good . i do not recommend this to anyone .
0	my family comes here a few times a year , and each time we come , we 're actually surprised by how dreadful the experience is . expect to be waiting for ages for drink orders and your waiter will seldom check on you . that said , the food is pretty food--if you ever get it .
0	i wouldn 't even say the food was fish-stick grade , much less sushi grade . the wasabi was bland , my salmon roll was warm ' fishy ' smelling and the order came out so fast i swear it had to have been pre-made . if they offered me free sushi for life i still would never go back . never . yuck !
0	absolutely hate this place ！ too many rules ！ it seems like eat in a prison ！ one of the female waiters is so so rude ... this is the 【 first time 】 and 【 last time 】 to eat in this bbq restaurant ！
0	bought their food from postmates and i got so sick ! somehow the chicken is doused in sauce yet has no flavor whatsoever . that should 've been my first warning sign . the cream cheese wontons are exactly that , just hot cream cheese . not even onion or imitation crab , stuffed in a dry wrapper . i normally don 't bother writing reviews , but i figured i should save someone else from getting violently ill from this place like i did .
0	first time i ordered they got the order wrong and offered nothing in return . ordered a second time because the driver at least apologized . this time was worse . not only were they way late , but when i called to politely ask on the status of my order , the guy who answered the phone proceeded to tell that it wasn 't him who took my order and then hung up on me . all i can say about the couple times i sincerely tried , with patience , is rude , rude and very rude . hope they flop .
0	the food kept us coming back , but that 's not even enough anymore . we waited an hour and a half for our takeout , only to return home and half of the order was missing . we tried to call back , but since they are incapable of picking up a phone we had to walk back . the girl at the front was rude when we explained the problem . she just handed us the rest of the order without even apologizing . we have been a customer for 2 years on a weekly basis and will find a new thai place in toronto .
0	i passed by this place on a daily basis when commuting to work , so today i decided to walk in and ask for a ramen menu since the big banner outside looked extremely delicious . the waitresses seemed friendly when they handed me the menu but i heard her say " mendokusai " under her breath after i returned the menu . めんどくさい " mendokusai " means something that requires effort but you don 't feel like doing or dislike doing for whatever reason ; bothersome . are you kidding me ? ! just because i spoke english to you , it does not mean you can say sh * t in front of my face hoping i don 't f * * king understand ? !
0	we sat with table cloths around our shoulders because it was so cold . the chicken was sub-par as was the service . we were a party of 13 and they were unable or unwilling to separate the bill , however , they did separate for two but did not subtract the amounts paid from the total bill . better places to try when in vegas .
0	we first tried to call to place an order and no one picks up their phone . we decided to just drive there and ended up waiting well over an hour for an order of 10 chicken wings and a waffle , which was twice the time we were quoted . greasy and dirty place with zero customer service , and every area had grease or trash on it . every employee was also remarkably unfriendly . prices were good but it was not worthwhile , and the food was dripping with grease ( and not in a good way ) . super unpleasant experience . do not waste your time .
0	we asked to have some tables rearranged to better seat our large group but the head waiter angrily resisted . he eventually obliged but not before going on an angry rant about how it was a burden for him . we were only one of three groups in the restaurant that night and it was practically deserted . it could not have been too great of a burden for him . the same waiter also hurried us out to pay the bill and leave . the average food does not justify such rude service . will not eat here again !
0	absolutely horrible , called to order to go and told them i 'd call back , called about a dozen times no answer finally answered 3 hours later to take my order , what i ended up with was gyoza with no sauce , all the sushi was practically falling apart , no sauce or topping on one of my sexy rolls , 3 packets of soy sauce for 10 rolls of sushi , one pair of chop sticks too .
0	called earlier this week to to book an appointment with a groupon , and they said to not buy the groupon but that they would honor the same price so groupon didn 't take their cut . a bit odd , i 've never been asked to do that before , but okay . contacted them today to confirm , and they refused to honor the groupon price and canceled my appointment ! said i could keep the same appointment day and time if i paid more than the groupon price . no thank you - found another salon . should have read these reviews first !
0	dry as it can get and i found a huge piece of shrimp in my soup and i hate seafood , they never mentioned it at all or gave me a choice.i drove all the way to westlake from sheffield because thai chili in avon lake is closed until late january.this place is a complete joke , try thai chili and you 'll see what authentic great thai food is.never again ugh
0	had the eggplant dried noodle , and it was just one slimy horrendous mess . took few bites and almost threw up . waste of time and money .
0	i order here all the time ... haven 't moved and all of a sudden they don 't deliver to my address . the girl on the phone taking the order was either deaf or couldn 't speak english . i had to repeat everything 5 times only to be told they don 't deliver to my address of which they have been delivering to for the last three years . oh well ... you just lost a loyal customer .
0	on july 10 my family dined here , i regret it and won 't return . their exhaust system in the kitchen broke and the entire dining room was full of exhaust smoke . it is a health hazard to breath that and it is a fire hazard also . their women 's restroom was disgusting . garbage overflowing , no toilet paper or paper towels . i have ate here several times but won 't return after this visit . i wasted $ 35 on a un-enjoyable experience . the owner was present that night , he should have had the integrity of a business owner to close for the night .
0	ordered food via ubereats . spinach salad was expired ( smelled like ammonia ) portion sizes were mediocre , ketchup was expired .. what the hell is going on ? wheres the integrity ? food quality ? so i 'm assuming if something is expired then its ok to serve it if its a delivery , or if the customer doesnt know about it . absolutely ridiculous , i do not recommend this place at all .
0	also felt sick immediately . nothing was properly cooked . worst chinese food
0	absolutely horrible. food came fast .. ordered fried wantons. were way over cooked. pork was jerky. oil was old tasting. pork egg rolls were the worst i have tasted , maybe the oil. they forgot the fried rice. cashew chicken ... yes 2 items. paper chicken was no flavor .. was mushy. how can chicken be mushy ? soup egg drop was ok. once you added salt. never order from here again. ever. was told it was new manager .. obviously not good one ..
0	i upset my stomach and very pricy compare to the quality of food . i regret i ruined my birthday in this terrible place !
0	absolutely horrible , fried won tons were soggy not crispy , chow fun soggy overcooked vegies and shrimp ... chicken wings tiny and old tasting ... i would never order again from this place ...
0	greasiest chinese food i 've ever had . i have never seen vegetables covered in so much oil in my life ! food came out cold . sign out front said $ 15.99 and they charged me $ 17.99 + tax . do not go ! you will regret it !
0	driest food i have ever had . the entire thing was just a huge disappointment .
0	it was sitting there waiting to be served . also , their alaska roll did not seem like it had any salmon . i am not usually a picky eater , but this place is a sad excuse of a restaurant .
0	i will never be patronizing this restaurant again . ordered delivery on a sunday evening . food was terribly bland & they forgot my rice & noodles . when i notified them of the error , they asked if i would come pick it up . i explained i couldn 't . i then proceeded to wait over 40 minutes for them to deliver the missing rice . ( never got the noodles ) customer service is severely lacking . did i mention how bad the food was ? be warned .
0	the only reason why i come to this location is because it 's down the street . the first time i had an incident was because i had got frozen honey walnut shrimp and broke a chipped tooth
0	they accept call ahead reservations , get you there then tell you it will be a 45 minute wait . food is cheap for a reason , service is awful . buyer beware - you get what you pay for .
0	never gets the order right . always missing something in the damn bag . last time i ordered something i checked my bag before driving off and they got rude with me since there was a long line . ( the hell was i moving because once again you forgot something in the damn bag ! ) remember ! always check your bag before driving off ! or else you 'll be waiting in a long line to get your correct order !
0	my husband was spitting out pieces of chicken that were rubbery and i could only eat part of mine due to the frost bite on my chicken . pei wei is better and half the price .
0	the only good thing is the friendly waitress . i m never going back there .
0	one of my individual 's ordered food from here for delivery . about 3 hours later he informed me that his food hadn 't come . i called the place and the person who answered the phone said the chef didn 't receive his order and it hadn 't even been made yet . i asked for the manager 's name because she wasn 't there and he refused to give it to me . i sent them an email on their website and i never got a response . my poor guy was waiting for hours and by then time his food got here he had already missed his lunch .
0	purchased lunch take out on christmas eve for myself & daughter , the rice was old , orange chicken was dry , & the house lo-main was awful , after 2 bites i decided it was a complete loss . i would not allow my daughter to taste the food . i took pictures ( will attempt to attach ) and tossed the food $ 18 + , in the trash . lesson learned
0	magically , after paying , they no longer have the individual meal so my husband is not getting the crab ragoon , soup and egg roll with my 3 individual dinners that was ordered . didn 't get the fried rice for one of the dinners they told my husband 48.08 and charged my card 58.67 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! when i called , they were rude and acted like i was the issue . while i was dealing with them , i found hair fried / stuck to my sweet and sour chicken ! ! ! ! i am repulsed . will not ever order from here again .
0	do not eat here . there are better options .
0	i made the unfortunate mistake of trying this place without consulting yelp . after doing some research , i found out that this restaurant , the owner , and staff discriminated against a disabled couple and their service dogs ... i will never eat here again .
0	as someone who worked at a restaurant for numerous years , i am usually lenient and understanding . but the service was absolutely horrible . we waited 2 hours for our food . once it came finally , we waited another hour for our checks ( after asking for them immediately ) . after speaking with a manager , we had to finally go up to the register to check out ( 30 mins later ) . we left at midnight . no one ever came to apologize .
0	didnt pick up the phone for 15mins . then went there to order , took 10mins to take order . after that have to wait for 35mins to get my food . and all that for a dinner quantity equal to lunch quantity . better to avoid this spot and head to krua thai .
0	food took over 1.5 hours as they are obviously understaffed . they have one guy running around making milkshakes , operating the cash register , taking orders and serving , and one more person in the back trying to cook . when i went , there were about 20 hungry customers who all looked annoyed and fed up . toppings was great at their old location but i 'll never return to the new one . management really needs to get their act together .
0	i ordered a mac jr meal and waited in line to get it only to have some other customer come in and order the same thing except they told the employee they were in a rush , then i watched as my meal was given to them , so i had to wait another ten minutes while this customer that was in such a rush sits down and enjoys their meal . this is why you will never be paid $ 20 / hr
0	just awful ! they weren 't that busy but it took 5 minutes just to be sat . once sat we had to ask for drinks . and we never did order dinner because after about 15 minutes and the manager telling us " i 'll be right back to get your order " we left . i 'll never go back .
0	ordered from here brought it home and the containers were not closed properly and all the food fell into the bag . called and spoke with the owner and was told to return back to them . when i suggested i did not have the time too she didn 't even offer to drop off more by delivery . i 've read the reviews about the place . they must all be completed by there friends . good luck here ! i would never recommend this place to no one ! !
0	over an hour and a half for delivery and they still never showed up . no management and nobody gives a shit . they should be embarrassed to even be in business . avoid this place like the plague . i 'd give them a negative 20 stars if i could . this place is horrible ! ! ! ! !
0	please be advised , do not go there unless you want to waste your time , money and the opportunity to eat good food . stay away ! !
0	quoted one hour eta & it took them 2.5 + hours to change a tire . once my car was ( finally ) put up , i see the associates just standing around and goofing off instead of actually changing a tire . i strongly recommend that you go anywhere else to get new tires . lesson learned . those particular associates need to be in a different business ( i.e. fired ) as well because their customer service was horrid .
0	the restaurant was mostly empty , but it still took 15 minutes to place an order . the food we got wasn 't correct , and took forever as well . there is better asian cuisine in kent , do not recommend .
0	she seemed very lost and i gave it to her two times and when i told her she needed to put the expiration date in she said " no i don 't " poor customer service . will never call again very frustarting ! ! !
0	i ordered 2 sweet and sour dishes and the delivered no sweet and sour sauce . when i called they argued that they did put the sauce in . why would i lie about sweet and sour sauce ? ? ? if you are thinking about ordering from this establishment .. don 't ! ! !
0	waited an hour and a half for delivery . called and they said the driver left 30 mins ago . i am only 1 mile from them . called again and they said they would call the driver . waited 15 more mins and called back to cancel the order . they just said ok and hung up . will never order from this place again . don 't waste your time unless you don 't really want to eat .
0	waiters are rude . they got our order wrong and the food was below average . don 't waste your time and money !
0	went there as we were starving ! sat ourselves at a table and noone came to see us of take our order . we literally sat for 20 mins and decided to get up and leave . the waitresses were to busy checking their phones , chit chatting , and loafting behind the cash . will never recommend this disgraceful place to anyone else ! they don 't even deserve 1 star . ps waitresses saw us get up and didnt even care to ask us why or what happened .
0	the food is so subpar and very overpriced . thy charged us $ 10 for a small side of rice ! the experience was very boring and not worth the high price at all .
0	the food was bland and hard to cut through . the rice was bad . the ribs were bad . the sweet-and-sour pork tasted and felt like gristle . we ended up sending two meals back and leaving without finishing our dinner . prices are exorbitant . diner beware !
0	their egg rolls were insanely greasy and so were their pork chop thing ... can 't remember the exact name of the dish . my fiancé tried their ox tail soup and said that it was just so so .... don 't feel like writing more .. feels like m wasting my time ... but u got the idea right ?
0	the only good thing they had was the roast beef , and it was cold . how can you go wrong with hot and sour soup ? i have no clue , but they do . none of the " chinese " offerings are any good , and slim pickings at that . last time i was there a thai friend recommended it and it was delicious , but that was about 10 years ago . things sure have changed . i was embarrassed that i told my friend they were really good . don 't waste your time and money . awful ! ! ! yelp asks : good for : nothing
0	the reviews for this place are completely bogus and must have been paid for . we ordered four dishes from here that were all equally horrible and partially uncooked . i would never come back here and waste my time or money even if i was paid to . absolutely disgusting .
0	the servers were stupid and distracted . i seriously questioned where they were and what they were doing . one of them was dressed like she just rolled out of bed . the service was slow and unreliable , i was sat at a table that had not yet been cleaned . ( there were still other peoples dishes and dirty napkins on it . horrible experience . i had to leave it was so bad . their tea selection is vast but not good . i 'm assuming there was some artificial flavours as well . not a very nice place to be , don 't go .
0	we were there for 20 minutes without service , menus or a greeting . i had to ask for a menu , had to ask for everything ! it ruined my husband 's and i 10th anniversary . being that we have so many children we only get to dine out once a year if our budget allows . the food was presented well however the sushi was still half frozen . we were ignored the whole time . never going back . and you shouldn 't either . just a fair warning to my beloved yelp community .
0	we were told the two entrees we ordered were not available ( 20 minutes after we ordered ) . our backup orders were average at best , and not nearly spicey enough ) . only saving grace was that the server was good , but way overworked ( 1 waiter for the whole restaurant ) . we will never go again
0	absolutely horrid. the atmosphere is nice but if you 're looking for good thai food , this definitely isn 't the place. basil chicken hardly had any chicken in it and the general tsos chicken was raw in some spots. never going again .
0	we ordered here because of a flier on our door and they deliver . the main dishes were ok , it 's hard to mess up sweet and sour and teriyaki . the fried rice was the worst i 've ever had , i can 't believe they even choose to send this out . the crab puffs were hard and soggy at the same time and the filling was just philadelphia cream cheese alone . the eggs rolls had a tolerable texture but were almost bitter in taste . after waiting for over an hour for delivery this meal was terribly disappointing ! we will never order here again ! !
0	we waited 15 minutes just to get water , over 20 for soy sauce ( which we never got ) spent 60 $ for 3 disgusting rolls . save your money , we were excited for sushi in vegas . i would have rather spent 60 gambling and lost it all . this place should be out of business already .
0	i just got back with lunch , i bite into the sandwich and this absolutely disgusting giant gooey , rubbery tendon like thing is there . i have never been more grossed out . see picture . so long for chicken .
0	absolutely lethargic , inexcusable and pathetic service , take ur money somewhere else , after 20 mins of waiting t the table there was no sign if service , even after complaining to the person in charge nothing changed , seriously expect people to shell $ 16 per dish with this sort if sloppy service .. one of our worst experiences at a thai restaurant ever .
0	the waiter doesn 't even offer a greeting just rudely asks what we want and then quickly walks away before we can finish what we 're saying . food is just ok . decor is outdated . definitely will not come back here . good luck getting the checked . waved down the server but they ignored us . not that we wanted to pay for this awful experience .
0	only possible thing to get is fruit . service is terrible , we 've been waiting for at least 45 minutes for fruit and two crepes . overall , we won 't be back to this place . not only have we been waiting over an hour now , but the staff isn 't all too friendly . clearly they are trying but unfortunately , not succeeding .
0	it is a pretentious over-priced restaurant serving mostly chinese-like dishes . the very big menu indicates an unimaginative kitchen crew . the egg rolls are very greasy , dry , bland , and almost charred ! many of the dipping sauces are painfully sweet . the sushi , if one could call it that , is choked in undercooked small grain rice . if you want fusion , go to soba . if you want sushi , go to umi . if you want thai , go to thai gourmet or thai tamarind or smiling banana .
0	the service is very slow and lousy , it was not busy period . we don 't recommend it . we will never come back unless they change to different thai chef .
0	the worst chinese food i 've had in a long time . we got the sweet n sour soup - it was neither sweet or sour . no flavor at all ! brother had to doctor it up himself at the table . it didn 't work out . salt / pepper shrimp ( no shell ) was super salty ! the duck tasted overly game-y . spring rolls had no meat - only cabbage ( hello , cheap ! and no flavor ) . pork fried rice was the only edible thing we got . service was good - thus one star . pass on this place . ridiculous .
0	absolutely not consumable , so salty so msg we left 90 % of what we ordered ... very upset , very disappointed
0	overpriced basic sushi . don 't believe the hype . there are plenty of other ways to lose money in vegas ...
0	stay away ..... was there on 01 / 07 , place an order , git my pho , then all of a sudden ...... i looked down and saw something float to the top of the bowl ..... a damn roach ! ! ! ! ! ! ! avoid this establishment ! ! ! !
0	the night i stopped in for take out .. i proceeded thru the fix ur bowl line as per normal , but to discover this frozen weird looking assortment of meat ? no shrimp ... i opted for the cod . i was happy with the veggie assortment and i made the ' spicy sauce ' recipe as the sign indicated . i thought $ 8.50 for a take out box that wasn 't full was a bit pricey . when i finally got it home , i couldn 't finish it , it was that awful . guess i will drive across town to my fav mongolian bbq in tempe the next time i get the urge for that !
0	the food was luke warm , most of the meat dishes were well over cooked or burnt . every dish tried was so bland it didn 't matter if you were eating chicken and broccoli or the house special which was a spicy chicken , they both tasted the same ! the squid was so over cooked you couldn 't even chew it , the mussels had a home made spicy sauce that was labeled spicy but was as sweet as the orange chicken . if i was rich and bored i 'd pay people not to eat here , it is that bad . below average , even for a buffett .... please save yourself and do not eat here !
0	literally no customers except the ones picking up take out . we sat waiting for our order for over 50 minutes until i complained and they started making it . the quality of the fish is acceptable , but going out of the way to this area and then waiting an unacceptable amount of time , turned me off this place immediately . you can find comparable quality of fish in other parts of the city without being treated poorly .
0	food didn 't tasted horrible , almost tasted like something my toddler would try to make for me on her easy bake oven . actually the easy bake oven probably tasted better . servers had a attitude like he was better than anyone else . also later figured out that this place was featured on dirty dining for slime on their food or utensils . disgusting . i would not want to come to this place again . even for those who are filipino , don 't go here or you 'll end up leaving and head straight to the er .
0	ordered home delivery via skipthedishes and after a wait of 1 : 30 hours got served stale meat and food . had to discard almost 50 $ worth food . have officially filed a complained with the health and safety department . when i called in the owner he started yelling " do what you want . " do yourselves afavor and skip this restaurant at all costs .
0	i get that this place has cheaper prices , but the ingredients are trash . the chicken isn 't even real , its processed and slimy and is like biting through rubber . the rice tastes like they just poured it out of the friggin bag and there was no seasoning at all on anything that touched a wok . for $ 16 i could have walked to the giant eagle next door , made better chinese food and saved four dollars . bland color and bland taste . if you like eating plastic then order food here and shove a chopstick in your eye so the pain distracts you from this god awful food .
0	absolutely pointless with no crab legs just another underwhelming asian buffet with mediocre at best food
0	absolutely , positively some of the worst food i have ever had .. i was not at this location .. i was at their downtown location so this is the location i am specifically referring to , but i can 't imagine any of them could be any better .. i have been nauseated for the past three hours after eating their food .. not much more to say other then terrible .. save yourself and don 't waste your time or money .. think i 'm going to go throw up now just so i can feel better ..
0	asked for table for four looking at at least 8 empty tables for more than four people . instead of taking 2 chairs from a 6 top they told us there was a 20 min wait . when i referred to the empty tables she waved a paper in front of my face yelling she had many reservations . they will never see me again .
0	i don 't care how good you think the food is ( it 's not that great ) - the customers service is abysmal . i am disgusted . this place is destined for failure . for a supervisor to speak to a client in such a manner is shocking ... 0 stars was not an option .
0	she also hung up on us mid order , then called us back about 20 minutes later saying the part of what we had ordered was ready . we told them never mind because they were rude to us and they weren 't even sincere with their apology . i 've been here before and the food is not that great . we won 't be back . i wouldn 't recommend going here unless you want rude service .
0	way overpriced for something that is worse than what you can get on a street . i came here while we were staying at the wynn and we ordered 2 dishes even though we were super hungry though we would rather starve than eating here . the panang curry should have been named the super disgusting union curry which bombarded with oil . the chicken drunken noodles were not even worth 5 dollars . save money . the only reason that i am giving it one star is because of the chandelier . never eat here ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	limited food options for lunch , and my $ 24 bento box was something that tasted like it had been pulled from the nearest dumpster .
0	" bxtch " is probably a suitable terms to describe these two waitress / hostess . food is mediocre . meat was too fatty and unhealthy . i personally would not pick to come back to this restaurant because they hire very shitty and " rude " waitresses . do not go .
0	not even a fortune cookie with lunch . we order the jakarta satay w / noodles . over drenched in sauce .. not the least bit spicey , and next to no meat or vegetables ... mainly noodles . many other chinese places in the are would be better than this .
0	1 out of 10 is more like it .. wish i could turn back time and eat anything but this bad bad bad sushi . one piece of yellowfin sashimi looked like a piece of smoked salmon . sitting out all day probably and forming a thick " crust . " gross . hopefully some of my fellow sushi lovers see this review and save themselves a terrible experience . saki wasn 't bad though .
0	absolutely terrible , ate here tonight at about 7 and by midnight i was vomitting disgusting undigested panda , i would likely attribute it to the poor cleanliness of the restaurant , i will never ever be returning
0	i had the shrimp in lobster sauce and the sauce was brown instead of white like it should be . i will never order from this place again . really bad food , such a disappointment .
0	came here because it had good reviews somehow . the sushi is extremely expensive and the rolls are tiny . the restaurant was mostly empty , yet it took them 30 minutes to make our sushi . my friend got the sushimi salad and she was the last one in our group to get her meal . it had 3 slabs of sushimi on it and a handful of lettuce and a tomato slice . do not go here .
0	brandee the cashier took five minutes for every person trying to order . the staff were absolutely unhappy and slow . pei wei should pull this franchise from this owner . absolutely terrible for their brand .
0	i waited for someone to help me for almost 10 minutes before i started yelling for help . truly unbelievable .
0	my friend lost his wallet over the weekend and we called to see if they had possibly found it . when i asked over the phone , the worker stated that we cannot call to ask to if they found the wallet . he ( the worker named ray ) then repeated that i shouldn 't call again and refused to give the phone to a manager . as a greek american , this place leaves me embarrassed to be associated to this establishment .
0	the staff answering the phone has no clue what 's going on . do yourself a favor and go somewhere else .
0	this place is a dump , but i figured they must have such great food that people keep coming back regardless of what it looks like inside . not only was the food disgusting , but i also got food poisoning from eating there . within an hour of leaving i started getting headaches , feeling cramped up , vomiting and enjoying frequent bouts of diarrhea . thanks la pete , i will never come back ever again . the only reason i gave it 1 star is because i can 't give it zero
0	don 't punish yourself by eating here . after experiencing a health code violation i will never return here . the food preparation is sloppy , and there 's dramatic variation in quality and consistency of product . they would rather focus on rationing napkins and ketchup than be in any way concerned about your food . the only good thing about this place is the friendly lady at the drive-through window . this review is made after having been to the restaurant several times . at some point , convenience just isn 't worth it .
0	instead they brought something with milled salmon and when we asked about it , we were told a few things - 1. the milled salmon is quicker , 2. there 's a new sushi chef who can 't wrap the salmon around and 3. they never had it with the fresh salmon ( even though it 's pictured on their menu ) the waitress was not pleasant or happy and ignored us most of the time ( we were there for lunch during the week - it was not busy so there 's really no excuse ) it cost over $ 20 for 2 rolls of sushi not sure how they even manage to stay open
0	everytime we get takeout from here something is missing how hard is it to put the rice in the bag ? ? ? now we have a plate of chicken with no side whatsoever and my girlfriend is cooking her own rice and all the kid did on the phone was laugh and say we will get you next time absolutely terrible food sucks too just thought we would give it a try since they changed their name but still same owner and terrible food and
0	they shoved my entire meal into a small take out container that could hold no more then a muffin ... this place is a sad place if they think they can serve food like this ... awful and ontop of it you cannot get the restaurant on the phone ...
0	ordered in for valentines day - food arrived 2 hours late . food was very spicy even though we asked for mild and the manager had a lot of attitude when i called to complain . food was so bad we had to ask for a refund . would not recommend
0	the general tso 's checken wasn 't chcken , and didn 't taste like the general had been anywhere near it . the teriyaki chicken was cardboard . as other reviewers have mentioned , the food comes out in 5 minutes . however , other reviewers have glossed over the fact that food should take more than 5 minutes to prepare . please avoid this place as if your life depended on it .... because it might .
0	food was sub-par , customer service was terrible . asked for the bill and it came 15 mins later .. meanwhile we could see one of the servers was on her phone . food wasn 't worth the price at all .
0	absolutely terrible food , you might as well just eat a whole bag of sugar and salt while you 're at it
0	horribly sloooooow service when the restuarant is dead . servers who don 't pay attention. and it smells funny . no thanks
0	i honestly can 't even figure out why they 're still open . three people got the all you can eat . the waitress was extremely rude , her name was hee . she messed up our orders , and it took forever for everything to come out we ended up only getting 3 orders before they put the bill on our table after killing so much time on the order before having it come out . we probably waited 20 minutes for 1 roll to come out . when it came time to pay they also messed this up and couldn 't figure out how to split a bill . this was absolutely terrible . do not go .
0	i ordered a beef lo mein from them . it was ready surprisingly fast . but it was heavy and warm . when i got home , i opened the box to find a pile of noodles with some barely cooked vegetables and less than 20 grams of beef . the beef quality is also poor - i couldn 't chew through half of it . not sure if foreigners know this , but lo mein means sauced noodles ... i didn 't find much sauce in my noodles either . this restaurant is an embarrassment to chinese food . i won 't come here again . instead , i 'll go to perfect kitchen when i 'm in the neighbourhood .
0	i paid almost $ 6 for an order of medium sized fries . when i took it out of the bag to eat i realized it was reheated old fries . they were so hard and chewy i had to throw it out after the second bite . would not recommend this place .
0	i wanted to try something new . first and last time i ever eat here . the delivery driver was nice . other than that , the food was uncooked and cold . my mozzarella sticks we 're literally hard in the center . definitely not worth the money . grande pizza is 100 times better i will only order from there from now on
0	i have this one chick 's number saved in my phone as " you a fool if you answer " and i can honestly say you a fool if you go to this craptastic excuse for a restaurant .
0	only gets one star because there isn 't a no-star option . ordered delivery from these guys and the driver was an hour and a half late , with nothing to say for himself but " it was busy . " all the food was stone cold . when i called the restaurant to tell them what happened , they offered me a discount for my next order , which i guess seemed reasonable to them but why would i order from them again ? even if the food was hot , it would be mediocre at best . never giving this place my custom again .
0	ordered to go . tuna poke was drenched in spicy mayo . i could hardly taste the tuna while i was eating pieces of tuna . the salmon cannolia portion was pathetically petite . the host also managed to be both awkward and rude . in sum : overpriced bullshit
0	rice was seriously lacking in flavor . brown sauce in the chicken in broccoli was very thin and lacking in flavor . the chicken tasted boiled . veggies were over done . honey chicken was overdone . delivery was quick but now i see why . never order from here again .
0	i tried this takeaway three times to give it a chance to improve but the chicken was stale , the chips were dripping wet and soggy and the ' meat ' spring rolls had no meat anywhere to be seen . avoid this place at all costs ! the sun do is just down the road and is fantastic !
0	i 'm currently sitting here , waiting for my food . it 's been about 30 minutes at least and more than 10 orders have been called and ready before mine . don 't waste your time with this sub-par food and crap service .
0	i went here for lunch with my brother and gf on a sunday afternoon and it was outrageous . there was only one waitress working the entire restauratn . we waited 20 mins to sit down , which wasn 't bad , but once we sat it took the waitress 20 min to take our orders ... and then she only brought 1 of the 3 rolls , one salad and we had to then remind her twice about the other things we ordered . our drinks were never filled and it took them forever to do anything . i wish i could say the rolls were delicious but they were full of rice with hardly any fish . not worth the price or the hassle ...
0	and it was from the owner non the less . i went in for my sandwich three times and they were not finished each time . they took about 30 to 40 min to make 1 9in . sub . and then the owner walked over to my job next door and right in front of me dropped the sandwich on the counter . didn 't even say your welcome . save yourself the money ! a five dollar footling from subway is more worth it .
0	they stop serving customers coming in to get a table forty five minutes prior to close . they have zero manners . they also returned my tip at the end of the night because they weren 't satisfied with the amount . given how terrible their service was , they 're lucky i even gave them one cent . lastly , the food is mediocre at best and the portions don 't make sense with the price . i will never be coming back here again . it beats my how this place is still open at downtown summerlin . it 's the black eye of the area .
0	we made a lunch time order and picked it up , but we were disappointed to find 2 employees were missing their lunch . unfortunately with them being so far away , we were unable to go all the way back inside our lunch hour . we called later to let them know what had happened . the owner was extremely confrontational , and went as far as calling me back to argue and accuse more . we will never do business with this business again . not how you treat good customers .
0	the flavored sake tastes like a moscato you could buy at walgreens . the service was rude and pushy . the meal itself was mediocre compared to the price . in short , the service was absolutely terrible . if you want a meal ruined by the service , then come here . if you want a real meal and good service , go somewhere else . do not waste your time and money .
0	the rice tasted like wallpaper paste . the 2 dishes i had just weren 't good and it cost a ridiculous $ 9.40 . never again .
0	in fact i 'm looking at my package of peanut butter crackers and thinking that would have been more satisfying . had the chili relleno , the chili inside was not even prepared properly because it was hard and stringy , then they stuffed it with processed american cheese and coated it with a flavorless breading . i also had the chinese pork ... blah . chicken fried rice ... blak and cold. refired beans and cheese ... cold . if you like cheap bad food go here !
0	waited four hours for groceries to be delivered because delivery driver called wrong number when delivering . they were given the apartment number and told it was ok to leave at the door . instead driver leaves with no attempt to contact . absolute incompetence , pizza hut must not be hiring drivers .
0	the entry way was filthy . the service upon arriving was horrible . the floor is covered in fifth , because apparently the staff does nothing here . the food is unmarked so we didn 't know what anything was . i can 't say much to the taste of anything because the appearance was enough for me . we asked for a refund and left immediately ! i will not be returning to this place again .
0	in other words " an absolute dive " ! arrived 15 minutes after opening for lunch , the temperature in the place was at best , 60 degrees . wait staff doesn 't understand or speak english ... food is horrible ... management is rude . most noteworthy , the place is filthy and should be inspected and closed down !
0	person on the phone said 20 mins . thought that was unreasonable , but ok . will give it 40 mins . 90 mins latter ! i called them , " it 's on its way . " another 30 mins , called back and cancelled order . i understand it 's a friday night , busy busy busy . but you have to be reasonable on delivery time . especially on a order of 50 $ plus . person on the phone was short and long on attitude . i absolutely hate stiffing a delivery guy their tip , i know how hard it is . ripped up the menu . never again .
0	the pho is acceptable . the pork chop is frozen dried jerky that is over brined and salted . the pork spring roll is not freshly made .
0	i did nothing wrong then i had to go back to work with no food because you wasted my whole lunch .
0	do yourself a favor and eat frozen mac n cheese before you go to this place ! my mother and i complained that everything was cold or just plain bad .... the manager / owner yelled at us because we told him there was no way we were going to eat any of his food let alone pay for it . he literally screamed at us that whether we ate or not we still had to pay . avoid at all costs !
0	i just wasted 30 $ of hard earned money . they also made a big mistake with my order . i ordered 2 of the combos that are supposed to come with wonton soup and rice . they delivered the principal plates instead which were more expensive and i did not get any rice or soup and when i called to let them know they refused to fix it . the beef broccoli had a strange smell to it and the beef was grey . the poulet ananas looked like it was deep fried 2 days ago and then just reheated and it had a very small amount of sauce and burnt pinapple chunks . would not recommend .
0	chicken curry was tasteless soup the same . never again
0	i ordered the kung pao vegetables for takeout and it was basically just hard broccoli and other vegetables swimming in the most watery liquid . wasn 't even spicy . service was also bad , i guess i went in on a day where everyone was pissed off but i will not be back for a second chance . thanks for the undercooked veggies and boiling water .
0	i will never set foot in this place ever again . i had to throw away more than half the dish because it was inedible .
0	i drove 20 minutes because the reviews were better than those of other chinese places in concord and figured it 's pretty hard to mess up veggie lo mein and hot ' n sour soup . wrong . in addition to having an old , almost stale taste ( if this is even possible with soup ) , the hot ' n sour was bland and unremarkable . the veggie lo mein ? no flavor , greasy and again - stale . my husband got the general tso 's chicken and said it was the worst he 'd had . i wanted so badly to like this place because i 'm always looking for decent chinese in the area but sadly , we will not return .
0	this place is completely overpriced and the staff was inattentive . miguel seemed annoyed we didn 't want to order right away , but chose to enjoy an appetizer first . the sushi is about the same as the local convenience store . i would rate it zero stars .
0	after 3 failed attempts i am giving up they never come on time when you when you pick it up the order is wrong everything is left off when you finally get your pizza over an hour and a half later it is cold as smashed even though you gave a driver a $ 5 tip i 've had enough . i then call the manager and they just keep hanging up on me 11 times they do not care. do not order from them do not tip them that you horrible horrible work . fire these rude ungrateful employees please .
0	three times i 've given this place by chance and the outcome is the exact same just complete shit ! ! !
0	after asking to order 2 kids meals with 2 kids with me - they outright refused ! said i could only order 1 kids meal & could not take the extra food home with me . no food could be ordered to go if i wanted to order extra to take home with me . rude servers & even rudder management . would not ever recommend this restaurant to even my worst enemy ! !
0	they over charged us and then blamed it on us ! the food is only ok , certainly not worth the the hype ! do not eat here !
0	went with my daughter . stood waiting for a table for ten minutes with nobody coming up and the place was empty . there was a waitress with a crying baby in the kitchen who was ignoring us . i ask twice at takeout window for help but was ignored . skip this place !
0	we went into the restaurant and asked for a table for two . the lady said " okay , one moment . " she then turned to her friend that came after us . she turned to them started talking and catching up with them and totally ignored us . i mean obviously ignored us . i assume she doesn 't care for gay people or perhaps we were not the right race . however , we left , dusted our shoes off and will not return .
0	female server act like deaf . i have to stand up and grab her from the table next to me . sat there for an hour only appetizer came . can 't believe they actually have three star . hope you close down asap . such a wasting of time .
0	everything taste horrible and then what it does to you after wards is even worse
0	ordered the spicy korean with chicken and i received 4 small pieces of chicken that was microwaved and a sauce that tasted like blended diarrhea . worst part was no sriracha to drown this crap in . also the price was outrageous . i would highly recommend panda express if you want to eat crap but save a little money .
0	not to mention , incredibly expensive for small portion sizes ! that said , i 'm glad the portions were small because it was less for me to throw out in the garbage . the overall flavor is just , sour and tangy . almost as if it 's completely spoiled . hot garlic wings : 4 / 10 vegetables with tofu : 3 / 10 cantonese chow mein : 0 / 10 garlic beef : 1 / 10 vegetable fried rice : 6 / 10 overall : 2 / 10 = 1 star rating

0	i can 't believe this place is i business . everything comes out of bags . frozen pre made crap . i took one bite and almost threw up . my food tastes like chemicals . spent $ 22 took one bite and left . please don 't eat here . your encouraging these clowns to continue there culinary abortion . barf .
0	i can 't believe they got these ratings from other ppl .
0	extremely rude server- she shouldn 't be working there . a couple actually left before even ordering- we should have followed them . the pho was good don 't get me wrong- but in the service industry- service is everything ! ! don 't waste your time or money at a place that acts like they don 't even want you there .
0	the soup tasted like roast beef soup . it was brouwn and the vegetables were old and wilted . they did not even serve the soup with a soup spoon . don 't ever order the pho .
0	extremely small portion for $ 8 and was completely bland . i asked to return it politely and was treated very rudely .
0	absolutely the worst place i 've eaten in. i ordered tempura udon and the soup had like dried bamboo sprouts ? it smelled like shit and the whole udon bowl tasted so disgusting. too much carrot and overall , not worth the price you pay. my sister ordered spicy ramen i tried to taste the soup and it was way too salty. not going back to this place ever. i ended up eating the mochis that i bought from the japanese market in the same shopping mall for dinner. we left over half because of the weird smell in the food .
0	all chicken appetizers tastes identical . they tried to claim they no longer accept the yelp 10 % off .
0	absolutely the worst service ever ... came in for a very expensive dinner with 4 people waited , waited , waited ... and finally got water , a special occasion my parents came 10 years ago for an anniversary and got nothing the same ... the manager steven gave no care , and the server ( daniel ) gave little effort ... spent hundreds and would have rather went to in and out
0	i was left standing for 30min when the people after us were seated just cause they were rude and loud . unbelievable ! after we finally seated i was served the wrong dessert and not even given any water .... when i finished my dessert in the quickest manner just to leave the horrible atmosphere , the waitress didn 't even hand me my change and left it on the counter when i was less than a meter away . don 't know why i even bothered try this place ....
0	my food came out a full half hour before the other three folks at the table. so my meal was room temperature by the time my wife got hers . the other two meals crawled out an age later . so stupid ! tasted pleasant but so what ! ! ! ? ? ? if i want to eat alone or in front of everyone i will stay home . yack !
0	ordered sesame chicken and was told i would receive it in 25 minutes . i called 4 times after it passed 40 minutes ( the lady just kept hanging up after quickly saying they were busy ) , and it finally arrived 1.5hrs later . he wouldn 't give me a discount and the food was luke warm . not even good quality food . i didn 't even get a fortune in my cookie !
0	servers did not smile and just did not look like that wanted to be there . i dined in with my family . my daughter accidentally knocked over my glass and not one server offered to assist me clean up the mess ! they did not even offer napkins i literally had to get them myself . i could not believe it . the entire dinner my son did not even get a refill . the sushi was decent .. i would recommend trying another sushi spot . there are literally thousands in las vegas . after this experience i will defiantly be back . this place sucks ! !
0	the staff was rude and hung up on me while i was ordering . our food never arrived after waiting 2 hours . upon canceling the lady told us we were no longer allowed to eat there . never eating there again !
0	waited 20 min to be acknowledged . this was after moving into the restaurant from the bar where we sat for 15 min . was finally greeted at the sushi bar only to have our server give us used sushi menu and then dissapeared for another 5 min . the place was not busy . at all . we kindly left . went to hannys .
0	they also tried to charge me an additional 8 $ as i couldn 't finish what i ordered due to how horrible it was . will not be returning
0	the salmon appears to have gone through a microwave ( see my photo ) , tuna is flaking and grey . so bad we sent it back .
0	it was gross ! ! ! i don 't know why they use so much rice or why the fish wasn 't cold . you couldn 't pay me to go back to this place !
0	the only reason i gave them 1 star is that you can 't give them 0 stars . unbelievably poor service . the only thing they are good at is apologizing . but with as much practice as they must get , they should be good at it . never again .
0	the menu does not reflect what you are actually getting . ordered a fattoush salad with a beef skewer which the menu shows as two ( 2 ) skewers and got the salad ( rather small portion ) and one ( 1 ) skewer . all this for about $ 20 for a take out lunch . stay away and avoid a bad experience . if it helps , me va me a better choice ( fair distance away ) or any other nearby place at the village . understand new location but not worth it .
0	absolutely vile disgusting , not dog worthy crap. id rather eat my own puke re-regurgitated ( and yes thats what i meant lol ) nothing could have saved that food. everything that could be wrong with it was. first the basics , the portion was over priced and small the container was something that should be used to bring home , not to eat out of lastly , the place didnt look all that clean , but wrote that off as it just being the strip and vegas. now the bulk .... the smell was off it looked gross the chicken was chewy and crunchy ? and just the most vile thing in the world- the sauce was just i-c-k i cant even think about it anymore
0	just to add a little more " omph flavour " add some long strand of black hair from the staff ? ... your mouth must be watering now ? ... soggy freezing chips , slightly colder than the refrigerated coleslaw ... ( not really sure how that happened ) a lot of customers orders where returned when i was there .. only to be momentarily taken away behind the kitchen and simply placed back on the warm line , very hygienic ? will never be returning to this business , won 't be long till food safety is forcing there way in ... that 's if the door would actually open ( all people will know what i mean if you have been )
0	some of the worst chinese food i have ever tasted . the boneless " spare ribs " were dry and has very little sauce on them . the fried rice was crunchy . the crab rangoon was greasy and had very little cream cheese in it . the egg rolls tasted like frozen store bought ones that had freezer burn . never again . plus , they were more expensive than some of the better chinese food in the area .
0	it was about 85 degrees in the restaurant . the owner ( i am guessing ) was so rude to us that it made the food ( which wasn 't bad , but scanty portions ) literally turn in our stomachs . i honestly doubt they will stay in business with how rude they treat patrons and how cheap they are with the air conditioning . a very bad experience , overall .
0	i will not come back here .. service is the reason i will not come back ! ! !
0	the rice was oddly wet and smooshed down ( i could barely detect that it was rice ) , the seaweed was mushy , wet and stringy , and my tempura shrimp roll was the size of a woman 's fist . the whole experience ( if one could call it that ) was deplorable ... the woman did give me my money back after i took the slop up to the counter , but oh , my god , i can 't get that foul taste out of my mouth .... what was i thinking ?
0	will not go back . hard to even comment any further .
0	then how do they let their managers dress like that it looks like she just got out of bed . very rude and disrespectful she is the worse .
0	the old lady is really rude and disrespectful . i would never recommend this asian market and i will not go back . stay away !
0	how hard is it to price an item ? i went to check out a bag of dumplings and the cashier wasn 't able to ring it up since this " new " item wasn 't in their system yet . they couldn 't even accommodate their customers and make up a price to sell as miscellaneous ? i even asked the manager and she just refused to sell it to me . really ? i 'm just trying to buy a bag of dumplings ! ! ! if you aren 't ready to sell an item , then there 's no reason to put it out on the floor yet !
0	it 's not your typical attitude kind of place so it was refreshing to see that from the worker standpoint . it is like walking into a restaurant run by social political party and you have no idea who the manager is as it is run by everyone and the manager was nowhere to be found when we asked for one . very interesting experience . next time you go there ask for a manager to see if they exist .
0	absolutely worthless. the food is expansive and too salty , no test at all .
0	a shame as when it first opened it was quite good but the last couple of years it 's just terrible . amazed i tis still open .
0	waited over 45 minutes for an online order that we ordered ahead of time . when we complained they just shrugged and said sorry . they screwed up our order and multiple peoples orders as we were waiting . will not return .
0	this used to be my go to place for sushi and rolls but this time the eel roll and pork katsu that my partner and i ordered was just a sheer disappointment . they tasted like frozen food straight from the fridge at loblaw . the service was also poor . there are plenty of other japanese places along bloor street and i would advise anyone who are planning to visit this place to just pass through and walk a bit more to find a better place .
0	food was bland the service was slow the fried milk burned out mouths to a crisp and even the fountain drinks were sub par . never again .
0	good looking waitress but whats the use f the food takes ages to come . taste is average and not worth the cost . ie no value for money . not gonna visit this one again . i can cook my own noodles at home for 1 / 10th the price and 200 % better taste .
0	i called and the person who answered the phone did noy speak english . they have a live chat , but i wanted to speak to someone in person . they provided me with a 1-877 number which was not in service . i just wanted to ask a couple of questions and was not comfortable giving my visa . what happened to live customer service ?
0	i don 't think i have ever had a manger yell at me in any establishment until meeting elliot ! i explained to him his cashier was nice nasty and rather then taking the feedback and being thankful someone pointed out he said that 's just how she is . then he was pissed i asked for an off menu item and after i told him i did not need any further explanation he continued to make a scene in front of his other guest . it was humiliating and horrible.this is what the service industry has come too ?
0	i recently spent $ 170 dollars on 12 items and had them delivered . they messed up my order , as usual , and the had the audacity to blame me for their poor service . my ten dollar delivery fee was supposed to be waved and it wasn 't . when asked to have it waved i told that they wouldn 't because i didn 't put a code in . first off i ordered the five items to keep it free and further spent over 150 dollars which also makes your charge free . this place is terrible . i will never spend my money at another safeway . ever .
0	i would never recommend this to anyone . they use long wongs wing sauce it 's better to go there .
0	if i could give zero stars i would . i tried to place a delivery order for my mom so she could have dinner as i do not live in the same state . they were over 2 hours late , with no phone call to let me know they were running late . the girl answering the phone had no clue whats going on , the lack of leadership their is mind-blowing , assuming the owner has no control or involvement of his business . such a shame . this place will be out of business within a year .
0	it was essentially a pile of sticky fried bread with 4 broccoli florets . more like nasty monkey bread than any kind of asian cuisine . couldn 't eat it .
0	the food was very undercooked and cold . the staff seemed sweet but they weren 't very customer service oriented . i will never eat here again .
0	first of all , the food was absolutely disgusting . not only was it something that was out of the ordinary for us ( such as lobster cut in half , still alive and moving ) , but the food lacked freshness , and it was all so bland . second , it expensive for something we were completely unsatisfied with , and a 10 % gratuity charge is automatically added onto the bill . needless to say , we went to timmies afterwards to grab a bagel cause we left that place still feeling hungry !
0	took over 10 minutes to get our bar drinks and there was only 4 tables inside . then when they came they were not the right drinks ! waitress took forever to refill our water . we got the create your own meal and had to find someone who worked there to fill up empty items on the buffet ! i had to get up and get our own chopsticks , soy sauce and salt because our server was nowhere to be found .
0	took 1 1 / 2 hours for the food and called the place to complain offered a 10 % discount . the food was old and cold the driver and manger very rude ! never again ! ! ! !
0	i have never been treated so rudely . food was cold . managers girlfriend was even rude . floor was sticky and food sub par .
0	no one was in there yet took 15 mins for someone to take my order . didn 't even get water brought to me until i asked . counter tops hadn 't been cleaned at bar even dishes were still on them . the dishes sat there from the people before for over two hours ( no joke ) . never got asked how my food was and no one ever offered a refill for my water . i would have ordered a beer but never got approached once food was served . had to request ticket . over price pho which isn 't authentic . such a waste of time and money
0	i havent been there for a few years .. but definately wont be back ! ! ! ! all tasted the same ... very few veg ... very fine if there was any in there at all . i cant remember the dish but called for noodles ....... spaghetti in a chinese dish ... no , no ! ! ! ! just cant believe it has went downhill so bad ! ! ! ! !
0	had to wait almost 2 hours to get served . they forgot my water twice . and they didn 't bring out the food at the same time as the others at my table so they were done their meals before i even got mine . so i ended up getting it to go so i didn 't have to make everyone wait . the place is extremely dirty and understaffed . i 'd rate it -5 stars is that was an option .
0	the worst chiness food i have ever tasted ! ! i wouldnt eat this even if i starved for a week i hate to be negative but there food just puts me in a foul mood ! ! god damn nasty ! ! i am sorry but its just bad ! !
0	we should have walked out after we saw the condition and cleanliness of this establishment . absolutly my fault for staying . the food is no good and its expensive . never again .
0	my brother and i yelped the place and said it was open till 11pm . we arrive at 10 : 15 ( note : open light was on ! ! ) and the waitress / hostess says they 're closed already and that last call was at 10 : 30 ! we told her that it was only 10 : 15 and she responds saying , " yeah but we 're already closed ! " so we left ! ! you can already tell that they have bad service and they need to learn how to tell time . it never even was stated anywhere that last call was at 10 : 30 !
0	i had an udon noodle bowl with green curry . very , very mediocre food . i don 't understand how that can be called curry . their noodles were extremely watery . i would not recommend their food if you 're looking for taste .
0	i stopped in here for a snack one day and ordered some dumplings . though i sat down in the restaurant , they were served in a dismissing take-away bag . the dumplings were coated heavily in grease and the plastic container was filled with grease . consider this restaurant 's food for a guest that you want to leave .
0	don 't need to try their food to know i 'm never giving them my service again !
0	inspectors found old food , including brown , slimy parsley and greens , spoiled cabbage and lichee with broken skins and slimy insides . there were also three dead shrimp and two dead crabs in the live seafood tanks , flies in the kitchen , and lots of food had to be thrown out due to unsafe temperatures , including pork neck bones and two ducks sitting in stagnant water . they were closed for 8 days . the owner who also owns chang 's hong kong cuisine on decatur near tropicana was on dirty dining july of 2015 . food express have re-opened with an a grade .
0	very rude manager . watched them turn away 6 customers at 11 : 50pm .
0	showed up at 10 : 40pm and it was closed . very disappointed !
0	the broth is salty and the noodles are cheap egg noodles . the dumplings appear to from a frozen pre-packaged bag . the service was friendly and timely . but nothing can makeup for the straight up bad food . i honestly think i could replicate their soup with some miso bean paste and egg noodles . i would not recommend this restaurant to friends and i would be surprised if it 's still open at this time next year .
0	i don 't think they cook their food on the premises since i overheard one employee talking about getting more cooked food at the warehouse . might explain why their food was half cooked . better to order out of the convention center .
0	never go to this restaurant again . i 've posted their racist actions on social media . we will see .
0	i 'm a regular diner here having lived in vegas for over 2yrs . usually i get the bun bo hue ( one of the best place in town for it ) or the generous portions of tai nam . no matter how good the food taste , i am never going back . definitely will call and notify the city 's health department tomorrow .
0	a cockroach was climbing on the desk. only one waitress. worst service ever. dishes took one hour to serve
0	as per the instructions online , patrons are required to provide advance notice of preferred set menu with kamayan to prepare the food . i 've selected premium - set b for $ 39.95 / person . casa manila failed to deliver what had been promised in the menu . the milkfish was replaced with battered pieces of fish and tiny pieces of squid , not as per advertised in the photo . quality and volume as presented on website is not representative of you will really get . refer to attached photo .
0	i had ordered a cubed beef dish , a chef specialty according to the menu . it turns out it 's a rump steak of grade of f ( ail ) cut . the beef was not cut in cubes they were more like sloppy strips . the dish was over salted and tough to chew . very disappointing . as for the environment , this restaurant is basement level . many passerby smoke in the area and while sitting in the restaurant the front door is ajar . not a good idea because patrons get big whiffs of second hand cigarette smoke that just hangs in the air . unpleasant .
0	overpriced and undercut sushi / sashimi . this restaurant is a complete joke . doesn 't matter how much food you ordered , you just can 't get full . dude ... sushi is either fresh or not fresh . your sushi ain 't made of gold . so give up this almighty attitude that you are located in bellagio and cut the damn sushi / sashimi the size for an adult and not some 3 year old kid . nothing cute about the size of your sushi / sashimi . this restaurant tried too hard to be high end which will lead it to total failure .
0	but this place cloned badly ! ! soup is way too salty . i ordered ramen , but their ramen wasn 't ramen . beef tendon and octopus balls were both flavorless . the casserole rice wasn 't well cooked . the worst is ............. there were a lot of flies ; they buzzed around and tap danced on our table . the waitress came over and said , " they come coz our food smell good ! " she rolled up a piece of paper and hit a fly on our table ! ! lost my appetite right when the fly was certified !
0	on my last visit , i ordered my usual pork fried rice to go , but ended up throwing half of it out . it was mushy , flavourless , and overall unpleasant . a shadow of its former self , i won 't be returning .
0	but 10 mins into our dinner we saw two roaches crawling on top of the coolers where the kept all there raw sashimi . after that we were pretty grossed out so decided to ask if we could pay half and just leave . might be good but they def have a roach problem .
0	perhaps i would accept their food given their great location near campus , but their service is atrocious , youre more likely to get into a fistfight with one of the staff than leave with a pleasant experience .
0	i won 't be back . i don 't think i can visit another ayce with worse service . they always serve you only half of what you order , pretend to not see you when you 're trying to get their attention and the place is just not clean ! 2 hours of waiting before any food arrives . yes , the food quality is slightly better than other ayce sushi restaurants . but i live in north york and happy to have sushi legend near me when i want my ayce sushi fix . there 's always something dirty in the utensils they serve in . my submitted photo already made the lipstick stain less obvious ... no thank you !
0	i 'm not sure he was talking about the same restaurant . i walked in and there was just a guy asleep at the counter . i stood there , looked around , no menu , no food cooking , no drinks in the cooler , and didn 't seem very clean . guy still asleep .... walked back out .
0	the egg rolls are disgusting , the one peice of crab rangoon i received was burnt ! my cashew chicken with fried rice was so disappointing , as the fried rice was burnt with little brown eggs and smelled horrible ( could 've been the over usage of bean sprouts in the fried rice ) . the sweet & sour chicken could have been so great - but the breading was soggy and the chicken was so dry & chewy ... not to mention they forgot the drinks i paid for ...
0	fail and fail over priced , over salted and selection was 1 / 4 of what you can find at mandarin . salmon was frozen. fail not going back for 20 dollars a pop this place should be called woo fear factor
0	service is not so fast . takes them quite a while to prepare an order when i was the only one there . i never buy the " pre-packaged " meals , i always order fresh . however when i was eating it , it really wasn 't fresh . i was so bad , i had to ask for my money back , how unpleased i was . the place is really small , you can hardly move around properly . really not a good place for sushi .
0	however , in truncating the menu and making it quick and airport-friendly , they did away with everything good about their other restaurants . just a bad bad move . i have to agree with mysterious q , i 'd hit up a panda express first ... and i 've driven half-an-hour ( and would again ) for flo 's other restaurants .
0	i have been to lots and lots of ayce places , i am telling you this is the worst place i have ever been to . first of all , the place smells like bleach . chairs are dirty , table is sticky ! ! none of the sashimi and sushi are fresh . tempura is gross . miso soup has weird taste . service is horrible , the servers are so rude ! ! i kindly tell you my friends , dont waste your time and money in such disgusting restaurant . please take my advice .
0	waited 35 minutes without any sort of acknowledgement . finally had to ask one of the servers and was told it was going to be another 15-20 minutes with a slight smirk . we are " backed up " he said . more then enough tables to seat the additional 4 parties behind us just not smart enough with wait management for a restaurant . no apologies , none needed , because i don 't think they really cared . should have walked out within 15 minutes .
0	tasted awful , oily , and made me feel sick soon after eating it . nooooo thank you , never again .
0	i ordered a delivery 2 and half hours ago and was supposed to get it after 45 . when i asked for a refund or discount on my food they refused. the employees i talked to barely spoke english and just hung up on me . dont go here
0	i can 't say how the other dishes were but their noodle salad ( # 42 bun with shrimp and egg roll ) shrimp not really grilled ( bland ) . no mint in the salad but parsley ! ! used what appeared to be iceberg . no vietnamese pickled veggies . just really bland and not good . service was great .
0	in general the food quality is very bad . it is just like a teenager trying to learn how to cook after watching a cooking show . must never ever order their tomyum soup . it 's extremely bad . the shrimps seemed burned out and quantity way below the mark i feel i lost my money by visiting this kind of a " c " class restaurant . the hygiene standard is not satisfactory at all . never ever visit here if you wanna eat chinese .
0	if they want to do a mini teppan-yaki then make sure your system runs smoothly . it was a chaos ! your customer should not wait for the food for the average of 20 minutes in a food court . and your food is bland or too spicy .
0	add + 20 minutes to you wait time for pick up orders when the restaurant is not busy. poor customer service .
0	each order put in takes 20 min . food was decent but takes way too long !
0	i told the waitress that i had already placed our order and was trying to get her attention for the past 5 mins . she did not look happy . got the take out meal - it was 90 % rice and a surprise gum spit into my meal . the fact she told the time to spit gum into my food cause i added an order 3 mins late but the food had to be thrown out .
0	i would like to retract that . after finding out that social house messed up a reservation that i made for my bffl 's birthday dinner , thankfully a couple of days before the actual dinner , i doubt i would ever see the inside of social house again . we 're going to nobu instead .
0	no thank you republic ramen , no thank you and never again .
0	i understand that las vegas isn 't exactly a foodie destination ( outside of several restaurants on and around the strip ) . thai style noodle house is no exception . my party had the following : mongolian beef , beef and broccoli , spicy string beans and pork , crispy noodles with seafood gravy . sweet , sweet , sweet , with a bit of msg . white seats with faux ( ? ) leather all look dirty and our table top was sticky . one star for the price as this is considered to be cheap asian food . my advice : head over to nattaya 's secret kitchen across the street . you 'll pay more but you 'll get much better food .
0	plates are lacking vegetables and meats , loaded with rice and noodles . brought this to the attention of the staff , cook was rude and only willing to add the vegetables , if i paid more ! when you need a quick fix it will do but it will not be what you see on the menu .
0	never had i ever experienced eating a worse pho in my life . the soup base was not flavourful nor had a taste that resembles pho . and the meat , i think i counted maybe 6 pieces of meat in my bowl . if they can 't master pho or even have something that resembles it , which is a vietnamese staple , they should pack up shop , for they will ruin someone 's first experience of falling in love with pho . i left this place seething mad inside , i felt cheated after eating here , that 's how bad it was .
0	good food ; horrible , horrible service . a lot of green kids in their first jobs operating with no direction . no communication between those working the counter and the cooks behind them . they kept running out of food and the poor girl doing the initial serving was sweet but desperately needs help . the line moved at a snail 's pace . no one was cleaning the place . a lot of frustrated first timers who won 't return . where was management today or is management part of the problem . this place won 't last unless it has an immediate turn around . shame-- good food .
0	walls and even their chairs are rotted . we ordered a spicy shrimp , but the meat was not fresh at all . i just regret bringing my family here and for sure we won 't visit again .
0	twice they have told us to wait over an hour for a scheduled pickup order that was ordered hours before . a dozen other people waiting in line with the same complaint . this longstanding restaurant needs to learn how to handle their supply and demand catastrophe .
0	if i had to rate the broccoli chicken , it would be a 5 . the fried rice is a 1 star , which is weird because fried rice is hard to screw up . it will be hard not to eat here again because it is good and the location is great , but they 're obviously not wearing hats or hair nets in the kitchen . it makes me wonder what else is going on in the kitchen .
0	i only had two appetizers , and they both were bad and expensive . the " new style sashimi " was $ 14 for 5 thin slices of cooked fish . no where on the menu does it say it 's cooked , and nothing in the history of the universe suggests sashimi is cooked . to boot , the staff tried to charge me $ 28 for this ungodly abomination . that was quickly taken care of , but nothing else was done in a timely manner . i wouldn 't even recommend this place for drinks as service was slow and inattentive at the bar .
0	advertised hours on the door show monday through friday 7 : 30-4 : 00 p.m. i arrived at 2 : 30 to a closed location .
0	got there at 3am and they were closing . i said we have 12 people with us and they just ignored me and closed the door in my face
0	advertised prices are not the same as the options you have + sushi quality was not even good no complains about the services .
0	the food and setting itself is incredibly mediocre . wouldn 't recommend this restaurant to any one i know .
0	the managers were rude and complaining about their previous customers in the dining room , focused too much on ranting to each other to answer a paying customers question .... disappointed ... rude staff ... bunk deal ....
0	i wish i could put 0 stars . service is so bad , the servers look like they are miserable with their lives . i also ordered shrimp tempura and fried calamari for appetizers and it tastes like the one you get from costco boxes . food got to me so cold ..
0	i always go to their original location in markham , trying their new location was a horrible experience ! wanted to order curry but it 's sold out . wanted to order just a simple drink diet coke but they don 't have it . food tastes different than the original location , the noodle is totally different . after eating 80 % of the food , found a little short hair in the potato side of the bento ! unacceptable ! will never come back again !
0	do not go . expensive and not tasty . not to mention bad service and 2hour wait time .
0	we waited till 11 : 20 and they were still closed . very unprofessional . we had to run through the drive-thru to make it back to work on time .
0	then the manager offer to mail me a coupon for a meal on them . i supplied my mailing address , and heard nothing more from the manager , and no coupon in the mail . been almost a month ... can you give a negative star ?
0	tasteless , bad presentation , and stingy service .. i used to come here twice a year maybe , but will definitely not be coming back . so disappointing !
0	i 'm not the one to leave a bad review but recently we returned and it 's as if the place took a complete turn around ! upon entry the service was terrible , you could only imagine how the rest of it went . after 30mins and asking 5 times we finally received our waters ( straight from the sink ) . most of what we ordered seemed like its been reheated . wouldn 't recommend coming here late night . staff doesn 't give 100 % service
0	when i opened my steamy lunch combo , it was super greasy with a hair to boot . ( which i discovered only after my first two nibbles ) nice. i have never ordered from them since. yikes .
0	now it is far behind panda . i tried the general chicken for lunch and ate only the noodles . the chicken was old and very hard crusted . i broke crusted chicken open to get to the meat which was hard and dark brown . sorry ho ho ho , but never again. oh , the first clue was nobody there at 12 : 30pm .
0	i was there to have my food first . benihana has been steadily spiraling down , that i know . yet as long as they still charge people a hefty price for the benihana experience , the headquarter has a responsibility to make sure each franchise maintain a certain standard. benihana cleveland ( actually beachwood , oh ) is clearly a failure / shame / disgrace to the benihana brand .
0	a late night drunken regretful eating choice perhaps but definitely not for the sober or for the mindful ... worth a skip . .i 'm exaggerating ...
0	" we couldn 't wait to leave , and both agreed we 'd never go back .
0	my other friend ordered a bento box that came with a salad and never got her salad , but when she asked for it , the waitress refused to give her the salad ? ! ! anyways , nice decor but horrible service and food was meh ... never going back !
0	during the meal i started feeling dizzy and lightheaded but shrugged it off . then on the ride home got super sick and threw up everything and spent the rest of the night nauseous and sweating .
0	we waited twenty minutes for the waiter to come to our table . then it took an hour and twenty more minutes to get the food . by the time the sushi arrived , we were starving . the presentation was excellent , and i was anticipating some excellent sushi goodness . wrong . i looked at my friend and said , " this tastes like it came out of the la river . " she agreed . we paid the bill and left most of the food still on the plates . it was completely unpalatable . what a disappointment .
0	the bartender abruptly said there 's a place with tv next door ! who the hell tells customers to visit some other place when you already have customers at the restaurant ? horrible customer service . we ordered the pork skewers and fried rice . both were disgusting . avoid this place ! go to khao san road instead .
0	i believe the roll i ordered was called the double down . sounded good on the menu but when it got served it looked like some fear factor challenge . tasted like it too . ordered a spicy tuna hand roll and it was better than the roll but not much . edamame and the miso soup were the best things i ordered and def was not worth the price . the music they played was the worst playlist of songs i ever heard and i noticed it even more bc the food was so horrible and it was kind of an appropriate soundtrack to the meal
0	i have pretty low expectations and they failed to meet them . and it 's no longer my friend 's favorite place to visit when she goes to vegas . the food was ok ... three stars . there was no one else in the place . the attitude from the younger sushi chef was unbelievable ... we should have walked out . what an a-hole . the waitresses stood about 2 feet away from us the entire time . awkward . my friend who loved going here and has brought several people , said she 's never going back . don 't waste your time or money .
0	i found it on-line and it looks like a really nice place to eat . i called and made a reservation for 3 . my friends and i met there and were greeted and seated right away ( place was empty not a good sign ) . we ordered our food and couldn 't stop talking about it ... but not in a good way . the chef put foam on every course ... even the desert . i think foam has it 's place , but not on every dish .
0	the decor is very odd and messy , the tables were greasy with dried rice on the chairs and dried sauce stains on the chair as well . the people that were working there was very rude . so i decided to get the student deal , since it seems like a good deal . in the student deal you get a quarter piece chicken , rice and potatoes . the chicken was dry , the rice is bland and potatoes were decent . the price for this dish was $ 4.99 . pretty much you get what you paid for . not worth it . better try somewhere else !
0	it was live snail ! it just show that this place doesn 't properly wash their vegetables .
0	she only eats specific foods when dining out . my friends was told that her sister was not allowed to eat the food that she brought , as it was considered to be " outside food . " she sarcastically asked if she should feed her sister outside ... where the staff replied yes . humiliated , my friend took her sister out of the restaurant , and fed her pretty much on the street . i am absolutely disgusted by the actions of this establishment , will never dine here and will recommend everyone i know to boycott this restaurant .
0	i enjoyed the food , but the service was very unsatisfactory .
0	this place is so gross . the first plate i grabbed had a live bug on it . i don 't eat sushi so i couldn 't say if it was good or not , but it looked awful . i really enjoy teriyaki but the beef was cooked in mushrooms , so that was out . i tried to get some fried rice , but again it was swimming in mushrooms . i have never seen fried rice with shrooms it it , who does that ? potstickers and ice cream may be the only safe bets in this place , if you can disregard the bugs .
0	it was ok tasting , very oily , but the yakisoba cost 10.95 and it was a child size portion , pitiful , and they charged extra to put mini pieces of broccoli , and i mean mini . the yakisoba does not come with rice , they charge you for a side order , anyway i dooooooo not recommend this place also i think i had about 7 small pieces of steak in my yakisoba . don 't spend your money . never again .
0	i think it got its name right . crazy enough that there 's barely anything to eat . everything is dry and some trays only have a couple piece in the tray , which looks really sad . even if i want to try the dishes they have , there 's nothing in there but crumbs . they didn 't bother replenishing the trays and left it there . in my opinion , buffet @ asia is better . this is the same experience i had 3 years ago , no change . i won 't be returning .
0	food was good but the fry rice was a little under cooked . i wont be coming back because that service was extremely horrible . i didnt even received my birthday picture nor did they sing to me : - ( i also want to add how our waitress was so concerned about getting a tip from the table in front of us that she would ignore us . i asked for water then i heard someone say coke so i asked her do you have coke products and she said no only pepsi so i said okay am fine with water . of course she brings me a pepsi . i believe they should have some younger people working there that also understand english .
0	a restaurant so repulsive even after a six hour drive i turned every single thing down . simply atrocious in every single facet that matters , not a single redeeming quality to be found except the quiet location and decor . soup is not a quartered squash in water with a hunk of watered down vegetables and meat . avoid at all costs , hunger is a better alternative .
0	i only went myself because of the 45 minute wait fiasco last time . well , nothing has changed . it took 40 minutes to get 2 hot dogs . the wait when they are busy is ridiculous . the food is fine but i cannot bring myself to come back . my biggest issue is that when i wrote my first review , i was offered free hot dogs for me , my wife , and son to give it another try and that never happened . slow and doesn 't keep to their word . avoid ! ! !
0	once among the best , i am giving up .
0	my husband 's pasta bowl is less than fresh ; everything ( incl chicken wings ) is warm-ish at best . i called twice , spoke to 2 different guys trying to track my order , who both told me its out for delivery now . the driver had a total of 2 orders ; he drove to the farther destination first ( ? ? ! ? ) and neither ticket had the apartment number printed on it . this is not the first time we 've said we 'll never do this again . but seriously , we won 't .
0	service was fast ! like " you-just-ordered-10-mins-ago " fast but sh * t ... food was served cold ! ! ! ! and i meant , not even warm or room temperature at least ? the two quickest food you think they can prepare in a hurry , egg drop soup and chow mein , was probably a left over from the night before and didn 't even bother to heat it up for us ! yuck ! ! ! ! do yourself a favor ! ! ! go somewhere else or just buy yourself a bowl of noodles from 7-11 . don 't even think about going here ! ! love live the " panda . " lol
0	the past few times i have gone it takes forever to get a seat . then it takes a bit to get your drink and its a bother to ask for a refill . when you want your check - that takes forever too . you would think they would be on top of that and try to get people in and out faster . the sushi is just okay and i now would rather spend a little more for great customer service and better quality sushi . if you do decide to go , take a peek at the floor surrounding the sushi making station . disgusting ! it looks like what you would find underneath a refrigerator .
0	today we went in and waited ..... over 15 minutes after we were seated and no one came by to get out drink order . two waitresses were just sitting in the back chatting . so we left . before that it took them over an hour to cook a piece of chicken for one of the orders in our group . by the time we had gotten everyone else 's food and had eaten , the chicken was still not done . should have seen the signs then . please do yourself a favor and avoid this place and they could do everyone else a favor and close down . customer service sucks there .
0	after a few years of not eating here cuz it was terrible , i thought i 'd give it another try. here 's my thoughts .. still the worst food ever .. pad thai fishy tasting. ruined the taste of thai tea , very expensive for the horrible food. will never eat here again .
0	i 'm glad i didn 't use a credit card .
0	unfortunately i am yet to find a place that has good orange chicken - not a hint of orange in it ! anyway , i wasn 't impressed , the fried rice was just blah .
0	bad idea . just cause we 're doing ayce they short stroked me with this sad piece of meat . pass this place and stick with sakana and hikari .
0	food was salty and nana was not good . i will stick with jaipur it 's worth the extra drive for certain . i can only comment on buffet .
0	the service was horrible . no greeting , hello , nothing . the waitress was frowning all the time . i thought she was having a bad day and then i see her giggling away with other staff . we walked away without eating . i am not going to patronize a place which does not provide even basic customer service .
0	after a long day of driving we yelp this place with excitement to find it was closed when it clearly states opened til 12midnight
0	i ordered a plate with half chow mein half fried rice & double kung pau & i 'm pretty sure i got more vegetables then chicken in my kung pau & i only got rice , no chow mein . i 'll just stick to the panda on 51 ave .
0	hours are listed as 11 am to 10 pm . i arrived at 10 : 40 am , still closed , no problem . it 's now 11 : 25 . still closed . no signage indicating why it 's closed . website not updated . no answer on the phone . so , why did i wait 45 minutes when i could have driven to jinya ? regrets , but we all make mistakes in life . i will forever rue this day .
0	the price was a whopping 38 instead of the advertised 30 . the decor is clean but the place is under staffed . the main highlight , snow crab was half frozen .
0	i received raw , uncooked fries and boiling hot soda . no ketchup , was charged a deliver fee and the deliver man ask for a tip . he ask ! ! ! i would never again order from this place .
0	i should 've followed my first thought and went somewhere else . while i will say that i love their happy hour drink specials , the food leaves much to be desired . i ordered the salmon rolls , which was disappointing . the roll was 92 percent rice , 5 percent veggie and 3 percent salmon . the only upside was the waiter at the bar provided good service . i will never return again . the elephant bar is a waste of money and space .
0	food was good but not worth the hassle to get it .
0	not worth the money you pay . bathrooms are so disgusting i was scared to us it . definitely won 't be back here ever
0	no surprise ! same cheap ownership , same under-staffed . watching the poor servers running like crazy chicks is not helping the appetite . i guess the clientele here only concerns more on cheap food rather than anything else . that 's why this place still exists . so long , congee w !
0	it is terrible since they didn 't meet my expectation and the price is outrageous . the most difficult part of the pho is the broth ( req 16 hours of preparation ) and it tasted like water . i had to add all kind of condiments to rescue it but can 't even eat it . the restaurant is very slow now and it confirmed what i meant with asian restaurant . if your fellow asians don 't patronize the place , it is because your food did not meet our expectation . try across the street to the rice plate kim thanh for their rice dish . it is night and day .
0	there is an asian guy who works here taking people 's orders . as i waited to order i was trying to make changes he snatched the menu out of my hand and walked away , fast . i was in shocked and i told him " look you can 't be doing that . " he ended talking back to me telling me " i was taking my time with the menu . " this is outrages how i wasn 't even giving up the time to order my meal . i will not come back to this disturbing and rude business that serves dirty fish as sushi and don 't wash the lettuce in the salad . bye bye .
0	all they did was put an area in which they can serve you the same food that they 've always had . yeah , it 's open 24 / 7 , but if you go late at night there is little to nothing that is stocked either . i am a night owl because of my job , so the only time i would visit would be around 10pm-3am during my work week , and nothing would never see any of the food i bought in stock , the ones that i would see would either expire on that day or the day after .
0	" we obviously didn 't . they 're ridiculous , nobody should treat a customer like that .
0	walked in with out of town friend waitress acknowledged us , but that was about it . the busier prep 'd four table tops and we were never seated . what a shame with the amount of competition in the area they should have been on their game . we walked out , and went directly across the street to wabi sushi
0	i turn around and their is one customer in the restaurant . won 't be going back
0	when i mentioned that the menu and their webpage said 15 dollars for delivery he told me " today the delivery is 30 dollars , if you want it order more . " i hung up the phone. was rude , curt and tried to change the print on their menu that i printed from their site . will not eat there ever , and i work very close . their loss . try jade garden , at least they take your order and don 't try to screw you because their policy does not fit them that day ,
0	i wasn 't worried about that so much however , the ramen i ordered had a bad taste . i had previously been to a few places and really enjoyed the ramen so i 'm not sure if i ordered the wrong flavor for me or what . i just hated it and after a few bites , i just pushed it aside and paid my bill . even though i hardly ate anything , they gave me my bill and didn 't even ask if i wanted something different or what . so , i will not be going back there .
0	delivery of sushi rolls took way longer than appropriate and were incorrect twice . for two girls to eat 5 rolls of sushi for all you can eat took two hours . the all you can eat price is way too high for the service and quality of food .
0	after my family ordered everyone except my plate came out . they kept saying " so sorry " ! my family finished eating and i still don 't have my plate ! as iam asking for the check , they finally bring out my food ! " so sorry " ! si sorry for you noodle house 3 ! never going back again ! lousy service ! !
0	we were told no because " it 's too hard for the servers to get the sushi from the bar .. they don 't like it crowded . " so i can 't sit at the sushi bar in a sushi restaurant ? no problem , i know plenty of places that i can ! needless to say , don 't waste your time .
0	was told it would be 30 mins until delivery . after 25 mins got a call back saying i was too far outside the coverage area and they couldn 't deliver . the only option they gave me was $ 3 credit for the delivery charge other wise i still had to pay . 25 minute drive later i finally got food , which was mediocre at best . sesame chicken wasn 't even mixed , just a cup of sauce and fried chicken pieces . needless to say , won 't ever order from there again !
0	min on the phone waiting time and then got hung up on we will take our business elsewhere . horrible customer service
0	when i was paying i find out that lunch that advertised online is not the same , promised spring roll and soup is not included . i didn 't like my order , pork was sometimes hard to chew . price was good , but quality disappointing .
0	slow service , very long wait for anything , from sake to food . tiny , skinny rolls were an embarassment . after waiting 40 minutes , we finally received something , the yakisoba was cold , the chicken was heavily overcooked to being so dry , it felt like cardboard . we sent the dish back , at the point the appetite is dead and you just want to pay and go . never again , what has happened to the place ?
0	i was very disappointed to find that there portion sizes have been cut down . # 31 white chicken breast lacked the quality egg noodle i substituted for rice noodle the broth was much more oily then before and what happened to the chicken ? ? ? fresh spring rolls lost there fat and full zest and the service seems to have no care there guest get thirsty . i much prefer this place over any other phō restaurant as i would drive 30 minutes just to eat at this place . i have tested this place out numerous times before writing this review and sad to say this place has no longer captured my bu $ ine $ $
0	i use the app frequently so can only assume it was the restaurant 's failure . after just arriving in town and with no rental car to go elsewhere to eat , their mistake was not a good start to my trip .
0	not only did my friend and i wait for over 40 minutes for our appetizer , but we did not end up receiving half of our order . the waiter , however , had the audacity to add it on to our bill . to top it off , we were the only two guests in the restaurant who were given plastic utensils and cups because the restaurant " ran out . " needless to say we will be skipping this place next time we visit the plaza .
0	we tried some of our favorites ; green curry and pad thai , which was ordinary at best ( the chicken was dry and the dishes were overall tasteless ) ! after dinner , we chatted for a few minutes , only to find the owner or manager ( whoever he was ) standing by the front door announcing that they were closing . it was 10 minutes before 9pm . that was strange since the hours posted said they were open until 9 . translation : get the hell out ; we were appalled ! needless to say , we won 't be back , but still wondering why they were playing music fit for a mexican restaurant , not thai ?
0	this place is hood ! ! it 's extra ghetto inside with the worst service ever . i really can 't complain though when the dishes are soo cheap . the food just wasn 't good . in fact , i would say it 's pretty disgusting . i ordered a broccoli and chicken dish , and the chicken wasn 't fresh at all . i was actually scared to eat the meat ! ! everything inside was sticky , dusty and dirty . they definitely need a makeover with the decor , food and service .
0	i told a waitress . she said " oh , " killed it and went on like nothing happened . never comming back . it was winter when this happened so no way that roach came from the street .
0	three days later i 'm still feeling it . i 've eaten all over the world , including many third world countries and have never had food poisoning that bad . i won 't go into the details but let 's just say it wasn 't pretty .
0	how incredibly disappointing it was . this will set back korean food for generations . and don 't try to eat there during the summer . there is no shade , no misters , nothing . just horrible food in a horrible spot .
0	i believe i have food poisoning from this place . never again will i eat at this place .
0	after eating dinner at linda , s modern thai last night , i would not refer anyone who like , s good thai food to go there.the food is plan , and the portions are very small , well the price , s are high. dinner with two dish , s and a small salad was around seventy five dollar , s.we had to pick up food on the way home as we were still not full.there are so many better thai place , s in toronto .
0	i believe they put too much msg on their food . i will never go back here again .
0	they did not cook the chicken through and both my friend and i were sick for weeks .
0	unfortunetly , their bad service ( see other comments ) is turning into terrible service . after a long wait , they will insist something is ' just coming out ' of the kitchen then disappear for 10 minutes . and take out , don 't get me started they don 't even pretend to listen to spice levels or give reasonable pickup time estimates . if you order one thing mild and one thing spicey , they get it wrong almost every time . their food is pretty good and i really like the vegatable curry but the constantly ' lying ' staff makes this a no-go restaurant .
0	it was a bit too greasy and i could not get the lingering taste from my mouth even after brushing my teeth .
0	i was literally sick for over 2 weeks and had to receive medical attention . i became severely dehydrated and also contracted a bacterial infection . a complaint was filed with the county . looking a little deeper into their inspection history , i am not surprised i got as sick as i did . i have been eating sushi for literally 30 years , and have never had any bad experiences . this was horrendous !
0	unfortunately , the restaurant was closed more than hour before it is supposed to close and i did not get to enter even though i arrived well within the time frame that the business advertises its open hours .
0	i have enjoyed pei wei over the years and will continue to be a customer ; however , just not at this particular location ( 742 e glendale ave ) .
0	i wanted to treat my parents to a nice dinner . musashi seated us promptly but soon thereafter was told any sushi or sashimi would take a min of 40min ! ! ! my parents of course said it was ok and ordered a bento box . i ended up eating nothing and felt like so bummed out that i couldn 't order half the menu . never eating japanese in charlotte ever again ! !
0	it is not as good as everyone claims . it regular food nothing special . will never go back .
0	after finding hair in the second order i did have stomach problems from the chicken that was in that meal i do think the health department needs to know about this place and investigate what is going on there .
0	i 'm allergic to shellfish so that 's a big no for me . won 't ever go back to this place
0	that was more fun than eating at pf changs . i wouldn 't eat here again for all the tea in china .
0	not only did i not get an apology , but the manager or owner questioned whether it was their food , and where was my doctor 's bill ? he also asked if i even knew what food poisoning was . not only did i waste my time going back , hoping they could save another customer , i didn 't even get an apology !
0	ordering through just-eat , i was not aware of their incompetence just yet . an hour after ordering i received a phone call from the restaurant telling me that the food was almost ready and it would be another 30 minutes . 45 minutes later . i get another call telling it will be 15 minutes more . i had not yet searched the location of monteiro , and as i did i realized that it was a 7 minute drive from where i am . it took this restaurant 2 hours to deliver to me . they are 7 minutes away . awful service . and the food , honestly not so bad . pretty plain , but not necessarily bad . would not recommend .
0	i specially asked for front goat leg & all i got was bones with very less meat on it & on top of it , it was chewy and quality was low grade .... one-advise please avoid this place or check what you are getting
0	las time we went the place smelled very fishy and most of our nigiri was fishy . we had by far the poorest service i have ever had in any restaurant in vegas . the next day i was sick . no more sushi koma for us .
0	the $ 125 we paid for 2 rolls , a few beers , and miso and edamame might not have felt like such a rip off if the amount of fish in our rolls was even detectable . the lemon slices on top of my salmon roll were thicker than the salmon slices on top of the roll . nasty . starting to lose faith in yelp .
0	the fish quality suddenly dropped from well above average to blah , no better than t & t supermarket sushi . what a disappointment . furthermore , about 2 hours after eating there , food-poisoning ensued . ps : what 's with the serving of melted green tea ice cream dessert ? definitely will stop going there for good .
0	this was most definitely the second worse thai food i have ever had . the curries were absolutely horrible , the fried rice was under-cooker , and absolutely tasteless . the spring rolls seemed stale and were cold . the crazy noodles were heavily al-dente , and drove me crazy - being bland ! ! ! i would not recommend this place to anyone . also , from a customer service perspective , i have never been to a restaurant that includes a sleeping 17 month old as an individual to account towards a party of 6 for 18 % gratuity . absolute rubbish !
0	wrong sauce was cold and salad was normal . probably won 't be back
0	i decided to drive up to have a taste . this place is terrible . i don 't even want to waste my energy writing this review , because we should of known this place isn 't even the real " din tai fung . " the word " din " at this restaurant has a extra " g " in it ! p.s. stop calling it xiao long bao 's , these are obviously " tan bao 's " which translates to " soup dumplings . " anyone that is shanghainese that was brought up in shanghai should know this . p.s.s. this place should be closed down like those shops on canal st . nyc for bootlegging the real din tai fung .
0	upon entering the restaurant the hostess quickly grabbed menus and walked us to a table exclaiming " we close at 3 , so hurry up . " instead of being rudely rushed , we decided to leave . yelp has the hours for this restaurant listed as open until 10 pm on saturday - we aren 't the type of people to walk into a restaurant as it is closing and demand service . however , the staff at pittsburgh thai need to understand that politeness goes a long way . we would have come back to try again had the message been delivered in a courteous manner . good food doesn 't trump good manners , folks .
0	i ordered curry chicken and baked pork chops with rice . not only did it come with one piece of pork chop , the meat was of poor quality , it was fatty . the curry chicken though was above average- proportion was reasonable , and the sauce was addictive . think i 'd only go back if i have severe curry cravings , since this place is not that far from mine .
0	they sat us right in front of the place in the restaurant and pretty much forgot about us . i had to turn around and flag the waiters down twice for refills and then again for the check . this was strange as the place was pretty dead .
0	after a long day of sightseeing in niagara falls , i was so looking forward to this meal . i ordered the pickled cabbage and leek pork dumplings . all i have to say , disappointment . the restaurant should be northeastern chinese style where pickled cabbage is an essential dish for every family . the dish tasted nothing like home . instead of natural sour , the taste came from vinegar . there was way too much garlic in the dish too . leek dumplings had way too much pork and there was barely any leek taste . i truly hope the markham one is better . : (
0	either everyone writing awesome reviews about this place has never had sushi before , or they are getting paid to tell everyone how awesome and amazing this place it . the food was very bland and didn 't look as though it was the best quality . i even tried out the garlic chicken per all the reviews , while that was pretty decent it was nothing to rave about . even though this place is right around the corner and really quick to get to , i dont think i will ever be going back to it .
0	i didn 't have breakfast before and no dinner last night . it definitely caused by the unclean food that i ordered there . i have been there few times and i was ok but yesterday was horrible for me . i cannot say they does that every time however i will not go back again . if my friend ask me why i stop go there i will tell them the truth . this is my first time to write a review . i was very disappointed with a such high rate place .
0	i remained ill for the rest of my vacation in las vegas . i have never gotten this ill from sushi . clearly , i had been infected with a parasite . to make matter worse , i left a cash tip ( for which the waitress was very happy ) , but they still charged me for a tip on my card . i figured this out after i verified the charge . not only did i get sick , but i was cheated as well . if i could give this place 0 stars , i would .
0	the ramen i had was beyond gross . the noodles were extremely overcooked , the meat had no taste and the broth was disgustingly bland and flavorless . i 've had the sushi here before and it was ok , but this experience has given me reason to never go back . i eat a lot of ramen and this was by far the worst i 've ever had . i left 95 % of the bowl untouched and still paid for it . never again ...
0	jook ( congee , rice porridge ) . a staple . ridiculously simple to make with the ingredients of rice , water , and a bit of ginger . it was incredible how terrible the bowl was . the price was good . the appearance was fine , but the taste set a new record and not a good one . it was straight narsty . there was no rice taste whatsoever . the only thing i could think was that they use mostly rice flour instead of rice to make it . maybe i ordered the wrong things , but i don 't think i 'll be giving it another shot . it is certainly not among the best hong kong dining in the valley .
0	fine then , no more saigon for us ... there 's plenty of pho places now out here on the sw side . thank you for being stingy ... should be minus star !
0	i decided to call to see what 's up . " we sent your order to another store . " they said . " why ? " i asked . " because you 're 6 miles away and we only go 5 miles . " ( i think he said ) . then what the f * * k did you take my order ? the food was sub par when it finally did arrive . unprofessional and cold . just nasty . i was excited about the fried crab sticks because i 'm from ny and we eat those a lot back home . i won 't be ordering from them again .
0	i still want to give it a try . and this is the first time we go to this place . we will never go back . it just waste my money and time and everything else . none of the food taste good to me . no wonder why it was so empty when we first arrive there ! next time when you walk into an empty restaurant , you should know why . don 't waste your money !
0	she even reached and started counting coins while i was still in the middle of giving her tips . extremely disrespectful staff . i have never been to an establishment where the staff physically counted the tips for you . this restaurant lost all my business . would not come back again . i 'm sure you can see that other people have had the same issue as me if you read some of the other reviews . 1 / 5 stars .
0	this restaurant was definitely downhill . on friday , there was only one table of customers . a waitress push us to order more food and more expensive food . side dish were so old , and main dish were not good either . looks like they will close the business soon .
0	the quality has gone from good to more than worse . service has super slow . servers seem as though they are serving time and not happy to be there . the owners need to return back to quality and hire happier staff
0	food was pretty dismal , didn 't taste fresh , varied in temperature and meat was tough . sauces were greasy and overly salty , and just drenched over everything . pancakes with the moo shu were stale and dry , inedible really . meat was chewy and the pork actually tasted off . as someone else mentioned , egg roll tasted of old oil and was soaked in grease . it 's also worrying that the food arrives so quickly , probably sat in the back in a large vat and quickly reheated in a microwave or something . staff are friendly ish but clearly offer a quick in and fast out sort of experience- best to find alternative chinese food in the area !
0	telling me i 'm " inexperienced " when it comes to sushi and i have a bad memory . very poor in taste . it only reaffirmed my decision to never return to this rude disgusting restaurant .
0	service and good was way off tonight . i could get better at a panda express
0	went to pick up the food . stood there for more than 10 minutes before anyone would acknowledged me . then when they found out it was for pick up , they started sitting the dine in customers who came in after me again and again before i had to stop them and said " hey , i don 't have all day . the food is sitting right there behind you . " we won 't be coming back to this place .
0	the servers after 12am seem to literally hate their lives when working . they are rude and mess with your orders . i had ordered 2 portions of brisket and we literally got 7 portions instead ... lol gave us spoiled corncheese and you know overall it sucked . it all sucked . never coming back . mr lee you suck for habing your business run by headless chickens who run around
0	i have always had an amazing experience at basil and their sister restaurant lotus in charleston . the charlotte location fell way short . the food was bland and the portions were off from what i 'm used to . we went for dinner and in charleston the lunch portion is more than the charlotte dinner portions . i ordered the jalapeño mule and it was one of the worst drinks i have ever had . the waitress acted like she didn 't want to be there and my water was empty for most of the trip . sad to say basil will have to stay a charleston only tradition .
0	this place made me sick and i would not suggest anyone to go out here .
0	and your men 's bathroom is filthy . take some pride in your business and clean things up .
0	this location used to have a fantastic management and staff was friendly . it seems that isn 't the case anymore . i 'll look for pho somewhere else , thanks .
0	large sashimi platter looks like a " small . " never coming back ! ! a waste of money ! !
0	it was announced last week that noodles and company planned to close 55 of its 510 stores nationwide . also closed are the locations in monroeville , peters township , washington , and wexford .
0	the tuna was dark colored smelled / tasted very fishy , the avocado was browning , the sushi rice was too wet , the salmon was mushy , and the cream cheese was curdling . the tuna alone is enough to quite literally make someone sick . this establishment should not be selling food that is obviously expired . this is the fault of the sushi chef for not taking mind to the food . i will not be returning here . even after letting the chef and our waitress know they still charged us . i can feel my stomach rumbling from the disgusting tuna .
0	after ordering in last night due to the snow storm in toronto ho lee chow had the nerve to bring the worst peices of scrap to my house i 've ever seen ( i won 't disrespect the word " food " ) the peices of scrap was so bad i had to bring it back to them and to my suprise i found the filthiest restaurant in toronto
0	the counter is covered with a layer of gray dust . super dirty place . i felt like throwing the food out . my daughter said to never bring her that food again . not tasty
0	although i could hear the microwaving sound , i couldn 't actually see what they were microwaving but regardless that doesn 't mean good news . minced pork rice ( $ 6.50 ) - this was super salty 3 cup chicken rice ( $ 7.50 ) - this was really salty as well . this dish was not appetizing at all . the chicken was like chopped into small pieces , which was odd because traditionally it 's supposed to be served with chicken bone so the meat is more tender . the chicken meat was dry and didn 't have the real 3 cup chicken flavor . the food was horrible . i definitely will not come back .
0	the food is just way too sweet and there 's nothing on the menu that isn 't a sugar bomb . panda express , which i 'm not a fan of , is so much better . please do yourself a favor and stay away from this fake asian food designed to taste like a candy bar . what are they thinking putting chicken , coated in a sugary sauce on a salad . ick ! here 's what we got . an appetizer , two entrees and two drinks for almost $ 30 . way overpriced and tastes awful . never , ever again .
0	while i appreciate the " traditional " japanese ambiance , this place was simply run-down and uninspiring . the service was slow and they got my order wrong , even though we talked about it in some detail as i made a few changes , given my allergies . the food was overpriced . the miso soup was tasteless , the shashimi was not fresh or tender , and the teriyaki beef was nothing to write home about . hands down , nami is one of the worst japanse restaurants i have been to , since arriving in toronto .
0	went back to the front of the restaurant and no sign . waited at the front for 5 minutes before asking 3 different workers if we could be seated . when they took us to our table the workers seemed sketchy and they had negative attitudes . honestly we were afraid they might mess with our food that we left after 5 minutes after being seated and no waitress to say hi or take our drink order ... sucks mainly went because we saw a board advertised on fremont street for $ 3.99 shrimp and decided to get a snack . wouldn 't have gone in if we didn 't see the advertisement , very disappointed and won 't ever visit again .
0	bummer ... the smell just killed it for us right from the get go . immediately , upon walking in the door , the pungent smell of backed up sewer hit us like a ton-of-bricks . we did a 180 and walked right out . no way i could sit through a meal here while breathing that funk . get the smell worked out and we will give you another shot , tasty thai .
0	we ordered two sushi rolls , both with surprise ingredients . to have items in our rolls not listed , was not pleasant . the iced green tea was also not good . service was slow , and even though the establishment was pretty empty , our last entree was served thirty minutes after our first . they had forgotten to put the order in . when the wait staff went to check on it , after they had given us our bill , we could hear the cooks laughing for about five minutes . in the future , i will go to blue wasabi , where the service and food is always above par .
0	i ordered the beef broth with seafood . if the two shrimp , one fish ball cut into 8 pieces that were hard as a rock , and three tiny pieces of squid considered a seafood dish than this is for you . definitely not for me . my daughter ordered the beef broth with all beef fixins . the tendon was so hard they literally must of just thrown it in just to say it was in there . and the spring rolls that are hard to mess up were sooooo greasy . never coming back here !
0	i had to flag them to even get water then after 10 minutes later i flagged her so we can get a menu so we can order our food , priced stupidly high and the quality of the meat did not look great . we just ended up walking out and trust me no one noticed because they just truly didn 't care to tend to us .
0	i use to go here all the time . i haven 't gone in awhile , so thanks to all the reviews , and finding out the original owners are no longer there , i guess i won 't be returning .
0	ordered a beef noodle soup . nothing to write home about . except that it was effing oily . then ordered a cold chicken noodle . ended up with chicken rice . okay ... i guess it was my mistake for trying to find asian food court type food in north york . i should driven to any food court in scarborough and would have gotten similar food at the same price while getting better quality , quantity , decor and service .
0	after reading assorted bad reviews on yelp i somehow lost my mind and decided to try it because i really wanted some chinese food - when you walk in everything seems nice but not only was our booth about to fall apart but all of the food that was ordered for all four people at my table was completely void of any taste or flavor so much so that eating air would 've had more flavor i definitely will not be back i gave them one star because i couldn 't give them less
0	received the food and it was missing food that apparently i had not ordered ! ! ! ! i read it from a list ...... the food is sub par .. ordered wonton soup .... got all the items that go in wonton soup ..... no soup.called about it and she said that i had not ordered it why did i get what goes in the soup .. .. if i didn 't order it got something that had pineapple pieces in it ..... the lady said " we don 't have anything with pineapples with it ..... why are there pineapple pieces in it then ..... dont waste your time your money ..... there 's plenty of other places ...
0	however , i was disappointed with every aspect of the meal . the ambience matched the quality of food ..... terrible . upon entering , we were welcomed by seeing 4-6 tables of people . each table looked like it was covered in vomit . turns out that was the shrapnel from the food , but was foreshadowing of our meal . we ordered the " get your feet wet combo , " which was like turd in a bag sprinkled with hot sauce . eating with plastic gloves on is not my ideal friday night plan , but was probably the only saving grace as it was the only thing between my hands and the un-deveined shrimp poop chute .
0	i 've never felt more uncomfortable in a restaurant in my life . the hours clearly state they are open until 10pm , yet by 8 : 30 they started turning up lights , sweeping the floor next to us while we ate , trying to signal is to leave . how ignorant ... we put up with your over priced , poor quality , greasy , generic food so we could bring our own bottle of wine and relax in peace . we even tipped 18 % and then you show us your appreciation by basically pushing us out the door . never again ... we won 't be back !
0	after reading reviews figured i 'd give it a shot ordered cantonese chow mein and hot and sour soup my usually order ( 28.76 $ total ) waste of money the 7.99 hot and sour soup from ding tai fung is 100x better the chow mien smelt fishy and noodles were cooked in old grease i wouldn 't complain if it was much cheaper but for 30 $ was way below my expectations i defiantly will not be back much better restaurants in that plaza
0	how moo is better just confuzzles me . i admit the beef is quite tender but the soup is just bland and no where close to being any spicy . what a let down . their pan friend pork and chives dumplings is nothing to write home about either .
0	after reading reviews on this place , thought i would take my family here to give it a try. but after driving in circles a few times , we realized that this place had closed down - couldn 't find it at all !
0	picture shown was supposed to be shrimp and broccoli . it was shrimp with mixed vegetables in a white creamy sauce . it was not the typical shrimp with broccoli and the rice tasted old . aside from this we ordered crab rangoon appetizer and they were awful . there was literally no filling inside it was just a fried shell . won 't be ordering from here again .
0	the bun bo hue was the worst i have ever had . won 't be returning here again .
0	i was do disappointed with the thai chicken that i ended up eating left overs verses what i ordered . epic failure !
0	we ordered lollipop chicken ( as the last reviewers raved about it ) , chicken corn soup , spicy cauliflower , pakora . the lollipop chicken was raw inside . we called back the restaurant to complain . the lady who picked up the phone refused to acknowledge that they did a mistake and insisted that the chicken was cooked properly . extremely poor service . the rest of the food was not impressive . after the treatment we had , we would not recommend this place . please note that this happened in the spring . we tried it again recently to give a fair review , service and food were both poor .
0	otani did not in any way meet those expectations . i tried the # 2 ( ramen with pork belly ) that was one of their top sellers . the pork belly itself was far and away the worst i 've ever had - borderline dry , not particularly tender and no where near the flavor you would want in fresh pork belly . the corn in the meal tasted like it was poured directly from a can into my bowl , there was nothing remotely fresh tasting about the meal . there are plenty of options in the city for great ramen , otani is definitely not one of them .
0	after reading the questionable body language of the two reps at the front that took and served my order , i don 't trust or feel comfortable eating or receiving food from this restaurant ( this particular location ) .
0	unfortunately my experience was very disappointing . from the wait staff to the food , i was not pleased . the staff ignored my table , and attended others , that arrived after us . there was no explanation of the " traveling carts " and once we requested a cart to come by , the food was cold , over processed , and very bland . we tried a variety of steamed and pan / fried dishes , and they were all disappointing . i will not return . on a side note , i look to charlotte.com to see what restaurants / dives / etc. are in charlotte to try and this did not live up to what i read .
0	the guy on the phone was rude . so i decided not to go to the place . angry people stay away from the phone ! ! !
0	first off the ayce menu you can 't get all of the rolls and nigiri and so many of the rolls are exactly the same.second the quality of nigiri was not good , the fish tasted old and warm.the rolls had no flavor unless you call the rolls being drenched in sauce flavor.maybe if you just ordered their random hamburgers and sush it would be good but i dont recommended the sushi . the only reason i 'm giving them a 1 star besdies not being able to give it a zero is that there potstickers were good . definitely wont be coming back to waste $ 61 on old bland sushi .
0	unfortunately we left over 3 / 4 of our food in the trash . we had egg flour soup , crab puffs and chicken with broccoli . the soup had almost a chemical taste to it ... and the crab puffs were 99 % creme cheese with scallion , no crab . at first i was hopeful when tasting the chicken with broccoli , until my second bite was all grissley-crunch and it wasn 't the broccoli . we ate over lunch and spent about $ 13.50 . i now wish i had twice that amount back because i was not able to finish my afternoon ... i 'm home with a terrible stomach ache .
0	it was pan fried with the thin layer of skin , but there was an aftertaste of soap water . which i should have known , since the glass of water they served us was disgusting ! we had ordered the jumbo sumo ramen - beware , it is a very big bowl of noodles , which we did not expect . the sumo ramen came with a half boil egg , seaweed , pork belly , and other veggies . the noodles and pork belly was good . soup was tasteless . definitely would not go back again .
0	i was told " i don 't think so . " ( ( click ) ) the guy hung up ! wow , he didn 't even ask what items i was calling about . i was shocked and did not bother with them any further .
0	the fact that no asians were eating there when i was should have been a clue . the food was absolutely the worst excuse for chinese i have ever had the displeasure of not being able to finish . i suppose there are trade offs . the old jade house had great food but terrible service . this place has terrible everything . i give them 6 months max and they will be done unless they hire a new kitchen staff .
0	the best i can say is that the woman on the phone and the delivery man were nice . it is by far the worst chinese food we have ever had . we ordered the combo appetizer . the only decent item on it was the crab rangoon . we also ordered mooshu pork and pork fried rice . we wound up tossing it after trying both . what a waste of $ 30.00 . buyer beware ! i will drive to the section of town where we used to live and take it home from our old chinese restaurant from now on . taking no more chances !
0	my wife and myself wanted boba tea . total came up to be $ 8 . too bad they have a $ 10 minimum charge on the card . wtf honey buns . this is 2015 . why are people still doing this ? my wife made me order more stuff to get to $ 10 but they have lost me as a customer forever . and we drink a lot of boba tea .
0	it 's now 5 hours later and i 'm laying in bed praying for a quick death for the suffering to end . i wouldn 't say it 's food poisoning judging from the symptoms , but there 's definitely something in there that disagreed with my system ( msg , poor quality meat , fat , weird sauce ... ? ? ) . let this review serve as my obituary if i don 't make it through the night .... needless to say i will not be retuning there .
0	we ordered 2 bowls of pho and we were very disappointed 1 ) they brought a plate of soy bean sprout and the basil leaves . the bean sprouts were not fresh and the basil leaves were all had black spot in almost each leaf . 2 ) the soup is supposed to be the soul of pho dish , it was watery with no taste of beef soup at all
0	the servers were nice and the tea was good but that 's about it . i went for lunch and they had only been open about 30 minutes which is how i explained away the empty restaurant to myself . i tried a lunch special , pan fried beef , and i was extremely disappointed . the beef had a slimy texture to it and my egg roll was super oily . won 't be going back and definitely won 't be recommending it to anyone . i should have had a v8 . : - /
0	and they watched us eat our food , i _ _ _ _ _ _ _ hate that .
0	the food has no flavor what so ever . dishes seemed to have been cooked seperatly from the sauce or other flavoring spices and then just before it is brought out the sauce it thrown on top of the dish .
0	as i entered through the door , i realized i made a mistake . the place was just crowded with indian handicrafts , which instead of giving an ethnic look seemed to be a misfit . the seating appeared not cozy but just as if u r sitting in a narrow street . i started with an appetizer , the pappri chaat which gave me such a hard time eating it all , that i could not even finish half the plate and decided to leave . not a good experience . won 't recommend at all .
0	while some of the food is okay , what i had wasn 't that tasty . i asked for spicy in my dish and it barely tasted like they added anything . the interior is nice and the doors open to the square , very nice touch . if i could give them a zero i would ... just for lack of being clean . just plain gross .
0	what was quickly becoming a new favorite very quickly became a we will never call again . the long wait and cold food could have been fixed with good customer service .... but that didn 't happen either ... the owner patrick personally delivered the cold food then refused to make it right . let that lack of customer service speak for itself 50.00 for cold food and a owner who thinks that it 's ok to not fix it . if you decide to try and the same thing happens to you ...... you have been warned
0	as a consultant who flies as many as 198 times per year , i 'll be banning this place and telling all my fellow consultants to nix this place as well !
0	when i called to tell them they didnt pick up 5 phone calls . this could have been a very serious reaction . there was also shrimp in on of the soups that was vegetarian .
0	we gave them an extra 10 minutes before going to pick the food up , and still waited over 10 minutes in the lobby before even being greeted , and they didn 't give us all of our food .
0	before i even finished my friend 's address she said ' oh too far ' once she let me finish the address , then she agreed we are within their delivery area . during my order i tell her i want " pad thai " ( i pronounced it just like it is spelled ) . she didn 't understand , and i said pad thai again . and then screams at me and says " you 're wrong it is pronounced ' p-hut thai ' not pad thai . " i continue on with my order and then she tells me they are out of beef ! total failure . never ordering from there again .
0	it was terrible ! they didn 't even have chicken available when we ate there . definitely do not recommend .
0	and the people are so nice there and that food was good , but .....
0	keep in mind we arrived around 5 : 30 on a tues . the wait and $ was so not worth it , a huge disappointment . the line for seafood was long , the meat looked like it had been sitting around , lots of labels missing so you just don 't know what stuff is , very sad .
0	they made ua wait for an hour without serving us any roll as a strategy for people to eat less . worst thing is that when we complained the ignorant manager told us yo go if we didn 't want to wait instead of accepting that what they were doing is a rip off . of course we will never come back again ..
0	the new interior is confusing ... and the sushi chefs are a bunch of ransoms . they have a new " we can 't seat you until your whole party is seated " rule , and wouldn 't let us sit because my mom was still getting the baby out of the car . the food was okay and the rolls are all the same and a small selection . my tuna poki still had fish scales on it . the eel was dry , and the uni was spoiled . the only good roll was the spider roll . when i tried to pick up my baked mussel i ordered , it burned my index finger and its now blistered . i will not be back .
0	it was nothing of the sorts for me . i got the vegetarian tom kha soup and a bag of crispy noodles . the crispy noodles were definitely not fresh and i had requested that the soup be made with only certain vegetables and it came with a slew of others i 'm not favorable about . i 've had this kind of soup in atlanta , and it 's to die for ! this one , not so much . didn 't even finish it .
0	good thing i had some ass & sour soup to wash down that fish and bile taste . i went out to the caesers palace swanky pool and tried to drown myself for paying more than $ 30 for the two amazingly slimey dishes . come to this place if you love eating fish crap ! cj out ! !
0	like other reviewers have mentioned rolls were falling apart , ribs lacked flavour , some food didn 't come at all and pieces of sashimi are fairly small . it 's definitely not worth the $ 25.99 per person on a weekend .
0	unfortunately they have not improved . i asked the waiter to halve the oil in my food and i still got noodles soaked in oil . see attached picture . the red liquid in the bottom of the dish is oil not source ! so if you want to be super unhealthy . eat there !
0	bad service , didn 't have half the things on the menu and honestly nothing like the old khao san which was our go to thai place .
0	ordered for my coworkers and i chicken shawarma dinner which the rice was terrible it was hard almost like little pebbles . the chicken was clearly overcooked and dry i honestly did not enjoy my meal at all for lunch . not worth the 10 $ . been to other places that are way better and a lot cheaper than this place . purely just out of convience since its located down the street from the office : )
0	dirty table , bland tasting orange chicken ( had better at panda express ) , beer that was dark at the bottom , and the waitress taking my phone to use the groupon were just some of the issues i had . save yourself the trouble and go to a place that isn 't a bar that serves bland / gross chinese .
0	so after placing $ 64.00 worth of food in a cart i enter my card # and nope to far . i call back and ask why they can 't take my card and order . she said the bank won 't allow them to take a card over the phone . i actually am a senior account executive and sign up 20 + new customers a month for merchant accounts . if this were my business i would not lose $ 60 orders because of poor service from another company . email me if you want to double your profit otherwise i 'll spend my money elsewhere !
0	had the teriyaki bowl and both times was barely warm . the only thing barely above warm was the brown rice . that is to say both times . i even mention to them that the cold chicken was not a good idea to serve to customers .
0	the broth has improved from two years ago , it is no longer as diluted . however , service seem to have gotten worse . the waitress placed the bill on our table half way through our meal to rush us out , my sister wasn 't even half done her bowl of noodles yet . how rude . i also found a bug in my bowl near the end : ( they don 't wash their veggies thoroughly enough .
0	if they can screw uo the tea , how can we expect good food .
0	the sashimi was great but the slices were so big you literally had to cut them down to bit size pieces . the rolls didn 't even stay together & they were golf ball size in diameter . to add insult , i didn 't even get everything i ordered . i will never go back and i have no clue why everyone is giving them such high reviews .
0	they hadn 't even made it yet ! i asked if they would be delivering it for free and they offered a % 25 discount . cancelled order .
0	the girl responded with she was sorry or order would be up after another order popped up and it was people who had just got there ! she then offered us potstickers i refused and asked for a refund saying i don 't understand how they do things and she said " well we aren 't a fast food place " well no joke but when 4 other families who came in after my family get served there is issues ! never coming back here ! worst experience ever ! ! if there was a way not to give any stars l would .
0	getting a bowl of white rice thats was well under cooked . i will not be back .
0	the curry arrived with the vegetables in the container and the liquid in a bag . aside from a slight plasticity taste , it was alright . get back to me in the morning and i 'll let you know if my stomach agrees . the drunken noodles were completely sober and probably just cardboard sprinkled with pepper . i 'm talking bone dry . the tom kha had hair in it and a few other ingredients i wasn 't expecting . the vegetarian egg rolls had ( chicken ? ) meat in them . this might actually be the worst $ 50 i 've ever spent . ever .
0	i was told they ran out of beefeater rolls that is why i had not recieved my order ? ? ? why wasnt i contacted i asked i was told because she was too busy . pretty sad all of the other locations are fantastic ! ! ! maybe its poor management .
0	the girl making the sushi was so of putting . all she did was complain about how " busy " it was while giving her coworkers attitude . when i did get a refund , there was no apology . this is why places like this fail and close down , customer service .
0	not so much as a drink order being taken . staff was apathetic and passively rude . cleanliness was mediocre at best .
0	tried calling and i got hung up on . drove down there and demanded a refund . i was told the credit card machine was down . we will see if i get a refund .
0	however , according to yelp and google maps , we are 13 min from their location . unprofessional and rude .
0	absolutely ridiculous . why should i leave a tip for unsatisfying service ? never returning . update : we returned for a desperate meal and found hair in the pho and an alive fly in the bean sprout that comes with the pho . disgusting and disappointed , again .
0	food was substandard and nothing really stood out . we had charsiu , beef broccoli , house fried noodles , house fried rice , and cold ginger chicken . the chicken was unappetizing and flavorless , and i think even pandas ( which is not real chinese food ) would have done these dishes better . an automatic 15 % gratuity was added to our bill because we had 6 people , but for the lack of service we got i really wish they hadn 't tacked that on . so disappointing . we 'll venture elsewhere for chinese cuisine in the future .
0	they forgot my part of my order . it 's been more than an hour again and still haven 't get my complete food . first time i order here and last time too .
0	after finally taking a bite it turned out to be cold .. after this i went to the toilet and the toilet seat was literally covered in feces it was absolutely disgusting .
0	at least have the courtesy to make an announcement to the crowd when there 's a line 20 people deep . ridiculous .
0	stone cold food i should mention . the thai wings and fried shrimp were just huge blots of fried cold batter .... lots of dried out boiled rice and two very small containers of tasteless , limp cold food . then they hit me up for a $ 4 delivery charge ............ go to weera - heard excellent things and will try it next time . kung fu thai - you suck ! ! !
0	i ordered my food only to get home and it was wrong . avoid this location at all cost , i can 't believe they screwed up my meal after all that .
0	the dish i ordered looked nothing like what was pictured . the dish pictured had thick chow mein noodles. what i received was the skinny wavy top ramen . the spices where also very pungent and over the top . very disappointed to pay $ 15.95 for $ .25 noodles .
0	they could have told us at the time of the order . poor communication , poor planning . don 't wait an hour for your delivery only to be called at the time of the supposed delivery to be told they are out of food .
0	first impression was ugly decor , poor ventilation , and the fruits in the storage looked like they were rotting . but that has never stopped me from eating good quality food , so we went ahead and sat down . my wife was happy when she they had a young coconut drink . saw the dude pull it out of the rotting fruit section . i tried it and felt it was disgusting , my wife said it was good . egg rolls were terrible , and i ordered the special combination vermicelli and my wife ordered the egg roll vermicelli . long story short food was bland and not worth the price . i highly doubt we will ever visit this establishment again .
0	it really does give me an indication of what money can buy because quality certainly wasn 't on their priority list when opening a restaurant . i felt like pho-bomination they served me today was cooked in a toilet bowl after the violent passing of spring rolls and slim jim . mind you , i have eaten a fair share of pho places throughout the world , including in vietnam . i 'd be ashamed to serve this lukewarm soaked garbage with chunks of shoe leather to my own enemies . will i go back ? i would rather fallete a vagabond with a mild case of gonorrhea then put myself through another wasted meal at district one .
0	our low expectations were soon justified . our waiter could not find his book , the kitchen was out of tomatoes so my gf could not get the salad she ordered and our drinks never arrived . after 20 minutes of smelling a strong sewer gas we walked out . they probably still don 't know we left . stay away and let this place close . please .
0	when we told her were just having water she was shocked and said we needed to buy a pop with our half price sushi . i told her that we were nott informed of that by our waitress and we were finished so we did nott want the pops . the owner actually came back with the pops . the sushi was terrible and service was worse . there are may other places you can go for much better service and better sushi .
0	so i 'm going to rate there sanitation score seeing as i know the business of health inspections this business is the lowest i have ever stepped foot in ( 91 ) . you never want to eat at a restaurant that is below a 95.5 .... just sayin ' .
0	which was a nice place , very clean , our food took so long 45-60 min . for two pp and my 1 year old baby . my baby was getting tired and bored . even the manager thought we were done eating , he asked " can i get anything else for you , " i answered " we are just waiting for our dinner still , we haven 't started yet . " if the place had a movie netflix on the tv for entertainment , i think we would go back . but nah .... there so many thai food out there that this place is rated two thumbs down . taco shop next door looks good .
0	feelings aside . lunch was by far one of the worst dining experiences i have had in charlotte . came here with a group for a friends birthday . we were told they can 't accommodate a large group . finally getting seated it took 25min before we were noticed by our server . over an hour later no food . after finally receiving our food nothing about it was impressive , more or less just filled the void . took another 30min for checks and this concluded my first and last visit to ru san 's ...
0	i 've have tried several filipino buffets and this is by far the worst . small selection and what they do have is meats with a high fat to meat ratio ! heart attack on a plate no thanks ! talk about a rip off ! not risking my health to some eat here again . it 's definitely not worth another visit .
0	we were really looking forward to eating here reading all the good reviews . we went in hinting , it out first time there guy is literally looking at us not giving us time to order . so we just pick something of the menu . the guy prep our bowl then he hands it off to another employee to add the final ingredients . the girl there is reading the ingredients off the menu and and am pretty sure she did not even get it right . the smell of the tuna was strong and the taste even worse . it did not even have any mayo sauce like the menu said . so basically we took two bites and left . waste of $ 23.00 .
0	wtf ? i showed her my receipt when i ordered it and the payment .. even showed my boa account the funds being withdrawn .. i would say these people got to get it together but i 'm done with these guys . sad i was ordering pretty often and always giving them over 15 % tip .... lost a good consistent patron
0	the dishes i have tried were the japanese pan noodles with steak and the bangkok curry with pork . i don 't want to get into details as i feel i may just come off as ornery but suffice it to say the flavors were bland and predictable and the vegetables undercooked . i don 't believe i will ever ever return . the success of these type of restaurants could be the source of an interesting philosophical discussion on what people expect from their food , what are common food standards of homemade dishes , etc .
0	ordered online at 10 : 06 pm friday night , online website said open until 11 . waited one hour for food to be delivered , started calling at 11 : 05 , but nobody could be bothered to pick up the phone , though you know employees hadn 't left promptly at 11 . if my credit card is charged in the morning for food i never received , there will be hell to pay .
0	in its place is the new imperial one restaurant . please read my review of this fine new restaurant .
0	again again again this place is really starting to suck. i hate that this rallys keeps messing up my orders
0	asked the cook a question and instead of taking the 2 seconds it would have taken to open his mouth and answer he points to the cashier . there 's so much more i could write based on today 's visit but it would boarder on being cruel . food has not improved .
0	the sauces on the food were mediocre and the meat was dry and overcooked because of the precooked nature of the food .
0	soup was watery and tasteless 2 . food was overall very oil ( more than most places ) 3 . service was just bad -
0	one star is too generous for this place . first off , the guy had pre-cut slices ... and they were way too cold to be served , borderline frozen . i was livid . i asked him where he got his training ( rhetorical question i suppose ) . this was a while ago and i can only hope that they 've changed the place . if i think of the worst " sushi " experience i have ever had , this is it .
0	unhappy with the taste , texture and content . we complained to the mgr , dave , when we were in there a month ago and he said no changes . today we picked one up . soggy and tasteless . something has changed so we 're done . dave
0	a waiter just killed it and walked away . mediocre food , bad service , and unsanitary overall ! worst sam woo i 've been to ...
0	for 14.10 for the sampler i was expecting a little more food . i 'm a skinny guy it doesn 't take much to feed me but i was hungry after having left . so food meh , but price boo .
0	i 'm sorry to say that we didn 't get a chance to eat the food because the service was so abysmal ! maybe it was because we came towards the end of the lunch rush ( 1 : 00 pm ) . we were seated promptly and they asked about drinks and brought our drinks quickly . after 20 minutes no one had been around to take our order . even after attempting to make eye contact and flagging down our waiter , another 10 minutes came and went . we finally gave up , paid for our drinks and left . not good .
0	agreeing with jolean s. about horrible service. i ordered a special which the hostess told me about. after making my selection and waiting for some time , i was told that the sushi chef was not going to honor the special pricing. i was in the middle of texting a friend about the great specials this place had. i walked out as well without trying the food and recanted my rec. completely ridiculous .
0	agree with most , , , , bad .... won 't be back .... bland , tasteless , , , i wish i could give no star
0	i only have one word " terrible . " i guess i finally found the worst pho in town .
0	won 't order from new ho king again after yet another nasty experience dealing with extremely impolite people on the other end of the phone . perhaps the key to a good new ho king experience is to follow the lead of those who go when so inebriated that they won 't even remember the terrible service .
0	just left a completely empty place after my drink had flakes of some crude in the glass . they had only one bottle of red and nothing but muscato for white . the bar tender was nice and friendly but the place is a mess . hope first ward can get a place that can make it some day .
0	our server , olivia , was never to be found throughout the meal . we had to wait more than 30 minutes just for them to cut sashimi . everything else came out before the sashimi and when i went to ask the sushi bar , it was just sitting on the bar and of course olivia disappeared . the rolls here are tasteless and have way too much rice . the manager was sweet but it was my birthday and all she could do was say sorry . absolutely the worst .
0	not only did they mess up our order , they messed up the order before ours .
0	11 of us got food poisoning . not a very good birthday present . needless to say , we called the health department . they are going to be paying them a visit .
0	the lady cashier was extremely rude . she demanded things from me , never said please with any of her requests , and when i paid her $ 500 , she didn 't even bother to thank us . i thanked her 6-8 times over the course of our transaction and she never said " you 're welcome . " one of the most ridiculous customer service experiences i 've ever had !
0	we kindly asked the couple on the table in between to switch so we would be able to sit in adjacent tables . they were very kind to agree . however , the host , in a very rude manner , told us we could not switch because " this is my restaurant and i decide . " what was he thinking ? i can not believe the arrogance of this person ! ! !
0	for example ; the egg rolls included in the combo platter only had cabbage in them and were not crispy. same for the spring rolls which were barely filled with even cabbage the chicken and broccoli was very bland and not seasoned the portion sizes were less than what we are used to from other chinese food places on a positive side note , the service was polite and friendly . ( we have been told by coworkers that frankie 's wok in brecksville is a good area choice , so we will be trying them next ! )
0	why ? because a cockroach crawled out of our menu ! i do not recommend eating here if the roaches are crawling around so freely . the worst part was when we told the waitress she just shrugged and walked away from us . if i could leave no stars i would
0	: ( " - friend2016 . they turned all the grills down to the lowest settings and it now takes us 5ever to cook our meat . service is slow and orders are sometimes lost .
0	before even being seated one of the hostesses says " no , he can 't come in , he 's not wearing a long sleeve shirt . " we were all dressed up and one of our guy friends was wearing a tank , as he had just gotten off his flight . i have eaten at several high end restaurants in las vegas ( i am a local here ) and have never been treated so disrespectfully . we had a group of about 8 people , so they lost out on a big check . will not recommend this restaurant to any colleagues or visiting friends . just lost a customer .
0	most of us had the same problem . to bad , as it is close to our homes , and we thought it would be somewhere we would return to --not so we told the waitress but no one ever came out from the kitchen to address our concern . i can 't speak , about the other food that was ordered , by us just the hamburg .
0	the waitress was extremely upset that we had groupons and cursed at one of us when she found out we were using them . after she scanned all our vouchers she tells us that we are losing the remaining amounts left on the voucher . if we knew that before hand we all wouldnt have used our vouchers at once . overall terrible experience . she should have educated us about how to make the most of the groupon rather than getting upset and cursing . i 've never been so appalled with service in my entire life . the food was approrpriately priced for lunch and was pretty good . if it wasn 't for the terrible service we would be back again .
0	had much better foods else where . no good , not going to come back , over price but most importantly foods no good .
0	serious ? bad eggs rolls at a chinese rest ? main dish was good , but not enough to save the egg roll issue . finally , they served me an expired ( by 10 months ) coke zero . maybe my fault for ordering a coke zero .
0	i don 't know how to describe it , no matter how much sauce we put on our food it just didn 't taste like anything . but somehow it still tasted bad ? and the grill wasn 't hot enough , you could tell by the way all the food was sitting there like a lifeless lump so the vegetables were still kind of raw and none of flavors really cooked in . it was just awful . easily the worst dining experience i 've ever had in my three years in madison . also the chefs were kind of angry and unfriendly . the atmosphere was just super depressing .
0	this food is for the dying soul. so if you 're ready to go .... itadakimasu ! ( japanese for bon appetite )
0	this ones kindof the latter . i normally judge the restaurant by the smell first before eating , thank god i ordered take out because this place smelled awful . i ordered the green dragon , a special house one , california and got dumplings ( i thought they were veggie .. ) dumplings were just really bad . all the rolls tasted old , soft and had a weird fish smell ( i would understand if i ordered anything with fish but i didn 't ) the rolls also weren 't wrapped properly , falling apart before i even ate it . the only good thing that came from this was my tempura lol
0	daisaky is clean , new and empty . the sushi is fresh yet average. momiji is no better
0	the shrimps was tasty the rice clumpy and very starchy .. not worth the price
0	super mediocre fish . horrible service . gross salad dressing . don 't waste your time here .
0	the staff are rude , the customer service has not exist in this place ! i can 't believe what i 've experienced in here . please do yourself a favor and avoid this restaurant .
0	and overpriced ! we went there with great hopes of a good meal , we were , at best , underwhelmed . my husband had the ' fish & chips ' and i had the seafood noodles ... his was completely flavorless and mine was mis-seasoned in my opinion ( unless the goal was for the sauce to be gritty and on the almost dirty mushroomy plus very salty side . ) so unless you 've been here before and just love it ( if so , what are you ordering ! ? ? ) i don 't advise going ... unless you have money you 're dying to throw away . sauce is in the same area and a much nicer dining experience ! : )
0	" this has got to be one of the strangest japanese restaurants i have ever been in . first of all its ridiculously uninviting . one gigantic room with warehouse height ceilings and a bunch of tables and chairs . zero flair with no intimacy . i felt like we were dining in the middle of costco . unfortunately the layout and decor is the highlight of this place as the sushi is just plain terrible . when it hit our table it was luke-warm , chewy and pretty much awful . check please !
0	i adore & know my phad thai , and theirs is definitely not phad thai . got take out , and there noodles were dry , bland , and literally had no colour to it . barely any meat , flavour or spice . waste of $ 11 which is actually a bit much considering i 've had some amazing phad thai for only $ 8-9 bucks . never going there again .
0	we spent almost $ 40 and none of the food came out right . this place is unexpectedly bad . we ordered to go at 5 pm and the food was not ready till 6 pm . the cook didn 't start making the food until we got there , not to mention she didn 't even know what we ordered . what kind of restaurant is that ? we are definitely not going back .
0	while meandering around the grange food court , looking for cheap scraps of food on my lunch hour , i found mean bao . cool signage , cool vibe . anyways , i ended up with the smallest bao i have seen in my life . at $ 4.00 each , you would expect the filling to be substantial . nothing here . bland taste , 3 / 4 of my bao was filled with peanuts . i had the pork belly bao . there was absolutely no value to be found here . back to bmb !
0	my wife and i went for the first time and we both got baked chicken . she got cabbage and i got greens . the chicken was very dry and had very little flavor and the veggies had very little taste as well . the staff was so very friendly , which just so happened to be the best part of the whole experience . too bad you cant convert friendliness into great food . so disappointed . i wanted a place near home that could be my go-to spot . i guess i have to keep looking .
0	food was really good , but i had to sweat as i ate my food . talked to server , cashier , and manager about what they would do to get me in the door again ... a free sweet tea ! if you are going make sure it 's comfortable in there as they really hurt my thoughts of tin tin . thanks manager for nothing , enjoy our money it won 't happen again .
0	this has to be the worst new opening on the westside in a long time ! fatty chicken , tracing paper thin cut beef in our combo was less than desirable to say the least . sorry yoshinoya , but you have seen us the one and only time in your resturant .
0	the " steak " i ordered here was a few overfried pieces of meat with some greens overgreesed with horrible oil that smells and tastes like old machine oil , and i really hope i am not going to die tonight . the brown rice was a clump of overboiled texture resembling barley , so i am not sure it is even rice .
0	the hostess was a bitch , so this place gets a 1 star . the food itself is actually pretty good , but that doesn 't override the bad service .
0	a joke bad service with horrible ideas and bad suggestions ... staff has know idea what they are serving and getting service even chopsticks to eat with sucks ... third times the charm but not here .
0	three servers asked what i wanted to drink . one finally brought it to me . and they had no coke , only pepsi . of the vast buffet spread , only 2 or 3 items looked halfway appetizing . the sushi , rock hard and cold and made of the wrong type of rice , was especially atrocious , making the packaged stuff at kroger seem fit for japanese royalty . i think $ 3.49 is the appropriate price for this buffet , but i paid ten times that -- after an inexplicably long wait to get in .
0	they have the nerve to charge you for cake charge of 15 dollars a person ....
0	akita sushi was dirty , sticky menus , unfriendly to the point of rude waitresses and poor quality sushi ... don 't waste your time with akita sushi ... make the drive down to newmarket to golden maki on leslie , worth the trip .
0	the wife and i had some expectations and were very disappointed and left hungry . service was terrible and got stuck seated right next to another couple . my mama always said if you can 't say anything nice , don 't say anything at all . bleh .
0	i found plastic twice in the black dragon roll . my mom 's shrimp nigiri was dry to the point where the skin was basically flaking off , and my brother 's sashimi was also so dry it looked pruney . i guess my dad 's fried seafood udon noodles were ok to look at and eat though . i really wouldn 't recommend this to anyone .
0	rumor has it that the sashimi house will move into that location . so , i have gone from 4 stars in november 2009 to 1 star in march 2012 .
0	thinking i 'd get a comped meal or at least a free sake bomb , i asked to talk to the manager . the manager simply pointed at the bug and said " bad bug " and that was that . never again .
0	showed up there last night to find a small , hand-written sign on the locked door to the effect " sorry for the inconvenience .. " there was an indication that they expect to re-open , but then most restaurants do . and since this was already the second incarnation at this location , it 's hard to imagine someone taking a third roll of the dice . pity . this area could definitely use an indian restaurant . now if only people would actually eat there .
0	( at least the az location ) i was very upset to see another great restaurant close its doors ... it will be sorely missed . to cleo and the rest staff we have come to know and love , i am very sorry to see you go and wish you all well in your future endeavors .
0	went here with a friend for lunch and midway through our meal , noticed a live worm in the sushi . i was so shocked and appalled i completely forgot to take photographic evidence . when i called the waiter over she quickly took the dish away . obviously , we left immediately . i called public health that afternoon who investigated and got back to me with 48 hours - their freezer was " working " but there was no way to tell if they were properly processing their food by guidelines . in any case - be careful and check your sushi for any live parasites from this place .
0	mediocre at best . the chicken was dry and the food just salty and blend . you can go to any chinese restaurant for way better food at half the price .
0	alert ! pho bang is now pho thanh . the only thing that i had here was banh mi . so far it is very good but it takes forever ! ! ! there are too many waiters and not enough cook . i don 't know if this is true anymore but waiter from this restaurant does not get tips , the owner takes it all . that 's the price waiters here pay for getting paid under the table .
0	while the staff is friendly and the food is actually quite good . i 've now had diarrhea twice from this place . while its possible it was the spices , not ruling out uncleanliness given the past reviewers .
0	i have one more suggestion . it is always best to read a comment before responding . that just makes sense . clearly you did not .
0	i was sending someone out there to pick up the order and hadn 't heard from them . so i called and they hadn 't done the order . i had to call my pickup person and tell them to turn around and come back . man , that was disappointing , with the reviews i read they were suppose to be good . people just forget that they only get 1 first impression . i was looking for a good dependable local meat processor for a restaurant concept .. oh well . i 'll have to look elsewhere i suppose .
0	surprised at the vacancy and tables available on a friday evening . each time i went in the past , it was packed . i wondered why and finally figured out ! i ordered the 15 piece sashimi . when it arrived , i thought the presentation was top notch . however , when i looked at the toro and maguro , i knew the quality has changed . once i put it in my mouth , the fish was not properly prepared . the sashimi contained a lot of tendon , poor quality and not acceptable . a true japanese sashimi chef would not have accepted amd present it to customers . i will not recommend .
0	grabs a napkin wipes her face and then walks into the back kitchen where i can see through the apron her preparing food . never washing her hands . yuck yuck yuck .
0	we had 4 different dishes ... underwhelmed . such promise : (
0	mango sticky rice had nasty white goop for sauce instead of coconut milk , and the rice was not prepared properly . basil eggplant chicken was way oily and bland . basil beef fried rice was cheap on beef , vegetables , and basil . never coming here again .
0	if bazaar meats was a woman , it would be an air headed gold digger . they are all about presentation and not putting any effort into content . pretty containers , clever serving styles , but we did not come in for new serving dish ideas for my next dinner party . flavors were so disappointing . very plain simple flavors , nothing even coming close to complex or interesting . most were just ridiculously salty . i don 't an more expensive dinner when it is worth the taste . however , we spent over $ 100 per person , for what equated to a container of salt slapped down on the table .
0	stopped in for happy hour to test this place out before a full splurge on a sushi dinner . i would have found more enjoyment in cutting up my individual $ 1 bills and creating some sort of wreath or maybe a tiny christmas tree . anything but choking down super tough seaweed , eating fry 's sushi counter grade rolls while dodging the glaring looks from a lackluster waitress . especially loved watching the chef slick his greasy hair into his little cap and not wash his hands before throwing his gloves on . yummy . i hope whatever replaces this joint does a better job .
0	bowl of pho and glass of chai tea $ 16.99 . went to charge to my room and restaurant manager " sung " argued that i could not because i was not authorized . he refused to call the front desk , i contacted them on my phone and the front desk manager had to contact him. turns out he didn 't know how to use his system . all around between service food and my experience when paying i would not recommend this restaurant .
0	i understand it 's inside a casino and you 're gonna pay higher prices but at least try to make it worth the price tag . crazy price mark up ! ! ! !
0	selection and quality are gone . was once good , years ago , now hotdogs , burgers , pizza and noodles . chinese and mexican are all carb dishes , save some cheap bowl of something i cant make out . very little protein , and what there is isn 't worth the price . so very sad . don 't bother . wasn 't even worth the price after i used a bogo coupon . the grand cafe is much better . eat there .
0	owner is a bit rude . we went from etobicoke to this place which is quite far just for undhiyu but he reacted a bit rude . i know it was my mistake i should have called him before going there as he said we have to inform him first and place the order over the phone but since last few days i was having cravings for undhiyu . he could have been replied in a better way rather than being rude . plus these people are really really slow ! !
0	the prices are so ridiculously expensive , you would think it would at least be served with in a nice glass ? shaved ice was served like it was randomly thrown together , the bowl was splashed with the red bean sauce everywhere . not that it tastes horrible ... just that you shouldn 't pay a premium for sth that looks even worse than tea 168 ... don 't come here .
0	all employees were very disrespectful to our whole group i can understand why it wasnt a full club wont be comming back
0	i had to flag down 3 people before getting my order . do not take american express . will not come back .
0	food was so so . fish tacos were fishy and when mentioned to the waiter he did nothing , besides give us the check immediately . never going back .
0	not really a noodle fan , but i wasn 't wowed by the experience here . pork buns were tasteless and i should have brought my trusty bottle of hoisin sauce as service wasn 't the best either . such a disappointment as the ny location was so hyped up . i hope david chang reads this before its too late . will not be back .
0	first of all , for a $ $ $ $ restaurant , you have a laminated paper menu . strike one . you have this weird ceiling thing that is supposed to set the mood , but all it does is make you feel claustrophobic . strike two . then , you have like 5 people serving you , none of which explain actually explain this confusing menu.strike three . four of us ... 4 appetizers and four entrees , our bill was 350 bucks . entrees are the same size as the appetizers . i wouldn 't eat here again if this was the only place open in the whole hotel .
0	i felt like the chicken tasted odd , and having never eaten undercooked poultry before , that may have been it . that being said the staff was very nice , and the place was comfortable , but i 've been feeling sick ever since i ate there , and that 's all it takes for 1 star . health first guys , sorry .
0	very bland flavors , too much rice , and the nigiri was well below average . service was crappy as well . our group got there at 250pm during lunch hours and they tried to charge us for dinner hours when it clearly says on thier menu that the price switch starts at 3pm . very dissapointed again . that was my last visit ever .
0	we ordered papaya salad and it was so sweet , never had that before . the beef larb was just plain beef w s few pieces of lettuce and some lime juice . the bbq chicken was frickin ' fried , wtf ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! can 't even make thai tea right either the glass of water was scrumptious though
0	just get a burger or chicken somewhere .... food was bland . i have nothing nice to say about it . that 's what i get for having a meal in a food court lol
0	that 's horrible customer service ! luckily for my fiancee and i , cynthia 's chinese restaurant in the same plaza was open for another hour and a half , where we enjoyed excellent service and very delicious food .
0	we have tried to come here on multiple occasions within the posted busoness hours and they have not been open any time we 've been down ! how do you expect to do business when you 're hours of operation are inconsistent with your posted busoness hours ? i 'll give it one more try and if they 're not open again , i wont bother ever going back , even if i know they 're open . what a pitty .
0	i 've seen better health standards in third world countries .
0	all i can say is stay away from this place .. horrible experience with the employees and food just horrible ..
0	we ordered the crispy beef , but got burnt beef instead . this restaurant has no problem serving burnt food to its customers . even the waitress saw that the food was burnt and served it anyway . they did offer to make us another , but only after we complained .
0	it was cold and tasted premade . they brought the food out within 2 or 3 minutes of us ordering , so there is no friggin way they cooked it for us . panda express is better than this , so called food . is there a real chinese restaurant in the valley ? been here 2 months and haven 't found one yet .
0	i called ahead and ordered for a pickup and my husband stopped on time on his way home from work and stood at the counter for 10 minutes and no one acknowledged him . so , he walked out . i called and spoke with asian women and she could care less about my complaint . if she was a smart business women she would have offered us a free delivery or something to resolve our frustration .
0	i will not be going back to that place again .
0	my lips are itchy , my head is hurting and i am thirsty as hell . which is my indicator for too much of the silent killer . i will not eat here again .
0	my husband and i always check yelp for reviews before we go to a new place . we ordered carry out teriyaki salmon , chicken katsu and a side of edamame . the food was hot but there was barely any sauce on our entrees and it was bland . the edamame was so small , maybe 2 beans per pod . we asked for chili sauce and had to pay a dollar for 4 tiny plastic cups . i will never go back again
0	all i can say is yuk and thats not a chinese for terrible this is probley the most disgusting dim sum ever alot of deep fried dishes the place had a nasty stinge when i walked in on a high note the staff was quite friendly ..... they better be for the food ... and i use the term loosley ...... they are serving
0	they are extremely slower than the sloth . no one will listen to you , after calling so many times they will come to you . there will be 8-9 servers in the front desk but no one will care about you , they will be busy in their talks . coming to the food , not at all good . chicken pakoda was like chilli pakoda , thick layer of gram flour . biryani was too oily tasted like fried rice . at the end the gulab jamun , which they put in microwave for 5 minutes and the result was it became like a chewing gum and too hot that we have wait for it to cool down little so that we can eat it .
0	sounds great on paper , but nothing what it looks and sounds ! ! ! ! pretty disappointed overall i gotta say ... sorry !
0	we tried the spring mountain place first and was awesome . we saw that there was location on rainbow and looked up menu different from spring mountain . went in to try it and the taste is better at spring mountain very different here did not taste right . portion kinda the same but the original place is always better . well tried it and will not be back . highly recommend spring mountain instead of this place .
0	i will never ever think about going here again in life !
0	i will tell you one thing , tips aren 't mandatory . this is the job you chose and you know what kind of pay it comes with , i have no problem giving tips to people who deserve them but not someone of that demeanor ... you lost a customer as my family was a big fan of the food but with that being said i would never recommend this place to anyone and if anyone asks , don 't go here . the food can be amazing but that dosen 't make up for terrible customer service .
0	really understaffing even on weekends when many people are waiting . only one big table on the second floor fits more than 6 table . around 2 small tables are not useable . so you better make a reservation before you go otherwise you will be waiting there for hours watching others eating . people leave but they serve extremely slow and clean the table . it 's just long long waiting which doesn 't worth the service that included in the bill . i do not recommend and will not go again
0	all i have to say is what you see on the menu is not what you 're gonna get. and if you 're ok with cockroaches on the walls and floors , the this is the place to eat .
0	seating is limited here but there were 3 empty tables that just needed to be bussed . after 5 min of standing around , one of the chefs yelled for a table to be bussed but it never happened . not a single waiter or host made eye contact with us and since it doesn 't feel great to stand at the front of a restaurant unacknowledged , we walked out . you have 1 job : customer service .
0	? they didn 't even give us last call or anything .. they messed up our food and took forever to actually take our order thanks guys .. then they came and dropped off the check and mentioned multiple times how they are closing yeah we get it . if you want amazing customer service and fantastic food please go to ponchos in summerlin they 'll get your order right not kick you out and make sure they tell you when last call is ! imagine that amazing customer service does exist .
0	all in all a horrible experience they messed up my daughters meal manage to include a completely burnt fried egg inside of chicken fried rice just poorly mismanaged version of this restaurant i expect it be shut down soon too horrible horrible example of pf chang they should be ashamed .
0	all i wanted to do was buy an orchid ... it was on sale for $ 14.99 but rang up as $ 25.99 and it took 3 managers and 15 minutes to solve the problem ... turns out , the sign was in front of the wrong orchids ... too bad they don 't offer refunds for time wasted ... my advice : find a better way to handle these " price check situations " dislike .
0	got this tall cup of pretty much just an ice slushie instead with boba for $ 5 ... pretty disappointed .
0	spring rolls , crab rangoon , maybe some rice to go with . the rangoon might have been passable even without crab , but it was soggy along the bottom . the spring rolls were crisp , but i don 't think i even have words for what was wrong with the flavor . never again .
0	even confirmed they got xtra spicy and they said yes . there was no spice at all . even without i wouldn 't eat here again . can 't find good orange chicken in this town to save my life ! !
0	' find out. tp : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / bibimbap
0	no bento boxes . this place gets more and more expensive with less value in the qty. and quality of food . i can 't see it lasting much longer . place is always empty .
0	now the dishes have been of such poor quality that i would rather eat " asian " frozen food .
0	all of the food was mediocre , between passable , and ok , nothing good , or tasty my friend blames this restaurant for making him sick
0	all of the food was very old and overcooked. not many options. lots of old and odd flavored chicken. way overpriced for what it is. go to a different buffet , you 're gonna be disappointed in this one. the place isn 't clean either. will not be returning .
0	we were very disposed in this place . this is the 2nd time we have tried this place and will be our last !
0	waitress did not say thank you for anything , seems she feels its our privilege to be there .
0	i have never seen this practice even in ayce sushi .
0	plus ... at 830 on the owner starts to rush and literally kicked us out . they didn 't even want to refill our drinks or offer us any dessert . genuinely the worst place i have ever dined at and will not be returning to this place again .
0	could not believe that they have no re-usable plates or cups for eating-in . everything is served in plastic containers ! had burnt udon soup in a melting plastic bowl , ok dumplings , and so so veggie roll . very average food overall , not at all authentic or japanese . nice people working there but a disappointing experience food wise .
0	one of the worst service in toronto . won 't go back again .
0	i never write a review for restaurants because i 'm too lazy . but seriously you need to wait more than an hour to get food you ordered and the service .. ? i seriously didn 't wanted to tip them . this place speechless . they don 't even deserve 1 star . i might come back later since it 's just starting their business but i strongly doubt if they will keep the business till then . oh , the food is bad . the chicken quality is too low .
0	stood in line attempting to order . no one wanted to take an order walked out without food
0	server didn 't want me to order what i wanted to order , why have a menu ? suggested noodle soup because it wouldn 't take long but bruhh , i want to eat what i want to eat ! others may be satisfied by this service but not for me . couldn 't even have a nice meal on christmas .
0	it feels slimy and old . placed a to go order today and just got home . this is disgusting . the sushi at the mall smells better than this . salad and miso soup were alright .
0	everything was luke warm . the best word to describe this meal was .. blah . total waste of money . probably best to have a sit down dinner for the same price for way better quality . servers were super sweet and attentive .
0	so we came with a friend and ordered portuguese chicken , black pepper chicken and a cream soup. everything had a nice fried layer on it except the soup , which is far from fresh. the portions are good though , for the price. after we finished and we got the bill , the waitress wouldn 't take the money because we hadn 't tipped enough. yes , she didn 't take the bill back after i paid ( with 10 ℅ ) for a very mediocre service. would not recommend
